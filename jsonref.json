Valeska previously worked as a messenger for David Miscavige and claims she had a close relationship with his wife Shelly Miscavige (right)  57, who has not been seen in public since 2006          Valeska claims members were not allowed to look at Tom Cruise in the eye, talk to him, and had to address him as \u0027sir\u0027 when he came around . Above he is pictured in 2008 with Katie Holmes and David Miscavige          Valeska was 18 years old when she was ordered to work aboard the Freewinds ship, which is used by top management and members who pay huge sums to live onboard for weeks at a time completing high-level Scientology courses Valeska, who was 18 at the time, says she spent the next 12 years on the ship \u0027against her will.\u0027 However, in a statement to DailyMail.com, the Church of Scientology denied that Jaquier\u0027s death was a suicide and said his death had \u0027no bearing\u0027 on Valeska being transferred to Freewinds. In a death certificate provided by the church to DailyMail.com, Jaquier\u0027s cause of death was determined to be \u0027natural\u0027 from his history of heart disease.They also claim he was worth about $1.2m at the time of his death.   \u0027Ms. Paris served as a crew member aboard the Freewinds religious retreat as a volunteer religious worker from September 1996 to December 2007. She was an adult and there of her own free will as part of her religious commitment to the Church of Scientology,\u0027 a spokesperson for the church said. Valeska says that during her first six months on the ship she was working on decks and in the engine room before being moved to the restaurant.\u0027When I was first on the ship, I had my passport seized, no days off for six months, no privileges, phone calls were not allowed. I was told by the captain I was never getting off the ship,\u0027 she claims.\u0027The ship was full of blue asbestos, every night we\u0027d get on our knees, we\u0027d be picking chunks of blue asbestos with our bare hands, to this day, I have this cough which won\u0027t go away. I finally got off decks and worked in the restaurant.\u0027 She recalls one of the busiest times on the ship was during the annual Maiden Voyage, a special week-long event which saw many church VIPs come aboard the Freewinds.\u0027We worked many, many late nights. Before Maiden Voyage, we\u0027d be working until 4 a.m., and during it, we wouldn\u0027t be sleeping at all. I would fall asleep on the toilet. \u0027If you have so little sleep, you lose your memory, I\u0027d forget what people wanted to drink or even ordered to eat. During this time, I would be in COB\u0027s dining room, serving the food, and cleaning up. \u0027When he saw me on my first Maiden Voyage, he called me over and said: I forgot I\u0027d sent you here, how do you like it? and I said: No, I really didn\u0027t like it at first, but now I\u0027m getting used to it.\u0027\u0027\u0027He couldn\u0027t believe it, and said: Why don\u0027t you like it?\u0027          Valeska said she once broke the rules and had to serve Tom Cruise and then-girlfriend Penelope Cruz on Freewinds in 2003.  She claims females were forbidden by Miscavige from serving Cruise because, \u0027He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027          Valeska was a second-generation Scientologist, starting off as a cadet at its headquarters in Saint Hill, England, she then signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org, even though she was only 14. She later moved to Clearwater, Florida, where the church is basedAfter Maiden Voyage in 2003, Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz came aboard the ship and crew members were expected to follow a strict set of rules while tending to them, she claims.  \u0027They\u0027d spend all their time ing and playing around on a $2,000-a-day yacht with Miscavige, meanwhile, we\u0027d be working under horrific conditions.\u0027We were shown pictures of Tom, Penelope and all his entourage so we knew who they all were. \u0027We were told not to tell anyone they were coming, otherwise you\u0027d be sent to the RPF. You can\u0027t look at him in the eye, you can\u0027t talk to him, address him as sir, and stay the f*** out of his way.\u0027We then found out that he was coming on the ship tomorrow, so COB was asking who was going to serve him. He ended up picking a man as he said no woman is allowed to serve him. \u0027He said, and this is the God\u0027s honest truth, right in front of me and two other women: He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027The next morning, Tom had his breakfast while COB was sleeping - he was in bed every day until midday - and the guy who was meant to serve him overslept, so I ended up serving him. \u0027He had this egg white omelette with a bunch of vegetables. Penelope came in a white dress and she had a special diet as well. \u0027She was very nice, super calm, wearing no make up, laid back, but he was very hyper. Tom and COB only drank Smart Water, all meals were specially made. I also served Penelope for dinner.\u0027Any couples not married who came on the ship were not allowed to share a cabin, but Tom was allowed a room with her. Sea Org members were angry, there was hostility about that. \u0027Every night they\u0027d watch a movie in the cinema room. He was very much in love with Penelope and happy. Penelope was getting audited at the time in 2003, she was doing Scientology for sure. When she left the Church, the auditor got in trouble.\u0027          Valeska signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org at 14 The following year, after he split from Cruz, the Mission Impossible actor came back right after Maiden Voyage and it was his 42nd birthday, but Valeska was not invited. Miscavige made sure it was a night to be remembered. Cringe-worthy YouTube clips have surfaced from the event showing Cruise, now 56, singing and dancing to the band, then proclaiming: \u0027This is incredible... It\u0027s the best birthday ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, and I mean: ever!\u0027Valeska says: \u0027The Starlight Cabaret, which is the entertainment and event space on the ship, was decorated for Tom\u0027s birthday, it looked ridiculous, there was every poster of every movie he\u0027d ever done, apart from ones with Nicole Kidman. She was considered a Suppressive Person. No Nicole posters allowed anywhere. \u0027They also did a concert and all the songs were from movies he\u0027d been in except Nicole ones. They flew his favorite Chinese chef to cook for him, this was all paid for by Scientology.\u0027I was one of the only people on the ship who was not allowed to go to his birthday, as I had the audacity to have a cold sore, I was so run down,\u0027 she says. From then on, she claims, she was taken off the ship for every Maiden Voyage. \u0027I got put in isolation, had an ethics interview, and security check to find out what my evil intentions were to COB and Shelly: Do you have an evil purpose to COB? Do you want to do something bad to him? They do this line of questioning until they find out why I am evil to them. And when you come up with nothing you get yelled at and told to confront your evil intentions,\u0027 she says.\u0027It was all a blessing in disguise, as I can\u0027t dance, and everyone was ordered to dance. There were three girls, who did dance, and then accused of flirting with him, so they were locked in a room, told to write up their crimes for being interesting in front of Tom Cruise.    Valeska says she considered Shelly (pictured left, and right, with Leah Remini) a \u0027mother figure\u0027 who took her under her wing           This is the Scientology base in Twin Peaks, California, where Shelly is believed to live          Valeska doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested and thinks she is not there against her will\u0027The only Scientology celebrity that COB likes is Tom Cruise, the others are all below him. Tom Cruise would call him on the phone, they\u0027d be on the phone all the time,\u0027 she claims.       Although Valeska feared Miscavige, she claims she had a close relationship with his wife, Shelly Miscavige, who has not been seen in public in more than a decade. \u0027But my relationship with Shelly was great, she kept an eye on me, and was keen for me to keep up with my education. Scientology didn\u0027t care, and we were never sent to school as Sea Org members,\u0027 she claims.  Valeska says Shelly was like a \u0027mother figure\u0027 to her and she kept in touch with her through letters even after she was sent away on Freewinds. \u0027We wrote letters for years, she took me under her wing. When I was first engaged to a guy, she wrote two pages demanding to know everything. From the age of 15 to 25, for ten years we would write back and forth,\u0027 she says.August marked the 12-year anniversary since Shelly was last seen in public. Former church members have speculated that she has been at a secret Scientology base called Twin Peaks in the San Bernardino Mountains since 2006.Valeska, however, has a different theory and doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested.\u0027She\u0027s not there against her will, the treatment she\u0027ll be getting is a lot better than most would receive. She\u0027s living in the mountains and, yes, sure, she\u0027s under security watch and it won\u0027t be like before, as she was living like a queen,\u0027 she says.\u0027Yet, it\u0027s not like she\u0027ll be in RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) conditions. Imagine his wife going into the RPF, she knows more than anyone about COB\u0027s secrets, he is going to have to keep her happy.\u0027The church has long denied any rumors suggesting Shelly is missing and have insisted that she is devoting her time to the work of the Church of Scientology.Valeska says she used to see Shelly on the ship when she came aboard for Maiden Voyage and the two kept in touch through written correspondence about their personal lives, including Valeska\u0027s first marriage. Weddings were common among Sea Org members and most married as teens and twenty-somethings since sexual contact is not allowed before marriage. \u0027When I was on the ship, I married a guy called Roberto, I was only 20. Shelly was pleased, she told me: Good, you have someone to look after you, I don\u0027t need to do it. She wanted to see all the photos from my wedding album,\u0027 she says.          Valeska eventually fled the church after completing RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) in Australia. She now lives with her husband and three kids - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, in Brisbane           An email conversation between Valeska and her father Jean-Francois Paris, shows how leaving that church has forbidden her from speaking to her own dad  The negative publicity rocked the church and Miscavige.\u0027I would hear him scream at the top of his lungs while I was working in the kitchen next to the execs room, I would be shaking, it was so scary. \u0027When Lisa McPherson happened, he changed. All of the execs he was friends with, that all disappeared. His circle went even smaller,\u0027 she alleges.Shelly\u0027s usually strong relationship with her husband began to falter - he dismissed the whole of his board of executives in favor of younger, more eager to please, dedicated Sea Org members, such as Lou Stuckenbrock, for whom he created the position \u0027COB Communicator\u0027.\u0027Shelly became more and more stressed out. COB would be in the dining room with his Communicator Lou and she would eat afterwards,\u0027 Valeska claims.\u0027In her letters she would never say anything, but she was writing less and less, I got the sense she was more stressed. She wasn\u0027t perfect, but she stood by COB for years, and I never saw them argue, but I always saw that he was very close with Lou.\u0027In 2005, he said in a meeting that Shelly had been taken off his lines, but he wasn\u0027t going to orce her, he was way too qualified to ever marry any other Sea Org member. She was extremely dedicated to him. His words were: She messed up his communication lines.\u0027 Shelly has since retreated from public life once a prominent member of the church, she was even absent at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\u0027s wedding in 2006.In 2013, Hollywood actress and famous Church defector Leah Remini filed a missing person report with the Los Angeles Police Department for Shelly. Police eventually said that they had interviewed Shelly and confirmed she wasn\u0027t being held against her will and didn\u0027t want to make any public statement.  Valeska\u0027s correspondence with Shelly came to a stop after she left. She says her time at the church worsened in 2007, after she was sent to England \u0027on a mission\u0027 during Maiden Voyage.Only days into it, Valeska got into hot water for daring to speak to a married man and she was ordered back to the Freewinds and sent to the engine room. After all this treatment, Valeska was suicidal and desperate to get out.\u0027In my mind, I was either going to end it or get off that ship,\u0027 she adds. But Valeska also had no skills for the real world, her brother Raphael, 36, and father Jean, 66, were and still are in the church today, she\u0027d never be allowed to see them again if she absconded.She\u0027d also \u0027disconnected\u0027 from her mother Ariane and younger sister Melissa, 38, 14 years ago when they left the Church.\u0027They wouldn\u0027t let me off this ship. I had served COB and knew their dirty little secrets. It was still hard to leave, I\u0027d been in the Sea Org since 14, I had no education, no money, never had a bank account, I had no idea how to live in the real world.  \u0027I\u0027d lose my brother and father instantly, I didn\u0027t know if my mom or sister would reconnect or where they lived. I\u0027d been indoctrinated that Scientology is life,\u0027 she says.Valeska was sent to the RPF in Australia, in the hope that it would \u0027rehabilitate\u0027 her. During this time, she met Chris Guider, a former rugby league legend in Australia who gave it all up in the 80s for Scientology.\u0027After graduating the RPF, they started making my life hell again. They were threatening to send me back to the ship, but I\u0027d already decided I would never, ever go back to that place again,\u0027 she says.\u0027When we finally got free, we had no one to judge us, I could watch TV when I wanted to, I had a normal room that wasn\u0027t a dormitory, I felt so much freedom. That\u0027s when I realized that Scientology was, in a nutshell, s**t.\u0027I hadn\u0027t seen my mom and sister for ages. I hadn\u0027t seen my mom for so long that when I first saw her, I went up to the wrong person. We didn\u0027t recognize each other. \u0027My dad sent me a text saying he was going to disconnect from me for talking to my mom and sister, this was at the same time as I was eight months pregnant with my first child.\u0027Today, Chris and Valeska now live happily in Brisbane and have three children - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, three - but still live under the shadow of Scientology\u0027s disconnection policy.Valeska said: \u0027I have three children who\u0027ve never met their grandfather. I haven\u0027t spoken to my brother since 2010. My family is destroyed. But we got out and we\u0027re having a good life. Hopefully my dad and brother will wake up one day, and my door will always be open for them.\u0027In a statement to DailyMail.com the church said: \u0027What has been said about us all too often—as is the case here—is pure propaganda. It is inaccurate and intentionally avoids showing who Scientologists really are and what we do. \u0027Propagandists look to capitalize on the growing curiosity about Scientology. They have manufactured controversies where there are none while refusing to show the Church, its organizations, its humanitarian programs as well as its unprecedented growth in Churches worldwide.

Now that it has been proven that items are often not cheaper over the weekend, it is no surprise that stores are choosing to map their own route and stick to low costs all year round. Richard Hyman, a veteran retail adviser, said: \u0027Black Friday has probably been the most stupid retail import from the USA this country has ever seen.\u0027Nine out of 10 Black Friday items cheaper at other times of the year Further research from Idealo found that nearly all items could be found cheaper at different points around the year.They compared prices of over 20,000 products over a 12 month period and discovered that some of the best selling products on Black Friday were substantially less expensive on different dates.Below are the top 10 product categories and how much shoppers can save by buying the items at alternative times of the year. It suggests, for example, that the best day to buy a DSLR camera is 5 September, according to its historic data The only item that was cheaper on Black Friday was laptops:   1.

Avenatti posted another tweet late Wednesday, saying: \u0027I want to be clear: I DID NOT commit domestic violence nor have I ever committed domestic violence\u0027          Avenatti later tweeted: \u0027Thank you to everyone who has reached out with supportive messages and offers of assistance\u0027Avenatti later tweeted: \u0027Thank you to everyone who has reached out with supportive messages and offers of assistance. It means the world to me.\u0027\u0027I have always been an advocate of women\u0027s rights and equality \u0026amp I always will be. I will not be intimidated into stopping my pursuit of justice and what is right.\u0027 Avenatti posted another tweet late Wednesday, saying: \u0027I want to be clear: I DID NOT commit domestic violence nor have I ever committed domestic violence. \u0027I did not strike any woman nor have I ever. I did not strike my ex-wife in the face nor did I hit anyone else in the face. \u0027I am a decent man \u0026amp I look forward to being exonerated.\u0027           Initial reports indicated that the woman in question was Lisa Storie, Avenatti\u0027s estranged wife. But she released a statement saying she was not involved  According to the LAPD, the incident occurred near the 10,000 block of Santa Monica Blvd. Officers took a police report, and Avenatti was arrested at 2.05pm at the same address Wednesday.He has now been booked and charged with 273.5APC intimate partner violence.\u0027It was an altercation between him and a victim,\u0027 the LAPD spokesman said, but refused to confirm the identity of the woman or details of the alleged violence.\u0027We don\u0027t give those kind of details out because it\u0027s domestic violence. We don\u0027t want to prevent future victims coming forward by releasing this kind of information. The court hearing will be given out by the District Attorney\u0027s office.\u0027Initial reports indicated that the woman in question was Lisa Storie, Avenatti\u0027s estranged wife.Avenatti filed for orce from Storie last year. In court paper, Storie described her estranged husband as \u0027emotionally abusive\u0027, \u0027hot-tempered\u0027 and \u0027angry and vindictive\u0027.But she released a statement on Wednesday saying she was not involved in the alleged incident.           Avenatti\u0027s first wife, Christine Avenatti Carlin, also defended her ex-husband on Twitter          \u0027I have known Michael Avenatti for over 26 years we met when he was 21 years old and we were married for 13 years,\u0027 she tweeted late Wednesday. \u0027Michael has ALWAYS been a kind loving father to our two daughters and husband to me\u0027 She also defended Avenatti, describing him as someone who would never hit a woman. \u0027I haven\u0027t seen Michael in months. It\u0027s a complete fabrication. Bruises on my face? It\u0027s insanity,\u0027 she told CNN. \u0027Especially a woman. He\u0027s got two daughters.\u0027   Storie\u0027s lawyer released a statement which read: \u0027My client and I have reviewed the TMZ article alleging that my client, Lisa Storie-Avenatti, has been injured and that Michael Avenatti has been arrested as a result of some incident that occurred between them.\u0027This article is not true as it pertains to my client. Ms Storie-Avenatti was not subject to any such incident on Tuesday night.\u0027\u0027Further, she was not at Mr Avenatti\u0027s apartment on the date that this alleged incident occurred.\u0027 \u0027My client states that there has never been domestic violence in her relationship with Michael and that she has never known Michael to be physically violent toward anyone.\u0027 \u0027My client requests that the media respect her privacy and that of the parties\u0027 young son.\u0027 Avenatti\u0027s first wife, Christine Avenatti Carlin, also defended her ex-husband on Twitter.\u0027I have known Michael Avenatti for over 26 years we met when he was 21 years old and we were married for 13 years,\u0027 she tweeted late Wednesday. \u0027Michael has ALWAYS been a kind loving father to our two daughters and husband to me. He has NEVER been abusive to me or anyone else. He is a good man.\u0027 Avenatti became famous as Stormy Daniels\u0027 lawyer and pursued the president and those close to him relentlessly for months, taunting Trump in interviews and baiting him and his lawyers in tweets.Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and has sued to invalidate the confidentiality agreement she signed days before the 2016 presidential election that prevents her discussing it. She also sued Trump and his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, alleging defamation.The Vermont Democratic Party canceled events planned for Friday and Saturday, where Avenatti was scheduled to speak, and is refunding ticket sales.           Alyssa Milano, the Charmed actress and liberal political activist who has appeared with Avenatti at anti-Trump rallies, said she is disavowing the lawyer after news broke of his arrestAlyssa Milano, the Charmed actress and liberal political activist who has appeared with Avenatti at anti-Trump rallies, said she is disavowing the lawyer after news broke of his arrest.\u0027Totally disgusting,\u0027 the Who\u0027s The Boss star tweeted on Wednesday in response to the original report of Avenatti\u0027s arrest. \u0027And before anyone asks me, yes, I\u0027m disavowing Avenatti.

Valeska previously worked as a messenger for David Miscavige and claims she had a close relationship with his wife Shelly Miscavige (right)  57, who has not been seen in public since 2006          Valeska claims members were not allowed to look at Tom Cruise in the eye, talk to him, and had to address him as \u0027sir\u0027 when he came around . Above he is pictured in 2008 with Katie Holmes and David Miscavige          Valeska was 18 years old when she was ordered to work aboard the Freewinds ship, which is used by top management and members who pay huge sums to live onboard for weeks at a time completing high-level Scientology courses Valeska, who was 18 at the time, says she spent the next 12 years on the ship \u0027against her will.\u0027 However, in a statement to DailyMail.com, the Church of Scientology denied that Jaquier\u0027s death was a suicide and said his death had \u0027no bearing\u0027 on Valeska being transferred to Freewinds. In a death certificate provided by the church to DailyMail.com, Jaquier\u0027s cause of death was determined to be \u0027natural\u0027 from his history of heart disease.They also claim he was worth about $1.2m at the time of his death.   \u0027Ms. Paris served as a crew member aboard the Freewinds religious retreat as a volunteer religious worker from September 1996 to December 2007. She was an adult and there of her own free will as part of her religious commitment to the Church of Scientology,\u0027 a spokesperson for the church said. Valeska says that during her first six months on the ship she was working on decks and in the engine room before being moved to the restaurant.\u0027When I was first on the ship, I had my passport seized, no days off for six months, no privileges, phone calls were not allowed. I was told by the captain I was never getting off the ship,\u0027 she claims.\u0027The ship was full of blue asbestos, every night we\u0027d get on our knees, we\u0027d be picking chunks of blue asbestos with our bare hands, to this day, I have this cough which won\u0027t go away. I finally got off decks and worked in the restaurant.\u0027 She recalls one of the busiest times on the ship was during the annual Maiden Voyage, a special week-long event which saw many church VIPs come aboard the Freewinds.\u0027We worked many, many late nights. Before Maiden Voyage, we\u0027d be working until 4 a.m., and during it, we wouldn\u0027t be sleeping at all. I would fall asleep on the toilet. \u0027If you have so little sleep, you lose your memory, I\u0027d forget what people wanted to drink or even ordered to eat. During this time, I would be in COB\u0027s dining room, serving the food, and cleaning up. \u0027When he saw me on my first Maiden Voyage, he called me over and said: I forgot I\u0027d sent you here, how do you like it? and I said: No, I really didn\u0027t like it at first, but now I\u0027m getting used to it.\u0027\u0027\u0027He couldn\u0027t believe it, and said: Why don\u0027t you like it?\u0027          Valeska said she once broke the rules and had to serve Tom Cruise and then-girlfriend Penelope Cruz on Freewinds in 2003.  She claims females were forbidden by Miscavige from serving Cruise because, \u0027He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027          Valeska was a second-generation Scientologist, starting off as a cadet at its headquarters in Saint Hill, England, she then signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org, even though she was only 14. She later moved to Clearwater, Florida, where the church is basedAfter Maiden Voyage in 2003, Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz came aboard the ship and crew members were expected to follow a strict set of rules while tending to them, she claims.  \u0027They\u0027d spend all their time ing and playing around on a $2,000-a-day yacht with Miscavige, meanwhile, we\u0027d be working under horrific conditions.\u0027We were shown pictures of Tom, Penelope and all his entourage so we knew who they all were. \u0027We were told not to tell anyone they were coming, otherwise you\u0027d be sent to the RPF. You can\u0027t look at him in the eye, you can\u0027t talk to him, address him as sir, and stay the f*** out of his way.\u0027We then found out that he was coming on the ship tomorrow, so COB was asking who was going to serve him. He ended up picking a man as he said no woman is allowed to serve him. \u0027He said, and this is the God\u0027s honest truth, right in front of me and two other women: He\u0027s so good looking that if you serve him, you\u0027ll end up falling in love with him.\u0027The next morning, Tom had his breakfast while COB was sleeping - he was in bed every day until midday - and the guy who was meant to serve him overslept, so I ended up serving him. \u0027He had this egg white omelette with a bunch of vegetables. Penelope came in a white dress and she had a special diet as well. \u0027She was very nice, super calm, wearing no make up, laid back, but he was very hyper. Tom and COB only drank Smart Water, all meals were specially made. I also served Penelope for dinner.\u0027Any couples not married who came on the ship were not allowed to share a cabin, but Tom was allowed a room with her. Sea Org members were angry, there was hostility about that. \u0027Every night they\u0027d watch a movie in the cinema room. He was very much in love with Penelope and happy. Penelope was getting audited at the time in 2003, she was doing Scientology for sure. When she left the Church, the auditor got in trouble.\u0027          Valeska signed a billion-year contract to be a full-time member of the Sea Org at 14 The following year, after he split from Cruz, the Mission Impossible actor came back right after Maiden Voyage and it was his 42nd birthday, but Valeska was not invited. Miscavige made sure it was a night to be remembered. Cringe-worthy YouTube clips have surfaced from the event showing Cruise, now 56, singing and dancing to the band, then proclaiming: \u0027This is incredible... It\u0027s the best birthday ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, and I mean: ever!\u0027Valeska says: \u0027The Starlight Cabaret, which is the entertainment and event space on the ship, was decorated for Tom\u0027s birthday, it looked ridiculous, there was every poster of every movie he\u0027d ever done, apart from ones with Nicole Kidman. She was considered a Suppressive Person. No Nicole posters allowed anywhere. \u0027They also did a concert and all the songs were from movies he\u0027d been in except Nicole ones. They flew his favorite Chinese chef to cook for him, this was all paid for by Scientology.\u0027I was one of the only people on the ship who was not allowed to go to his birthday, as I had the audacity to have a cold sore, I was so run down,\u0027 she says. From then on, she claims, she was taken off the ship for every Maiden Voyage. \u0027I got put in isolation, had an ethics interview, and security check to find out what my evil intentions were to COB and Shelly: Do you have an evil purpose to COB? Do you want to do something bad to him? They do this line of questioning until they find out why I am evil to them. And when you come up with nothing you get yelled at and told to confront your evil intentions,\u0027 she says.\u0027It was all a blessing in disguise, as I can\u0027t dance, and everyone was ordered to dance. There were three girls, who did dance, and then accused of flirting with him, so they were locked in a room, told to write up their crimes for being interesting in front of Tom Cruise.    Valeska says she considered Shelly (pictured left, and right, with Leah Remini) a \u0027mother figure\u0027 who took her under her wing           This is the Scientology base in Twin Peaks, California, where Shelly is believed to live          Valeska doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested and thinks she is not there against her will\u0027The only Scientology celebrity that COB likes is Tom Cruise, the others are all below him. Tom Cruise would call him on the phone, they\u0027d be on the phone all the time,\u0027 she claims.       Although Valeska feared Miscavige, she claims she had a close relationship with his wife, Shelly Miscavige, who has not been seen in public in more than a decade. \u0027But my relationship with Shelly was great, she kept an eye on me, and was keen for me to keep up with my education. Scientology didn\u0027t care, and we were never sent to school as Sea Org members,\u0027 she claims.  Valeska says Shelly was like a \u0027mother figure\u0027 to her and she kept in touch with her through letters even after she was sent away on Freewinds. \u0027We wrote letters for years, she took me under her wing. When I was first engaged to a guy, she wrote two pages demanding to know everything. From the age of 15 to 25, for ten years we would write back and forth,\u0027 she says.August marked the 12-year anniversary since Shelly was last seen in public. Former church members have speculated that she has been at a secret Scientology base called Twin Peaks in the San Bernardino Mountains since 2006.Valeska, however, has a different theory and doesn\u0027t believe Shelly is living in a \u0027Scientology prison\u0027 as others have suggested.\u0027She\u0027s not there against her will, the treatment she\u0027ll be getting is a lot better than most would receive. She\u0027s living in the mountains and, yes, sure, she\u0027s under security watch and it won\u0027t be like before, as she was living like a queen,\u0027 she says.\u0027Yet, it\u0027s not like she\u0027ll be in RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) conditions. Imagine his wife going into the RPF, she knows more than anyone about COB\u0027s secrets, he is going to have to keep her happy.\u0027The church has long denied any rumors suggesting Shelly is missing and have insisted that she is devoting her time to the work of the Church of Scientology.Valeska says she used to see Shelly on the ship when she came aboard for Maiden Voyage and the two kept in touch through written correspondence about their personal lives, including Valeska\u0027s first marriage. Weddings were common among Sea Org members and most married as teens and twenty-somethings since sexual contact is not allowed before marriage. \u0027When I was on the ship, I married a guy called Roberto, I was only 20. Shelly was pleased, she told me: Good, you have someone to look after you, I don\u0027t need to do it. She wanted to see all the photos from my wedding album,\u0027 she says.          Valeska eventually fled the church after completing RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) in Australia. She now lives with her husband and three kids - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, in Brisbane           An email conversation between Valeska and her father Jean-Francois Paris, shows how leaving that church has forbidden her from speaking to her own dad  The negative publicity rocked the church and Miscavige.\u0027I would hear him scream at the top of his lungs while I was working in the kitchen next to the execs room, I would be shaking, it was so scary. \u0027When Lisa McPherson happened, he changed. All of the execs he was friends with, that all disappeared. His circle went even smaller,\u0027 she alleges.Shelly\u0027s usually strong relationship with her husband began to falter - he dismissed the whole of his board of executives in favor of younger, more eager to please, dedicated Sea Org members, such as Lou Stuckenbrock, for whom he created the position \u0027COB Communicator\u0027.\u0027Shelly became more and more stressed out. COB would be in the dining room with his Communicator Lou and she would eat afterwards,\u0027 Valeska claims.\u0027In her letters she would never say anything, but she was writing less and less, I got the sense she was more stressed. She wasn\u0027t perfect, but she stood by COB for years, and I never saw them argue, but I always saw that he was very close with Lou.\u0027In 2005, he said in a meeting that Shelly had been taken off his lines, but he wasn\u0027t going to orce her, he was way too qualified to ever marry any other Sea Org member. She was extremely dedicated to him. His words were: She messed up his communication lines.\u0027 Shelly has since retreated from public life once a prominent member of the church, she was even absent at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\u0027s wedding in 2006.In 2013, Hollywood actress and famous Church defector Leah Remini filed a missing person report with the Los Angeles Police Department for Shelly. Police eventually said that they had interviewed Shelly and confirmed she wasn\u0027t being held against her will and didn\u0027t want to make any public statement.  Valeska\u0027s correspondence with Shelly came to a stop after she left. She says her time at the church worsened in 2007, after she was sent to England \u0027on a mission\u0027 during Maiden Voyage.Only days into it, Valeska got into hot water for daring to speak to a married man and she was ordered back to the Freewinds and sent to the engine room. After all this treatment, Valeska was suicidal and desperate to get out.\u0027In my mind, I was either going to end it or get off that ship,\u0027 she adds. But Valeska also had no skills for the real world, her brother Raphael, 36, and father Jean, 66, were and still are in the church today, she\u0027d never be allowed to see them again if she absconded.She\u0027d also \u0027disconnected\u0027 from her mother Ariane and younger sister Melissa, 38, 14 years ago when they left the Church.\u0027They wouldn\u0027t let me off this ship. I had served COB and knew their dirty little secrets. It was still hard to leave, I\u0027d been in the Sea Org since 14, I had no education, no money, never had a bank account, I had no idea how to live in the real world.  \u0027I\u0027d lose my brother and father instantly, I didn\u0027t know if my mom or sister would reconnect or where they lived. I\u0027d been indoctrinated that Scientology is life,\u0027 she says.Valeska was sent to the RPF in Australia, in the hope that it would \u0027rehabilitate\u0027 her. During this time, she met Chris Guider, a former rugby league legend in Australia who gave it all up in the 80s for Scientology.\u0027After graduating the RPF, they started making my life hell again. They were threatening to send me back to the ship, but I\u0027d already decided I would never, ever go back to that place again,\u0027 she says.\u0027When we finally got free, we had no one to judge us, I could watch TV when I wanted to, I had a normal room that wasn\u0027t a dormitory, I felt so much freedom. That\u0027s when I realized that Scientology was, in a nutshell, s**t.\u0027I hadn\u0027t seen my mom and sister for ages. I hadn\u0027t seen my mom for so long that when I first saw her, I went up to the wrong person. We didn\u0027t recognize each other. \u0027My dad sent me a text saying he was going to disconnect from me for talking to my mom and sister, this was at the same time as I was eight months pregnant with my first child.\u0027Today, Chris and Valeska now live happily in Brisbane and have three children - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, three - but still live under the shadow of Scientology\u0027s disconnection policy.Valeska said: \u0027I have three children who\u0027ve never met their grandfather. I haven\u0027t spoken to my brother since 2010. My family is destroyed. But we got out and we\u0027re having a good life. Hopefully my dad and brother will wake up one day, and my door will always be open for them.\u0027In a statement to DailyMail.com the church said: \u0027What has been said about us all too often—as is the case here—is pure propaganda. It is inaccurate and intentionally avoids showing who Scientologists really are and what we do. \u0027Propagandists look to capitalize on the growing curiosity about Scientology. They have manufactured controversies where there are none while refusing to show the Church, its organizations, its humanitarian programs as well as its unprecedented growth in Churches worldwide.

Now that it has been proven that items are often not cheaper over the weekend, it is no surprise that stores are choosing to map their own route and stick to low costs all year round. Richard Hyman, a veteran retail adviser, said: \u0027Black Friday has probably been the most stupid retail import from the USA this country has ever seen.\u0027Nine out of 10 Black Friday items cheaper at other times of the year Further research from Idealo found that nearly all items could be found cheaper at different points around the year.They compared prices of over 20,000 products over a 12 month period and discovered that some of the best selling products on Black Friday were substantially less expensive on different dates.Below are the top 10 product categories and how much shoppers can save by buying the items at alternative times of the year. It suggests, for example, that the best day to buy a DSLR camera is 5 September, according to its historic data The only item that was cheaper on Black Friday was laptops:   1. Drones - £149 cheaper on 26 September2. Headphones - £37 cheaper on 17 August3. Lego - £31 cheaper on 17 July4. Laptops – lowest price of the year is on Black Friday5.

Lidl then tweeted a tongue-in-cheek advert for an £89 Yamaha keyboardThe German supermarket tweeted: \u0027Just because you don\u0027t have £872 to spend on a piano, doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be the next Elton\u0027, alongside a picture of an £89.99 Yamaha keyboard.The picture is also captioned \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit funny...\u0027 Twitter users were quick to praise the witty response, calling it a \u0027masterstroke\u0027 while one user said \u0027give your marketing manager a rise\u0027.The official John Lewis account then tweeted Lidl a link to its £15 children\u0027s piano with the message: \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit cheaper\u0027.One wag replied to both saying: \u0027Do you pair want to leave this argument till the weekend. I’ve heard Saturday nights all right for fighting\u0027 - a joke linked to another of Sir Elton\u0027s big hits.                        Five actors aged between four and 50 were used to play Sir Elton, using prosthetics, CGI and help from the star and his husband David Furnish to ensure they had the same mannerisms and piano playing style.Viewers are taken back through key moments in his life with scenes of the star on stadium tours, travelling on a private jet, recording Your Song, playing the piano in a local pub and performing in a school recital. It ends with Sir Elton - then little Reg Dwight - running down the stairs on Christmas morning to see his grandmother Ivy and his mother, who brought him up together because his father, Stanley, was largely absent.John Lewis has said the advert is \u0027inspired by real events\u0027 but admits the finale involves \u0027some creativity\u0027 because the singer was never gifted a piano at Christmas, but he had learned to play at his grandmother\u0027s house - and denied claims they paid him £5million to take part. It is also the second of the retailer\u0027s Christmas ads to feature Your Song after singer Ellie Goulding recorded a cover for the 2010 campaign. The  nod to Elton\u0027s mother and the influence on his career comes almost a year after her death last December.Two years before she passed away the star found the courage to apologise to her after a nearly nine-year feud that culminated in her inviting an Elton John impersonator to perform at her 90th birthday party because she missed him so much.Elton severed all contact with her after a catastrophic argument where she blamed Elton\u0027s husband, David Furnish, for turning him against her.She was also upset the Candle In The Wind singer demanded she cut all ties with her longtime friends Bob Halley and John Reid, who had both been fired from his entourage after decades working for him.But he later sent Sheila a large bouquet of white orchids for her milestone birthday and also shelled out £30,000 for Sheila to undergo a double hip replacement.When she died last year Elton spoke of his grief - but happiness that they had become close again.In September this year rumours emerged that Sir Elton had agreed to take part - but John Lewis has denied he was paid the £5million fee being mooted. They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027His husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said:  \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously. \u0027I think, you know, emotionally he is thinking about the journey he’s been on as an artist, and that moment, you know, when music came into his life at a very young age when he was encouraged by his mother and his grandmother with his piano\u0027. The Boy \u0026amp The Piano was released online at 8am this morning before being shown on ITV at 9.15pm tonight.Actor Simon Burbage plays Elton in the 1980s and 1990, while the lookalike used to recreate the scenes from the 1970s is Oliver Marshall. The singer as a teenager is played by Brandon Stein, while Hudson Trindall is performing at a piano recital and the young boy on Christmas morning is Freddie Henderson.           Sir Elton sings his first big hit Your Song in a present day gig but the advert goes all the way back to his 1950s childhood          Actor Oliver Marshall wearing prosthetics and original clothes is shown performing on his stadium tour on the West Coast with the crowds recreated using CGI          Viewers are also transported into his tour plane in the 1970s when he became a global superstar and multi-millionaire      Sir Elton, again using an actor, is shown performing Your Song on TV and then recording it for an album in 1970  In the 1960s the star first started performing in the Northwood Hills pub in Pinner, around the corner from where he grew up  Elton, played by Hudson Trindall, is shown performing in a school recital watched by his family in an advert inspired by events in his life (pictured, right, Elton as a child)           The heart of the advert is revealed at the end as Elton as a young boy tears the paper from the piano in front of his grandmother and mother, played by Deborah Baxter and Katie Bonna (left to right)          The child actor looks in wonder at the musical instrument with the message that gifts can inspire and change lives          The final scene shows Elton playing the same piano himself, although John Lewis admit while he learned to play with his grandmother he never received one as a Christmas giftJohn Lewis addressed speculation about the cost of this year\u0027s ad, describing reports that it had paid Sir Elton £5million as \u0027wildly inaccurate\u0027 and said the ad cost £7million with most of the money going on advertising spending.          Sir Elton said his mother Sheila (pictured together at his 50th birthday party in 1997) was an inspiration to him - but they had an eight-year feud before having a reconciliation two years before she died last DecemberIt added that Sir Elton had requested that a portion of his fee be donated to the Elton John Charitable Trust when he was first approached to be involved.  John Lewis customer director Craig Inglis said: \u0027The ad tells the story of why Elton\u0027s piano was more than just a gift and we hope to remind customers of that special moment when they\u0027ve given a gift at Christmas time that they know will be treasured forever.\u0027The retailer, which reported a 98.8 per cent profits crash for the first half of the year in September, said the ad was a \u0027crucial part\u0027 of its overall marketing campaign and \u0027one of the most effective marketing campaigns in the industry, delivering an excellent return on investment\u0027.John Lewis and Waitrose employees have been given the first opportunity to share the two minute and 20 second ad at 6am on Thursday before its launch on the store\u0027s social media channels, its website and in shops at 8am.The ad first airs on television on Thursday at 9.15pm during ITV\u0027s Dark Heart, although ITV viewers may have noticed that the theme tunes to some of the channel\u0027s shows including Coronation Street and This Morning were played solely in piano notes on Wednesday to tease the advert\u0027s premiere.Customers at the retailer\u0027s flagship Oxford Street branch can also step into a 2,000 square foot recreation of the ad production set to try on some of the costumes, listen to recordings from Elton John\u0027s 17-11-70 album and have photos taken at the piano.          The advert has been met with mixed reviews on social media with some viewers labelling it \u0027beautiful and powerful\u0027 and others asking if it is merely a promotional ad for the singer\u0027s upcoming tour John Lewis has moved away from cuddly toys this year and fans of the advert can enter a reproduction of Sir Elton\u0027s lounge now built in its Oxford Street store          The music studio where Your Song was recorded has also been lovingly rebuilt in the Oxford Street where shoppers can touch the mixing desk and play the grand piano          As part of the experience Elton\u0027s 1970s dressing room is open to the public where they can try wigs, glasses and his clothes  Classic tour T-shirts will be sold in John Lewis store but there will be no cuddly toys or other similar gifts for the 2018 advert  \u0027#fabulousfreddie!\u0027 Boy, 4, from Corrie actress Tina O\u0027Brien\u0027s drama school is revealed as child star of John Lewis advert as his proud mother shares Elton John\u0027s Instagram post about her sonThe mother of the child star of this year\u0027s John Lewis advert has spoken of her pride today after the long-awaited commercial was finally unveiled, calling her son #fabulousfreddie!Emma Henderson shared a picture of son Freddie, four, from the advert on Facebook, originally posted by Sir Elton John, with the department store\u0027s 2018 festive campaign based on his life.The mini-biopic, which cost £7million and is set to his 1970 hit Your Song, shows the Rocketman singer\u0027s career in reverse, featuring several actors in make-up and prosthetic playing him through the ages.Posting a picture of the youngster on Instagram, Sir Elton wrote: \u0027What a pleasure it was to be part of the wonderful @johnlewisandpartnersChristmas advert.\u0027Ms Henderson then shared it with the caption: \u0027When @eltonjohn posts a pic of your child\u0027s face! #fabulousfreddie @freddiesteddiego.\u0027          Freddie Henderson, four, has won rave reviews for his performance as young Elton John in the John Lewis Christmas advert and the musician posted a picture of the youngster on social media this morning which proud mother Emma Henderson shared on Facebook today, pictured          Ms Henderson, pictured with Freddie, captioned Sir Elton\u0027s post with #fabulousfreddie and said: \u0027When @eltonjohn posts a pic of your child\u0027s face!\u0027Drama school pupil Freddie was picked out from more than 1,000 hopefuls after auditioning for the advert, called The Boy and The Piano, earlier this year.

We are very, very proud. He beat more than 1,000 other boys and it is great for our small school because a lot of the big London agencies often get these roles.\u0027You don\u0027t get a bigger advert than the John Lewis Christmas ad so this could be a stepping stone to big things for Freddie\u0027.Ms Morgan added she expected the other pupils to be very excited about the advert but said Freddie had not been affected much by the exposure.She added: \u0027At his age, we try to teach them some improvisation, script work and try to get their imaginations going.\u0027We have a lot of talented children but since Freddie arrived we all said how confident, bubbly he was and how much of a spark he had.\u0027The school also confirmed Freddie would be watching tonight\u0027s first airing of the advert on ITV1 at 9.15pm with his family and it would be filming the moment to share with the public.Meanwhile O\u0027Brien, who plays Sarah in Coronation Street, added: \u0027I\u0027m so proud I could pop.\u0027   \u0027It\u0027s just one big plug for Elton!\u0027 John Lewis ides fans with \u0027not very Christmassy\u0027 festive advert as retailer is accused of \u0027selling out\u0027 by promoting singer\u0027s farewell tour and Rocketman film biopic Fans of the John Lewis Christmas advert are split today over the decision to have millionaire Sir Elton John at its heart.Critics have called the retailer\u0027s 2018 campaign a \u0027sell out\u0027 and a \u0027plug\u0027 for the star\u0027s farewell tour and his Rocketman biopic starring Taron Egerton, which is due for release next year.But others including stars James Corden and Susanna Reid have praised it with some fans claiming it is the retailer\u0027s \u0027best ever\u0027 Christmas commercial.Many said its message that one present can change a life reduced them to tears.   Some fans loved it - and saw it as a happy distraction from the Brexit chaos consuming the UK - with many crying through itThe £7million advert tells the tear-jerking story of his rise to fame and fortune from humble beginnings in Pinner, north London, where he was brought up by his mother Sheila and grandmother Rita.It ends with a four-year-old Elton - then Reg Dwight - unwrapping his first piano on Christmas Day in 1951 then cuts back to the present say showing the emotional 71-year-old playing the same instrument in front of the tree.It is followed by the slogan: \u0027Some gifts are more than just a gift\u0027 and the retailer has today started marketing pianos for £800 - the first time it has sold them for decades.Twitter went wild when it was released this morning - but it has split opinion.@mollytomkinss said: \u0027I feel truly sorry for anyone who can\u0027t understand the deeper meaning of the #JohnLewisChristmasAd this year.

Best ad since the penguins\u0027.   Elton John faces backlash for featuring his mother in John Lewis Christmas ad despite arguing with her for years           Sir Elton, pictured with his mother Sheila  after being knighted in 1998, had a series of damaging rows with her but they reconciled just before she diedSir Elton John healed the long and painful rift with his mother Sheila five months before her death last December  - but he has faced a backlash for featuring their relationship in the John Lewis Christmas advert released today.The star, 71, had been estranged from Mrs Farebrother for around nine years until May 2017 following rows over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish.Mrs Farebrother had encouraged her son to play piano from the age of three and was a constant throughout the majority of his extraordinary career.But their relationship faltered when she was in her 80s and she said two years ago her son \u0027hated\u0027 her after a series of bitter public rows.When she turned ninety she even invited an Elton John lookalike to perform because she missed him so much Despite their reconciliation last year some viewers of the John Lewis ad said it was wrong to put their sometimes rocky relationship at its heart.One fan said while watching today\u0027s advert: \u0027All I could think was: didn\u0027t Elton John famously cut his mum out of his life for years?\u0027 Another said: \u0027Nice ad for, erm... Elton John. Didn’t he refuse to speak to his mother for years? Nice that he appreciated her eventually\u0027, while one critic tweeted: \u0027Remember the time that Elton John’s mum hired an Elton John lookalike to play at her party? That didn’t make the cut into that ad\u0027.But others saw the other side and said: \u0027Such an emotional journey, so gripping, so true to life for so many people and heartfelt especially after @eltonofficial losing his Mother. Well done John Lewis this year!\u0027.Another added: \u0027I was quite moved by #JohnLewisChristmasAd. The power of music and a mother\u0027s love combined. Lovely\u0027.Mother and son\u0027s relationship appeared hit rock bottom in 2016, two years after he married Mr Furnish. Sheila had been a witness at their civil partnership in 2005.Sir Elton said: \u0027I don’t miss her. When she says things in the press, like, “I haven’t spoken to Elton since he married that f****** a****** David Furnish”. That was pretty hard to take\u0027.He added: \u0027I don’t hate my mother. I look after her but I don’t want her in my life.’But they made up fully around six months before she died last year, shortly after he was hospitalised for 12 days, including two nights in intensive care, after picking up a serious infection while touring South America.In May 2017 he confirmed they were close again after he shared a throwback picture on Twitter to celebrate reconnecting with Mrs Farebrother on America\u0027s Mother\u0027s Day with the message: \u0027So happy we are back in touch. Love, Elton.\u0027Mother and son fell out in 2008 after she allegedly refused his request not to talk to two of their oldest friends.          Sheila and Elton at the height of his fame in 1976 - she has been credited for being a driving force behind his career          1947: Elton John is born Reginald Dwight on March 25 to father Stanley and mother Sheila. As he grew up his father was largely absent and his mum encouraged him to play the piano from the age of three.His parents orce and Sheila remarries his stepfather John, and the couple encourage him to write songs and get him a job as a pub pianist age 15. She remained a strong and constant support during his long career. 2008: Mother and son fall out after a row over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish\u0027s influence on his career2015: Mrs Farebrother said that her son \u0027hated\u0027 her and gets an an Elton John impersonator at her 90th birthday party. He then sends a bunch of white orchids - his first contact for seven years. May 2017: He posts a US mother\u0027s day message saying he is \u0027happy they\u0027re in touch\u0027 - confirming they had reconciled their differences.December 4, 2017: Sheila Farebrother dies aged 92.                                                    This was further inflamed when she claimed that Elton never told her she had become a grandmother when boys Elijah and Zachary were born.In 2015 she told the Daily Mail that her son had called out of the blue and ordered her to cut off all contact with Bob Halley - Sir Elton\u0027s driver turned personal assistant, who he had fired after more than 30 years of service - and John Reid, with whom he had fallen out.Mrs Farebrother, who lived in a bungalow on the South Coast, said: \u0027I told him: \u0027I\u0027m not about to do that and drop them. Bob is like a son to me. He has always been marvellous to me and he lives nearby and keeps an eye on me\u0027.\u0027She said Sir Elton flew into an expletive-filled rage, adding: \u0027To my utter amazement, he told me he hated me.\u0027And he banged the phone down. Imagine! To me, his mother!\u0027She is said to have told him during the row: \u0027I said to him, And you think more of that f***ing thing you married than your own mother.\u0027During that period, however, it is understood Sir Elton continued to support Sheila financially and to provide a roof over her head, despite all that has passed between them.He is also said to have paid £30,00 for her double hip replacement.At one point she filled the void left by her son with a tribute act to the pop star.Sheila Farebrother hired him to provide the entertainment at her 90th birthday in March 2015 and would send emails to Mr Bacon, who himself described their link as \u0027quite surreal\u0027.Prompted by the milestone birthday, Sir Elton got in touch with his mother for the first time in seven years, sending her white orchids.They then continued to work on their relationship until their reconciliation was properly confirmed by Sir Elton in May 2017.The star last saw her a week before she died.When it was announced on December 4 last year he said he was in \u0027complete shock\u0027.He also posted a photograph of them together in happier times and wrote on Instagram: \u0027So sad to say that my mother passed away this morning. I only saw her last Monday and I am in shock. Travel safe Mum. Thank-you for everything. I will miss you so much. Love, Elton\u0027.The singer says he has been spurred on to shower his sons with affection because he received none from his own father.Elton took a swipe at his late father Stanley Dwight while giving a speech in which he said a lack of love had led him to drink and drugs.He said recently: \u0027I never stop telling them I love them, and they never stop telling me they love me\u0027.          Elton John, then 24, at home with his mother Theresa and stepfather Fred in 1971, and the couple were his rock for many years but his own father Stanley was largely absent      John Lewis\u0027 2017 Christmas advert has left viewers in tears over a mischievous and flatulent monster called Moz and  his relationship with a seven-year-old soulmate - with fans comparing it to Disney\u0027s much-loved Monsters Inc.The giant furry monster with a bulbous nose, wonky teeth and a love of snoring, jumps out from under the bed every night to play with companion Joe in a festive tale making many  laugh and cry.The little boy, aged 7, who is played by young twin brothers from London named Ethan and Tobias, is initially frightened after seeing a pair of enormous eyes peering from the dark under his bed.But the two unlikely friends are shown sharing games, playing piggyback and Scalextric in his bedroom – all without mum, dad, or older sister finding out.Moz then leaves his friend as he realises the little boy needs to grow up without him and wraps a farewell gift for him under the Christmas tree - a nightlight to help him sleep.Elbow performed The Beatles\u0027 Abbey Road masterpiece Golden Slumbers as the soundtrack.2016 Last year\u0027s star was Buster the Boxer and his trampoline antics.John Lewis said the advert where the dog, played by five-year-old Biff, beats a young girl to her new toy is their attempt to cheer up Britain after a \u0027tough year\u0027.The advert told the story of a little girl called Bridget who loves to jump.Set to a cover version of \u0027One Day I\u0027ll Fly Away\u0027, her mother and father buy her a trampoline, toiling while she sleeps to build it before hiding it in the garden to surprise her with on Christmas Day. As the snow falls an array of animals start using it as the Boxer watches forlornly through the window.The next morning Bridget sprints out to use it for the first time but her joy turns to shock as cheeky Buster has the last laugh and uses her new toy  before her.2015A lonely Man on the Moon is shown to viewers sitting by himself on a bench, completely unaware that he is being observed by the youngster back down on EarthThe elderly man, played by a 77-year-old French actor called Jean, gazes up wistfully towards the Earth, as the Oasis song Half The World Away, performed by 19-year-old Norwegian singer Aurora plays mournfully in the background.She tries desperately to send him a message but all her efforts fail, while he remains unaware that anyone cares about him and sits alone on a bench, wistfully staring up at the Earth.Eventually, on Christmas morning, a present arrives from the sky, carried by party balloons, and the old man unwraps it to reveal a vintage telescope.He uses it to spot Lily and, realising that someone cares about him, his eyes fill with tears.2014John Lewis hoped the bond between a boy and a penguin would capture the public\u0027s imagination.The two-minute festive commercial told the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty.The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.The soundtrack was John Lennon\u0027s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.2013The £7million Disney-inspired advert told the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend, a bear, doesn\u0027t miss Christmas for once.The commercial features the tale of two good friends, a bear and a hare, who are sad at the thought of being separated for Christmas.The tale opens as winter is starting to draw in and the fun and excitement of preparing for Christmas begins.As the first snowflake falls and lands on the bear\u0027s nose, the hare starts to feel sad because he realises his friend will soon go off to hibernate, so – as usual - missing Christmas.While the bear is keen to join in, eventually he finds he cannot hold off his winter sleep any longer and disappears into his cave.Viewers see the bear fast asleep while all the other woodland creatures become excited about the big day to come.However, the hare is missing his friend and finds it increasingly difficult to join in the preparations until the moment he has a great idea for a very special present.He disappears off in to the wilderness to return with the gift – an alarm clock – which wakes the bear just in time to gather around a beautifully decorated tree to celebrate with all his friends.2012The Christmas ad, called The Journey, shows the extraordinary lengths to which some will go in their search for a gift for someone they love.The 90-second commercial opens in a family\u0027s snow-covered garden, with children happily making a snowman and snowwoman.When the snowman mysteriously disappears the next morning, the viewer is transported to a magical world, following him on an epic journey across river, mountain, road and city.The motive for the snowman\u0027s secret journey isn\u0027t revealed until the last scene, when he returns on Christmas morning with gifts for his wife.Newcomer Gabrielle Aplin sings The Power Of Love, the 1984 hit from Frankie Goes To Hollywood, as the soundtrack. 2011In 2011, the John Lewis advert showed a young boy so desperately excited about Christmas that he couldn\u0027t wait to give presents to his parents.It was accompanied by a cover of The Smiths\u0027 Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\u0027.2010And the 2010 offering saw iniduals choosing and wrapping their presents in the lead up to the big day, as Ellie Goulding sings a cover of Elton John\u0027s Your Song.Various people furtively hide the presents they\u0027ve carefully chosen: parents sneak a rocking horse upstairs while their children\u0027s backs are turned a mechanic struggles to wrap a spotted teapot and a small boy braves the snow in his dressing gown to hang a stocking outside his dog\u0027s kennel.2009This was the first of the store\u0027s Christmas campaigns created by advertising agency Adam \u0026amp Eve, now adam\u0026ampeveDDB, and the first to feature a musical cover by a current artist, on this occasion a Taken By Trees version of Sweet Child O\u0027 Mine by Guns N\u0027 Roses.The ad shows children opening gifts for adults including a laptop, coffee machine and handbag, followed by the tagline: \u0027Remember how Christmas used to feel? Give someone that feeling.\u00272008Culminating in the tagline: \u0027If you know the person, you\u0027ll find the present,\u0027 it shows a succession of characters followed by a matching gift.The soundtrack is a cover of The Beatles\u0027 From Me To You recorded for the campaign, with vocals by Matt Spinner, a member of the John Lewis IT department and its music society.2007The ad shows a group of people stacking a pile of potential gifts including a desktop lamp, a computer and a leather satchel in an empty room. The finished product ends up creating a shadow that looks like a woman walking her dog through the snow, accompanied by the tagline: \u0027Whoever you\u0027re looking for this Christmas.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Bug eyed puss called Wilfred internet star","story":"    Michael Rapaport at the \u0027White Famous\u0027 TV show premiere in LA, his cat video went viralThe strange looking feline sits completely still staring at the comedian who starred in Prison Break and Friends.The unflinching and lack of blinking seems to spook the actor who calls for his mother in his thick Manhattan accent. He says: \u0027Ma!

An emotional Sir Elton John is the star of the 2018 John Lewis Christmas advert, which tells the uplifting and poignant story of his rise to superstardom sparked with the gift of music          Elton, then Reg Dwight from Pinner, tears the paper away to reveal a beautiful piano that would inspire him to play  In the 1960s the star first started performing in the Northwood Hills pub in Pinner, around the corner from where he grew up          Actor Oliver Marshall wearing prosthetics and original clothes is shown performing on his stadium tour on the West Coast with the crowds recreated using CGI          Viewers are also transported into his tour plane in the 1970s when he became a global superstar and multi-millionaire          The finale shows Sir Elton playing the same piano and ends with the message: \u0027Some gifts are more than just a gift\u0027But on her 90th birthday he sent Sheila a large bouquet of white orchids for her milestone birthday and also shelled out £30,000 for Sheila to undergo a double hip replacement.When she died two years later he spoke of his grief - but happiness that they had become close again.In September rumours emerged that Sir Elton had agreed to take part - but John Lewis has denied he was paid the £5million fee being mooted. They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027His husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said: \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously. I think, you know, emotionally he is thinking about the journey he’s been on as an artist, and that moment, you know, when music came into his life at a very young age when he was encouraged by his mother and his grandmother with his piano\u0027.The Boy \u0026amp The Piano was released online at 8am this morning before being shown on ITV at 9.15pm tonight.The advert coincides with the start of ticket sales Sir Elton worldwide farewell tour and next year Taron Egerton will play him in Rocketman, the biopic film being made about the star, with his blessing, due for release next year.John Lewis says the movie and tour is unrelated to their choice of star and advert, which was filmed over the summer."},{"url":null,"title":"Pregnant womans relaxing bath brought abrupt end pooch dives in","story":"The cute dog peeked his head over the top of the bath tub (left) before jumping in with his owner Connie (right)Puppy love!

But she released a statement saying she was not involved  According to the LAPD, the incident occurred near the 10,000 block of Santa Monica Blvd. Officers took a police report, and Avenatti was arrested at 2.05pm at the same address Wednesday.He has now been booked and charged with 273.5APC intimate partner violence.\u0027It was an altercation between him and a victim,\u0027 the LAPD spokesman said, but refused to confirm the identity of the woman or details of the alleged violence.\u0027We don\u0027t give those kind of details out because it\u0027s domestic violence.

She added: ‘Customers feel their loyalty has been taken for granted.’ Closures hit rural communities especially hard, with those on low incomes and the elderly most likely to suffer.Tory MP Simon Clarke, a member of the Treasury committee, which is investigating the diminishing accessibility of financial services, said: ‘Banks are depriving people of essential services.‘With no bank manager on hand vulnerable people are left without any guidance on financial matters.’Parliamentary records show there were 20,583 branches in 1988, but the consumer group’s analysis shows that there are just 7,586 today.Sparsely-populated parts of Scotland account for the top 70 communities farthest from a bank.Areas where recent closures have led to towns or villages without a single branch include Lymm in Cheshire, Broseley in Shropshire, Fishguard in Pembrokeshire and Sturminster Newton in Dorset.While banks argue that one of the country’s 11,500 Post Office branches can plug the gap, there are many crucial banking services they do not offer.These include opening or closing accounts, transferring money between accounts, making a complaint about the bank and requesting a replacement debit card.Banks also require customers to call into a branch for matters such as anti-fraud checks or to discuss legal documents such as lasting power of attorney.Almost half of those surveyed by Which? said they were unlikely to use a Post Office for banking services, questioning the level of staff expertise in financial services and complaining about long queues.Martin Kearsley, banking services director at the Post Office, said: ‘We are uniquely placed to bring vital services to local communities right across the country. It’s a responsibility that we take very seriously.’      "},{"url":null,"title":"El Chapo ordered bribes paid military Interpol dollars says informant","story":"    In this courtroom sketch Joaquin El Chapo Guzman, center, sits next to his defense attorney Eduardo Balarezo, left, for opening statements in Brooklyn on Tuesday          Guzman (above in 2016 arrest) is accused of smuggling more than 155 tons of cocaine into the United States over 25 years and faces life in prison if found guilty\u0027I was going to import cocaine from Colombia through the state of Guerrero... and El Chapo told me \u0027Go and meet General Toledano, he\u0027s my friend, and give him $100,000 from me,\u0027\u0027 Zambada said, wearing a blue prison suit with an orange shirt.Guzman, wearing a dark suit and tie, listened attentively to the testimony of his former ally.Zambada told the court that as the head of the organization\u0027s operations in the capital city, he personally paid bribes to the attorney general\u0027s office, the federal highway police that also operates bridges and airports, federal, state and local police forces, and \u0027Interpol, as well.\u0027\u0027The bribes for officials in Mexico City were about $300,000 per month,\u0027 the 57-year-old said.

Sure, I could tell that his tendency to puff a Fantastic Four script as “a pulse-pounding pastiche of philosophical profundity” was over the top. (The “p” in “philosophical” wasn’t a proper alliteration, for a start.) But the claim of profundity was well founded, wasn’t it? At the climax of the aforementioned Fantastic Four story, a crazed ex-Nazi underling of the dictator Doctor Doom aims a flamethrower at a dissident in a hall full of looted paintings. “My life is of little consequence,” pleads the dissident, “but this art – it is irreplaceable!” “Art? What do I care for art??” yells the ex-Nazi, just before being killed by Doctor Doom, who, it turns out, values art over human life. My nine-year-old brain may not have contained the term “ideological complexity”, but here it was.When asked to name his favourite authors, Lee always included Shakespeare. He certainly had fun injecting faux-Shakespearean flavour into his story titles: “If This Be Doomsday”, “If The Past Be Not Dead … ”, “Lest Tyranny Triumph …!” and hundreds more, festooned with ellipses and exclamation marks. (The Bard’s own “Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave … ” was a must for Spider-Man.) He was, as he once said, “really big into the rhythm of words … The way the words string together impresses the hell out of me.” He also loved the phraseology of the Bible. By presenting young readers with high-flown vocabulary and classical allusions beyond their grasp, he made his pulp fictions seem more grown-up than they really were.Lee could write in many registers. He pioneered superhero comics’ engagement with what was going on in the real world, whereas the comics published by Marvel’s arch-rival DC were typically set in imaginary places such as Gotham City and Smallville where nobody was politicised, homeless, oppressed or troubled. In sharp contrast to the inhuman vacuity of Superman, Lee’s superheroes were plagued by anxieties, ambivalence and a messy interface with an imperfect world. In mid-60s Marvel comics, not only did Vietnam exist, but American soldiers got blinded there and students on Spider-Man’s campus protested against the war. The X-Men, always needing to hide their mutant nature from a general public fiercely prejudiced against them, embodied a neat antisemitism metaphor (both Lee and his co-creator Jack Kirby were Jewish). Typical of Lee’s socially progressive ethos was his inclusion of black characters as articulate, much-valued members of communities, workplaces and – eventually, with the advent of Black Panther in 1966 – the superhero pantheon.By the 1970s, as comics readers grew older and more sophisticated, Lee handed over the scripting duties to a new generation, who brought increasing maturity, pretension, cynicism and ultraviolence to the storylines. If Lee felt any unease about this, he never showed it. Latterly excused from any literary duties, he relished his role as the company’s PR dynamo, lecturing at colleges and pitching ideas to Hollywood. A smooth negotiator, he managed to get very rich from the Marvel corporation while Kirby – who invented or co-invented some of the characters that currently rule our multiplexes – was apparently overlooked.I’m aware of all that sad, ignoble stuff, but still I admire Lee and feel a debt of gratitude to him. He once confessed to a thwarted hankering to write the great American novel, but, fortunately for all of us, he settled for creating a cosmology of modern myths – grand, vibrant, resonant, big enough to be repurposed decade after decade to fit in with the stories we need to tell ourselves. He was touched by a kind of goofy genius, and his imagination was, in his heyday, astonishingly fertile and bold. He saw nothing wrong with tackling the profoundest tragedies and challenges of one’s era through a prism of escapist entertainment. In this, he was instinctively closer to Shakespeare than to the serious novelists of the late 20th century, many of whose elegantly crafted, painfully self-important books, garlanded with prestige at the time, are already forgotten •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fe087d5c9904e687b9e2c2a51a579cf52960741/191_196_4844_2906/master/4844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41c66be414731ba9f2cf8b99c28f0a7d","title":"books that made me sheila heti","story":"The Canadian author on miracles, Kafka’s Metamorphosis and the life-changing philosophy of Andy WarholThe book I am currently readingI’m rereading Babbitt by Sinclair Lewis, because I wanted to experience an early version of the soulless, materialist, striving and pompous American. I’m also reading In the Flow by Boris Groys, a fascinating book of essays about contemporary art.The book that changed my life Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. I read it when I was 15 and it made me realise that you could do anything you wanted in literature – that there were absolutely no rules. It made writing seem like a true place of freedom. Not a wastrel freedom, but a meaningful freedom.The book I wish I’d writtenAny of the books of the New Testament, because I would like to have seen the miracles.The book that had the greatest influence on me A book of plays by Harold Pinter made a strong impression on me when I was 17 or 18: the heightened tension between the characters, the formality and humour of the sentences, how absurd, simple and mysterious the story was. For a long time, I couldn’t get his voice out of my head and it was impossible to find my own voice.The book I think is most underratedOf the books I’ve read recently, A House in Norway by Vigdis Hjorth seems to be seriously underrated – in English, at least. Unfortunately, I liked it so much that I didn’t share it with anyone else. I wanted to feel like it was mine. It’s about an artist’s attempt to make her art serve as politics, and her failure. It’s also about a woman alone. I love anything – books, movies, stories – about a woman alone.The last book that made me cryWhen my father was 12 he wrote an autobiography for school. He died this autumn, and a cousin pulled out a bound, photocopied version of it at dinner recently. I opened it and his love of life – his optimism and sweetness and innocence and joy – were all there in the first sentence I read, and I began to cry at the table.The last book that made me laughI think of laughter as social communication, and I’m usually alone when I’m reading. When people laugh while reading it’s often just showing off, a way of boasting about what a good time they’re having without you. Plus, even when a book is funny, like Linday Wong’s dark and fascinating memoir, The Woo-Woo, the humour tends to be so mixed up with other things that my reaction wouldn’t be laughter.The book that changed my mindThe Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again) made me see how the depressing ugliness and pettiness of one’s own time can be beautiful and grand, if looked at in the right way. His paintings have that effect, too. I felt very distant from today’s culture before I read this book in 2006, and it brought me much closer to it. More recently, Malcolm Harris’s excellent non-fiction work Kids These Days made me understand – and pity – millennials. I hadn’t thought about their social media obsession as a form of labour.The book I couldn’t finishI tend not to finish books. I often read to get closer to an author, to know them, and once I feel like I do know them, I tend to stop. I’m trying to correct this bad habit, because though you can love an author without finishing the book, you can’t love the book. The last books I loved that I stopped reading for no good reason were Louis-Ferdinand Celine’s Death on the Installment Plan, Frederick Douglass’s Autobiographies, and Allan Bloom’s The Closing of the American Mind.The book I’m most ashamed not to have readI don’t feel ashamed about not having read books, mostly because I think I will eventually read them. Moby-Dick, Invisible Man: it’s not only my fault! Books choose you. It has to be mutual. I sometimes open and begin them, but they seem to say “not now”, so I return them to my shelves, where they seem happy. I don’t believe in forcing it.My earliest reading memoryI remember reading Madeleine L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time on a plane, and feeling completely dizzy to be reading a book while high up in the clouds. It was the mixed pleasure of being far from home and the earth, and in a vivid new world in my imagination, and the magic of being surrounded by people –but still alone. I’ll never forget it.My reading guilty pleasureIn 1967, the great Hollywood costume designer Edith Head published a style manual for women called How to Dress for Success. Although this book is outdated in many ways, it’s still delightful, insightful, rigorous and brilliant, and I get a secret thrill when reading it.The book I give as a giftThe novel Two Serious Ladies by Jane Bowles. Her sentences are so surprising, the plot is like something from a dream, and her mind is deeply unfathomable, precise, funny, earnest and otherworldly. It feels like giving someone an exotic fruit.The book I’d most like to be remembered forProbably my first book, a collection of stories called The Middle Stories. I wrote it in my early 20s when writing was still a completely pure thing for me. I felt utterly and deeply alone with the book, in a way that has never been as possible since. The black hole-like aloneness in that book is valuable, I think, so I would like it to last through time.• Sheila Heti’s Motherhood (Harvill Secker) is shortlisted for the Scotiabank Giller prize.

Then people were rounded up and shotOn 7 November 1918, a critic and journalist called Kurt Eisner, with long grey hair, a wild beard and pince-nez, led a victory parade through the streets of Munich, calling for revolution. Crowds flocked, among them the many disbanded soldiers returning from the war. Eisner dreamed of a free and independent Bavaria, run by councils of writers and workers in which artists would elevate and educate the masses and there would never again be war. He would be prime minister. It could not, indeed did not, last. But for three chaotic weeks, ungoverned Munich was in perpetual carnival mood, with women sitting outside on their porches in the sunshine and prophets, “hypnotists, and those who had been hypnotised” preaching anarchy and happiness. Thomas Mann’s son Klaus, 13 at the time, saw himself as “an animal feeling the approach of an earthquake”.In his extremely enjoyable Summer Before the Dark, published in 2016, Volker Weidermann took a moment, a group of people and a place – Ostend in 1936 with Stefan Zweig and Joseph Roth – and used it to paint a portrait of Europe as it was drawn inexorably towards war. He uses the same highly effective method in Dreamers, putting together a picture of the chaotic aftermath of the first world war when it was just possible to believe that everything could be different. Once again, he builds his narrative around a cast of remarkable characters, some familiar, others known only to scholars of German history.Three weeks after his march through Munich, Eisner’s dream unravelled. Opposition, much of it raucous and agitated, built up from both the right and the left. On his way to deliver his resignation speech to parliament, he was shot dead by an assassin who later explained that he acted to save the Fatherland from a Jew, a Bolshevik and a traitor. The weeks that followed were marked by street fights, recriminations and revenge killings, but they brought to the fore another dreamer – the pacifist, Marxist playwright and poet Ernst Toller.Having moved as president into the palace hastily vacated by the Bavarian royal family, and insisting on taking only a bathroom as his office, Toller called on Bavaria’s workers to struggle, but without violence, against capitalism. The new world as he saw it was to be a sheet of white paper on which everything was newly imagined. There would be schools but no desks, so that children could move around freely, journalists would be unshackled from their profiteering newspaper proprietors and artists would set up their own councils. But, as Weidermann writes, the sheet of paper was all too soon “covered with scrawls of hate and panic, accusations, mockery, violence”. A putsch bringing the communists to power was quickly followed by the arrival of the anti-communist White army. The revolutionary state collapsed. The red flags, sashes and banners that had filled the streets disappeared. People were rounded up and quickly shot, without being given a chance to defend themselves. Toller, astonishingly, survived, having been president for just six days, but many of his fellow dreamers did not. In 1939, after learning that his brother and sister had been sent to concentration camps, he killed himself.Thomas Mann, at work on The Magic Mountain, was one of the writers present in Munich in this revolutionary autumn of 1918. A little uncertain about his own feelings towards the rebels, by the time the “good looking” south German soldiers marched in, wearing their steel helmets, he professed relief at the crushing of Bolshevism and “this incendiary mix of Jewish intellectual radicalism and Slavic fanatical Christianity”.Other observers quoted by Weidermann include Claus von Stauffenberg, then a small boy and later to be one of the plotters executed after the attempt on Hitler’s life, and Rainer Maria Rilke, who confessed to feeling “a certain ... joyous confidence” at the thought of the new republic. Ben Hecht, the American screenwriter and novelists, and the diarist Viktor Klemperer were also in the city, taking notes on what was happening Hecht cabled home to Chicago: “The people were free. The sun of liberty was shining on them.” And in Munich at the time was Hitler himself, then a lance corporal, “an unobtrusive subordinate” guarding a camp of Russian prisoners of war. These heady days, the German historian Thomas Weber has suggested, may have been the moment in which Hitler became a “leader in the making”. Rudolph Hess, later his deputy, was nearby but reassured his parents: “Munich is celebrating and going for walks ... Otherwise, nothing is happening”.Like the shortlived similar experiment in Hungary, where the foreign minister Béla Kun oversaw a 133-day Republic of Councils, Munich’s rebellion barely had a present, let alone any sort of future. It was doomed from the start, as Weidermann notes, by a combination of German military might and a general spirit of subservience. “Love,” he writes, “was the dream, hate was the result.” He is a subtle storyteller, and one of his great skills is the way in which he pins down celebrated people at specific moments and then demonstrates how their reactions shaped their subsequent lives. He brings to life long forgotten and seemingly insignificant and quirky episodes in history, and in so doing shows how unpredictably and randomly it unfolds, and how it is full of unlikely heroes who occupy the stage for a few moments, only to leave it for ever. • Dreamers: When the Writers Took Power, Germany 1918 by Volker Weidermann \u0026amp Ruth Martin (Pushkin, £16.99).

His most famous was in 2011, when he derided Oprah’s book club following her selection of his novel The Corrections – after which Oprah disinvited Franzen from appearing on her show.This week Franzen published a new book of essays, The End of the End of the Earth.Franzen’s 10 rules, published on Lithub, include: “You have to love before you can be relentless”, “you are more sitting still than chasing after”, “It’s doubtful that anyone with an Internet connection at his workplace is writing good fiction”, and one that has particularly drawn the ire of library lovers: “When information becomes free and universally accessible, voluminous research for a novel is devalued along with it.”New York Times best-selling author Chuck Wendig tweeted his own writing rules, parodying Franzen in a thread that quickly went viral, inspiring other writers to issue their own mock advice.Jodi Picoult tweeted that she was “delighted” to announce that she had broken every one of Franzen’s writing rules, stating later that while she wasn’t bashing Franzen, “his rules don’t work for me”.Best-selling historical romance writer Tessa Dare re-tweeted the list, commenting, “In which Jonathan Franzen reveals himself to be that guy who mentions Ayn Rand in his tinder profile”, and continued: “It is evident that writing with no Internet connection nearby makes you 1,000,000 times more likely to lose your work, good or not.”Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt also published his own list of seven rules.He apologised for the tweet in a subsequent one:Following the publication of his writing tips, “Jonathan Franzen” trended in top 10 Twitter lists around the world, coming in at No 4 in America and No 7 in New Zealand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fc6430a02e370e941261a965a1494d93a23c026/1046_770_1898_1139/master/1898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50394b0a1fef99894f2f1c2cd39dcda6","title":"uk bank urged justify staggering level branch closures which survey","story":"Britain’s leading consumer group has called on banks to justify nearly 13,000 bank branch closures that have left millions of people struggling to access vital financial services across the UK.Figures compiled by the consumer charity Which? show that the UK has lost nearly two-thirds of its bank and building society branches over the past 30 years, from 20,583 in 1988 to 7,586 today.Thinly-populated areas of Scotland account for 70 of the communities farthest from a branch, though Which? said the south-west and east of England had been “disproportionately affected” given the size of regional populations.Among the towns and villages now lacking a single bank branch are Lymm in Cheshire, Sturminster Newton in Dorset, Fishguard in Pembrokeshire and Broseley in Shropshire.Ceri Stanaway, money editor for Which?, said: “The true scale of bank branch closures in recent decades is staggering and has left millions of people struggling to access the vital financial services and cash that they need.“For many there is simply no substitute for a dedicated branch and the wide range of services it offers, and many customers now face having to travel long distances if they are to avoid financial exclusion.”Banks including RBS, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds have significantly reduced their bank branch footprint in recent years in an effort to cut costs amid a digital banking push. Those lenders have turned to the Post Office to offset closures, with postmasters across 11,547 sites offering basic transaction services in their stead.Post Office sites are also restricted in the services they can offer, with customers unable to open or close accounts, transfer money between accounts, request a debit card replacement or make a complaint about their bank.Stanaway said: “We want to see banks properly justifying the reasons for closure and taking into account their customers’ needs before shutting their doors – and their customers out.”The Post Office said in a statement that it took its responsibility “very seriously” and was “uniquely placed to bring vital services to local communities right across the country”.But Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the Post Office should be “doing more, to both improve its small business banking offer and make more firms aware of it”.He added that bank branches were still “vital” to small business owners in areas where internet services were still lagging, or whose customers preferred to pay cash.“Bank branch closures damage high street footfall, restrict cashflow in local economies and force business owners to waste time travelling to and from their next nearest branch, which could be miles away.“Yes, small business owners need to consider alternative ways to bank, but the sheer pace of branch closures is frightening. Firms need time to adjust.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29574a5fc4538544de79febe40a365392267baf5/0_83_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=150a07c11905bf8639094903df9f64fe","title":"i felt like i had seen the future capturing japan megacities tokyo shanghai","story":"Architectural photographer Cody Ellingham takes to the streets of Tokyo and Shanghai to reveal secrets old and newWith his moody night-time shots of urban environments, New Zealand-born photographer Cody Ellingham tries to tap into the current of a city, to travel forward into its future or retreat into the past.Ellingham, a creative based in Tokyo, came to photography while travelling through northern Japan shortly after it was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Volunteering in the town of Otsuchi-Cho in Iwate, he was moved to capture on camera the foundations of buildings and towns that had been exposed in the disaster and streets that no longer existed.

The Chequers plan, as it was known, was pronounced dead by the EU two months later in Salzburg. Mrs May was then sent back to rework her proposals, a humiliation in the eyes of her party that she has not lived down. Since then, the prime minister has been viewed with condescension, even contempt, by her own MPs. It has often appeared that Mrs May leads a party that has taken leave of its senses. This week, Mrs May produced a plan, acceptable to continental capitals, for the two-year transition period when Britain leaves the EU. This has finally tipped large sections of the Tory party over the edge.Two cabinet ministers have resigned as well as a raft of junior ones. MPs from the hardline European Research Group are busy tweeting pictures of letters demanding that Mrs May goes. Her difficulty is that few people seem to be impressed by her or her Brexit plan: not the left of her party (who consider her proposals to be an inferior position to the status quo) nor its right (who reject it for falling short of their fantasy). Over three hours at the dispatch box this morning, it became obvious that the deal Mrs May struck with the EU is dead. Her platform would be one that any challenger would run against. Mrs May finds no support from the opposition benches or from the Democratic Unionist party.The end is nigh for this phase of British politics. Mrs May might survive a leadership challenge to limp on. Her plan certainly will not. In facing down rebels, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act constrains Mrs May. She can no longer turn votes into issues of confidence that, if lost, would trigger an election. She cannot just go on losing votes. MPs will eventually have to be allowed to vote on alternatives, which might include whether to have a softer – or a harder – Brexit deal than Mrs May has secured whether a general election ought to be held and even whether or not to endorse a second referendum. To stave off such thoughts, Mrs May says the only other option is for Britain to “leave with no deal”. If politicians ought to have learned anything since 2016 it surely must be that the country is not in a mood to be scared into submission.This points to a feature not a bug in Brexit: untamed nationalism is a powerfully destructive force. A decade ago, the largely sublimated Euroscepticism of the Conservative party began to break through. The veteran Europhile grandee Ken Clarke began featuring as the most rebellious Tory MP. This has led to fantasy. Brexiters, wrongly, have argued that leaving Europe is a way to restore Britain’s greatness. The nationalist vote against the EU, say leavers, was not to shrink the UK. Rather, they claim, Brexit Britain ought to play a role in the world independent of Europe, not lost within it. As Mrs May put it, Britain voted “to leave the European Union and embrace the world ... to build a truly global Britain”. This is poppycock. The EU is a force multiplier for this country. In leaving, Britain will almost certainly be a diminished and angrier place.With just four months to Brexit this is not the time for a protracted Conservative leadership contest. What prevents a speedy contest is that there is no consensus over a post-May Brexit strategy. A ided party cannot guide this nation out of the EU. It is delusional to think leaving Europe will immediately boost the economy. The Tories risk repelling voters living in Britain’s most dynamic regions. The Tories had largely contained their European passions in informal factions. The problem is that Euroscepticism is an ideology rooted in abstract ideas, not in experience. Being in Europe encouraged trust, reciprocity and good behaviour. Falling out risks the opposite. The Conservative party has stayed intact for almost the whole of the past century, imbibing the crucial lesson of Labour’s traumatic experience in the 1980s – that any splinter party would disappear in the remorseless logic of the electoral system. Parties do experience rifts. But Brexit is turning these into an existential fight for the soul of the Tory party, with Britain as collateral damage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a533ea1d6c1d2d4e3d7adbcb56b92dc567c01114/0_0_2076_1246/master/2076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c766bac80624db9963359885c7927113","title":"theresa may brexit running out of road","story":"Her face was as impossible to read as ever. Theresa May betrayed so little of her emotions as she emerged from Downing Street to unveil her Brexit deal on Wednesday night that with the sound off, you wouldn’t have known if she was resigning or declaring peace in our time.But perhaps she didn’t quite know herself. Only minutes earlier, her Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, had told the Conservative chief whip that he would be quitting, although his resignation was only formally accepted the next morning. She must have known this fragile truce couldn’t hold, that cabinet ministers who had lost the fight inside the room were now taking it outside. This was a prime minister with power slipping through her fingers.Yet even in what may be her last days in office, May still has her uniquely stultifying ability to drain a moment of its drama. Ministers sometimes complain that she chairs cabinet meetings, rather than leading them that her own views remain oddly opaque. There was a flavour of exactly that detachment when she came to parliament on Thursday morning. With ministers dropping like flies, she didn’t even try to pretend this was the deal anybody had wanted, although it does at least tick the boxes of ending freedom of movement and minimising economic disruption. Rather, she wanted the nation to know that she had done her best in trying circumstances, and if some felt it wasn’t good enough then that was regrettable but – well, there it was. The overall air was of a postwoman plodding through a blizzard, just trying to deliver what the people had ordered, as if her own feelings barely mattered. And perhaps, in a way, they don’t.Years ago, when May first started being seriously discussed as a future leader, Europe was the one issue on which even her closest political allies couldn’t be sure where she stood. The best they could offer was that she didn’t seem terribly interested. (There is a ring of truth to former aide Nick Timothy’s charge that deep down she never believed Brexit could work, although he is wrong to suggest that if only she had believed harder in fairies everything would have worked out if anything, she merely comes across as rather more in touch with reality than he was.)But whatever she feels deep down, it is not the May way to emote, any more than it is to inspire. She prevails by grinding people down, wearing them out, pointing out the lack of a better alternative it’s how she became leader in the first place, how she has survived despite her party’s misgivings, and evidently how she will now seek to stave off the attempted leadership challenge now under way. This time she could hardly get away with pretending that nothing had changed, but the message was that nothing will be changing the deal is the deal. Her best hope is to persuade her party that anything is better than the risk of accidentally installing Jacob Rees-Mogg in Downing Street, before somehow trying to sell her unloved deal to the nation on the grounds that at least this way everyone will know where they stand and Brexit will be over. The British people, she insisted at an almost unnaturally calm press conference, just want her to “get on with it”. Perhaps she is banking on what the academic Rob Ford calls “Brexhaustion”, or the fact that for every man or woman glued to every twist and turn there is probably one who barely cares now how this thing ends, just so long as it ends.Yet that end now looks a very long way off indeed. There is something almost wickedly disingenuous about continuing to pretend, at this moment of great national jeopardy, that with the right person in charge we could swiftly extract a deal offering exactly the same advantages as EU membership but with none of the tiresome obligations. It is no more credible that Jeremy Corbyn, a man who can barely get through a TV interview over Brexit without contradicting his own party’s policy, could pull this mythical sword from the stone than that Boris Johnson or Rees-Mogg could.If negotiations have truly reached a stalemate, then stopping the clock on article 50 and throwing the ball back to the people in a second referendum arguably seems the fairest way forward. Having never personally been convinced of the case for a people’s vote, nonetheless I’d bite your arm off for one if it’s a choice of that or crashing out without a deal, a scenario in which the health secretary apparently cannot guarantee that lives would not be lost. The more real the prospect of no deal becomes, the more pressing the case for seeking consent, no matter how resistant both May and Corbyn are to the idea.But let’s not pretend that the outcome of a second referendum would necessarily be any more welcome than the last one, that the losing side would be any more reconciled to defeat, or that we wouldn’t spend the next 10 years arguing about who lied and cheated. And before we get to any of that, the last act of the Tory psychodrama must first play itself out. May is not just running out of road on Brexit. Relations with the DUP, which won’t back her deal, have descended into the deep freeze amid mutterings of private promises betrayed. She surely can’t rely on their votes now to drive through whatever tattered fragments of her domestic policy are left.Desperation to keep the Brexit show on the road is now bending the rest of government out of shape, with rumours of policy and spending decisions being twisted to keep restless ministers on board. She could see off the Rees-Mogg charge but survive only as a puppet leader, her strings jerked by any Brexiter willing to stay in cabinet – a deal Michael Gove seems to have initially offered her. It seems unlikely that any domestic legacy of her own could be salvaged from such wreckage.But if her premiership has been sorely lacking in imagination at times, by taking the referendum result so literally she has at least provided a moment of dreadful clarity about the consequences. Tory Brexiters demanded the impossible. Well, now they have it a deal impossible to get through parliament, impossible to sell to leave voters so cynically led to expect something better. If nothing else, history will surely remember her more kindly than either the architects of leave or her predecessor, David Cameron, whose catastrophic error of judgment landed us in this mess. They broke it, but she owned it, which explains the odd note of pity that creeps in when her name crops up in conversations beyond Westminster. It may now be for someone else to glue the pieces back together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba6e448cbd6a435d0359f07c69323707d90a59aa/0_180_5354_3212/master/5354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38de94488cb5225213a1067663f34a50","title":"facebooks pretensions have turned it into a useful idiot of the right","story":"The company employed a PR agency to attack its critics. Instead, it should learn its lesson and steer clear of politicsWhen companies reach a certain size, they can start to develop delusions of grandeur. If their annual revenue is equal to the GDP of a small country, and their customer base larger than the population of several, well, why shouldn’t they start behaving like they are a state themselves?That’s how you got William Randolph Hearst reportedly instructing an illustrator to “furnish the pictures and I’ll furnish the war” it’s how you got General Motors buying, and then shutting down, Los Angeles’ public transport network and it’s how you got Facebook hiring a public relations consultancy to run a fake news website full of stories about how the fake news sites run by Russia didn’t have an impact on the US presidential election.The rationale is impressive. If a Russian misinformation campaign could use fake grassroots activism to seed stories in the conservative media that ultimately swung mainstream political opinion, well, why can’t Facebook do the same thing?Thankfully, no matter how many listening tours Mark Zuckerberg embarks on, Facebook is not in fact a country, and he is not its president. That reality came crashing down on the company this week, when the New York Times revealed the extent of the dirty tactics Facebook deployed to try to keep its name clean. As well as downplaying the effect of Russian propaganda, the company’s PR firm also attacked critics, from corporate opponents such as Apple and Google to activist protesters such as Freedom from Facebook, which it linked to the philanthropist George Soros, a frequent target of far-right conspiracy theories.The social network has now fired Definers, the PR firm it hired to attack opponents, while simultaneously arguing that it did nothing wrong. Facebook now admits it “did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of Freedom of Facebook”, but seems to think that the fact that the funding came from George Soros is merely an unfortunate coincidence: “The intention was to demonstrate that it was not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign, as it claimed, but supported by a well-known critic of our company. To suggest that this was an antisemitic attack is reprehensible and untrue.”Whether or not you believe the shocked tones of Facebook’s denial is up to you. But what the scandal shows is that, even as Facebook grew into a company that desperately wanted to play on the political stage, it was always the one getting played instead. The malaise set in before the US presidential election, the paper reported, as Facebook, at the advice of its political advisers, turned down the opportunity to hold then-candidate Donald Trump to account for violating the site’s hate speech rules in his attack on Muslims. To do so, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, was told by her Washington office, ran the risk of making an enemy of the Republican party.That justification reared its head time and again. Facebook scrapped its trending news team, which had been hand-picking stories from mainstream news sources, over an allegation that it was biased against conservatives (that “bias” entailed believing the New York Times was more accurate than Breitbart News). It replaced those people with an algorithm, which promptly began promoting hoax stories into the trending topics sidebar. Eventually, the site shuttered the entire trending topics feature, and with that gave up for good on the idea of promoting healthy discourse on its site.Then, in 2017, after the election, the company published its investigation into misinformation on the site. But in the first edition of the report, published in April, the word “Russia” only appeared once, in a footnote. Again, the apparent reason was avoiding the ire of conservatives: the New York Times reported the company’s Washington lead, Joel Kaplan, arguing that “Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats” if it accurately attributed the campaign to Russia.Facebook has learned what the rest of the American media did long ago: the conservative establishment wields a sense of grievance like a cudgel, and will continue the beatings indefinitely while the political centre shifts, inexorably, rightwards. There’s no way out of that standoff through politics. The more the company attempts to refashion itself as a political actor, the harder it is to win those arguments. Facebook’s only hope is to see if it can dial back the delusions of statehood, and see itself for what it is: a consumer technology company with a core product that has a non-zero chance of rupturing democracy as a side-effect of making it easy to find your high school crush.That’s not an easy problem to solve. But it’s probably easier than the task of convincing the Republican party that a Silicon Valley-based, liberal-run tech company is its friend.• Alex Hern is a technology reporter for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84f58c41ee15f2598593230025a1c01ed19a589e/0_4_4365_2619/master/4365.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c35de2c6c523ff55ad8b2a704551d73","title":"tell us what impact is private tuition having on education","story":"We’d like to find out from parents, teachers, students – and tutors about why private tuition is on the rise.

But is their moment coming to an end as we tackle our waste problem?When was the last day you didn’t see a gull? Throughout Britain we ordinarily cross paths with these birds more often than with any other wild creature. They are hard to avoid. In the last 30 years – the life of a large gull – they have come among us as never before. Though still popularly regarded as seagulls, many have moved inland, far from the seaside or saltwater. They have adapted to life in many places we have made, and they have thrived.Cities and their hinterlands where we jettison our rubbish now sustain far more gulls than the birds’ former more traditional marine habitats. Indeed, in a paradox that might define the Anthropocene era, surviving coastal birds are now regarded as threatened with local extinction, while the same gull species in urban areas are so prevalent they are thought of as pests.Almost every human inhabitant of Britain’s cities could watch gulls every day if they wanted to. Urban rooftop nesting gull colonies are now spread throughout the UK. The birds feed among us, on our streets, as well as on our rubbish dumps. Many people are on their guard, however, because, one way or another, they have met the birds before and haven’t necessarily enjoyed the encounter. Gulls are frighteningly big – of a scale that seems out of sorts with their new habitat. They are loud. Their clawed feet stamp about the place. They lift off and fly with skill and menace, suggesting both ancient winged dinosaurs and futuristic drone ops. They seem to have an uncanny knowledge of what is going on and how to turn it to their advantage.Above all, they steal our chips. And these opportunistic scavenging raids on a staple of the national diet have come to epitomise a contemporary mashup of nature and people in the feral world we have made, which we must now live in and share with other animal life.As we have evolved in and adapted to an urban milieu, so the gulls have followed in our slipstream. And it now seems they will be with us, like badges of our creation, for the duration of this, our late hour. They are tracking us like no other bird: this year herring gulls were discovered drunk in south coast towns last year a herring gull was dyed a lurid orange after falling into a vat of curry in south Wales. These avian encounters with human activities say much about how we live today, yet we commonly despise the gulls for showing us these truths.The beginnings of this entangled story can be traced back to little over 100 years ago, when gulls first shifted from being seagulls. Among the early reporters on the arrival of black-headed gulls in inner London was the birdwatcher and conservationist WH Hudson. Severe winters in the late 1890s drew the birds upriver from even harsher coastal conditions. Many people regarded these ghostly white waifs as unwanted immigrants and shot at them, but Hudson (himself an immigrant from Argentina) saw the birds as beautiful additions to the urban avifauna.Hudson was moved by the sympathetic actions of “working people” who came to the Thames Embankment to feed scraps from their lunchboxes to the hungry birds. Since then, the gulls’ reliance on human food has continued to prompt many people to regard them as scavengers rather as entrepreneurs, as feckless immigrants rather than refugees, as chancers and idlers, as scroungers keen to exploit any handouts going.These ideas have dogged gulls all the way to our current annual panics, triggered when a wild animal reveals itself to be rather good at aping human life and finding a way to successfully live in the world that we have made. Every summer, horror stories appear in the news after tales of chip-thieving are beefed up with accounts of tortoise and chihuahua murders. “Experts” are found who are happy to predict that, after our precious chips and our blessed pets, it will not be long before human children (or “tots”, in tabloid terms) are taken.Gulls do seem big and they are strong. Every time I have been out ringing the large species on a rubbish dump in Essex, I have returned bloodied from holding the birds and with beak marks on my hands that took a week to fade.But gulls are losing out at our hands much more than the other way around. A gull moment – 30 years or so – is coming to an end. Little food waste is now going into landfill. We are still too wasteful, but now most gull-edible trash is being composted or incinerated. That is surely good, but it also means that the good times for herring and lesser black-backed and great black-backed gulls are over. They will have to shift their behaviour once more.

In Yorgos Lanthimos’s bawdy, brutal comedy The Favourite, the mental state of Queen Anne is weaponised by two women vying for her affections and, in turn, increased power in both her palace and the country. In Josie Rourke’s far more conventional, yet slickly entertaining Mary Queen of Scots, we see how the titular character clashes with Queen Elizabeth for control with the fates of many hanging in the balance. Tonally and visually, the two couldn’t be more different yet they both contain familiar observations about the swift sadism of life at the very top and how so much of the tension between these women was orchestrated by the men around them.While the life of Queen Anne has historically received minimal screen time, the more obviously cinematic dynamic between Mary and Elizabeth has inspired a number of retellings. We’ve seen Katharine Hepburn, Vanessa Redgrave and Samantha Morton play Mary while Glenda Jackson, Helen Mirren and Cate Blanchett have taken on Elizabeth, film-makers ever-fascinated by the difficult bond shared by the pair. Arguably it’s a tale that’s probably been told enough but there’s something undeniably tantalising about the idea of House of Cards developer Beau Willimon bringing his brand of murky corridor scheming to 16th-century politics. As with his Netflix show, there’s both a tight grasp of devilish powerplay and a slight over-reliance on soapy theatrics although the balance here mostly works. Think of it as more season one than season six.After spending most of her childhood in France, Mary (Saoirse Ronan) is arriving back to Scotland as an 18-year-old widow. There are concerns about her reappearance from half-brother, and temporary ruler, James (James McArdle) and Protestant cleric John Knox (David Tennant). Her Catholicism is instantly isive as is her unwillingness to be spoken down to by the men who are beneath her. Her arrival also ruffles feathers in England and pits her against her cousin Elizabeth (Margot Robbie) who, without child, is being pressured to name an heir. Mary sees herself as the instant candidate with Elizabeth in hushed agreement but those that circle the two queens fear for the future and start to plot, setting off a chain of events that threatens to destroy the two women.The machinations of those who dominated the period might be familiar to many but Rourke and Willimon have crafted a juicy, darkly compelling drama that offers a sleek alternative to what’s come before. It’s hardly revolutionary or particularly revisionist but there’s enough here to make it feel like a worthy endeavour nonetheless. Rourke, the Donmar’s artistic director, has a great deal of experience with stage productions yet Mary Queen of Scots marks her film debut. Stage-to-screen transitions can often be patchy but Rourke makes for an accomplished film-maker, artfully crafting some stunning imagery and pacing her story like a thriller. But while she manages to turn a supporting character’s murder into one of the year’s most haunting, horrifying death scenes, she’s less adept at turning an extraneous, messily choreographed battle scene into anything remotely thrilling.For the most part, Willimon does a nifty job at condensing a whole lot of information into what feels like a swift, two-hour running time. Historians have already labelled the film problematic from Mary’s Scottish accent (apparently it was French) to the film’s dramatic in-person confrontation between the two queens (apparently it never happened). But your annoyance with these deviations will depend on how you view the gap between history and historical drama and while there are some embellishments, they’re embellishments that have been added to previous adaptations and the primary facts appear relatively untainted, the truth shocking enough to propel the plot by itself.The film’s most thrilling pleasure is a show-stopping lead performance from Ronan, who at 24 is quickly becoming one of the industry’s most consistently impressive young actors. After her sparky Oscar-nominated turn as a Greta Gerwig conduit in Lady Bird, she’s note-perfect as Mary: vulnerable, terrifying, strong, sexy and effortlessly dominant when taking charge of the men who are trying to outsmart her. It is an astonishingly confident and committed turn and, in a just year, she’d be showered with more awards attention. There is also a rare reminder of just how young Mary was, along with so many other monarchs of the past, and there’s a clandestine silliness to some of the scenes of her with her handmaidens, cannily conveying a side often underexplored.Down in England however, things aren’t quite so successful. Much has already been made of Robbie’s transformation from one of the most desirable women in Hollywood to a queen ravaged by smallpox and reported jealousy of those she deemed more attractive. Yet Robbie, a skilled actor capable of illuminating lesser films such as Focus and Suicide Squad, never really convinces with the accent or the appearance and one can almost feel her focusing on both so much that she forgets to add much else to the role. It’s a glaring miscast that means one side of the film is always lacking, and given how many superior Elizabeths we’ve seen on big and small screens, it is the film’s biggest stumble. Yet Ronan dominates, both with screen time and presence and their much-discussed scene together does wield some power, despite some unnecessary visual trickery.In a busy awards season and with a strangely late festival bow, it is possible that Mary Queen of Scots, and Ronan’s killer lead performance, might get unfairly overlooked. It would be a shame as it is a finely constructed drama, avoiding stuffiness without slipping into camp territory and while diehard historians might disapprove, everyone else will be supremely entertained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c108eb030e9742f2efd0b95a4b5a830eb88b0f7/0_0_4728_2837/master/4728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc65cb8c3e12f594a60ff331ac9bc25d","title":"whos wrecking christmas quality street john lewis pick and mix","story":"British families sublimate seasonal rage through chocolate. Now the pick-and-mix tin is going to tear us apart…Like it or not, Christmas is bearing down upon us. It’s a special time for over-eating, socially sanctioned inebriation and, most importantly, for realising that your immediate family are a bunch of truly appalling, hateful people. T’was ever thus. When I was a kid, growing up with an agony aunt mother who ran her business salving emotional pain and distress from home, the busiest two weeks of the year were always the ones immediately following Christmas. The break stopped families getting away from each other. Cooped up at home because of the weather, crowds of people would end up writing to my mother announcing they now wished to orce their irritating spouses or put their dreadful children up for adoption or both.It could have been worse. For decades, many British families have learned to sublimate their festering rage over the festive period, through the medium of cheap chocolate: in particular, via arguments over the contents of the shared Christmas Quality Street tin. By fighting with each other over who ate all the orange cremes, and why there are only toffee pennies left and for God’s sake, you know exactly how important the green triangles are to me, generations of us have avoided arguing about anything of real importance. We bitch and squabble over crap confectionery and, satisfied that we have somehow made our point, retreat into a fine British position of quiet, sturdy mutual contempt.Well, brace yourselves. Nestlé, the current custodians of the Quality Street brand, have screwed this up. I would go so far as to say that they have risked ruining Christmas for millions of British households. Quality Street functioned as a pressure valve for family antagonism precisely because you never knew exactly what you would get in the tin. This year, Nestlé has created a pick-and-mix system, hosted within every branch of John Lewis. For a mere £15, you can create your own mix of a minimum of three, and a maximum of nine, of their classics. You want only caramel cups, purple ones and toffee pennies? (Ludicrous example. Nobody actually wants the toffee pennies. Apart from my wife. She’s weird.) That’s exactly what you can have. They’ll even print your name on the lid.Worst of all, it’s a massive hit. On a Monday lunchtime, weeks out from the festivities, London’s Oxford Street branch was full of people literally queuing up to destroy their own families from the inside. I went. I did it. I was the one who asked for a three-way split between those caramel cups, purple ones and toffee pennies. I took the tin home. We opened it and were faced by the unhealthiest thing possible: instant gratification. No arguments. No rows. One for me. One for her. One for the youngest. And the stone-cold certainty that without this to fight over, we were going to have to argue about something that actually mattered.There is a bitter irony to it being sold only through dear old John Lewis. The department store is practically regarded as a place of worship for Britain’s godless middle classes a tribe that specifically hates arguments. They want everything to be nice. They would rather pour molten iron on their own feet and stick pins in their eyes than actually say what they really think or feel about each other. And yet, by buying into this latest Quality Street marketing wheeze, this destruction of the traditional way of muddling through, they’re going to end up doing just that. I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news but Christmas 2018 is utterly buggered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ee3a1761396923e0c218b1ca77098006edf9e6c/69_168_4373_2624/master/4373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90effa2c8b41f83b0eba85e7179e6e6c","title":"wayne rooney england cheers hymn new age","story":"It was a slightly odd occasion and Rooney’s reappearance in an England shirt provided a reminder how much football has changedIn the end Wayne Rooney got the biggest cheer of the night. Which was, after all, the whole point. With 58 minutes gone there was a roar from the bleachers that almost became a full standing ovation as the crowd rose to clap and gawp, sucking the sweetness from the last of those big Rooney moments.He looked pretty much the same, just a little stiffer in this light and speedy England team. Rooney’s first act was to watch DeAndre Yedlin skim past him on the outside. He leaped for a couple of headers. A bit later a man in a red shirt ran on to the pitch and threw an arm around his shoulder before being led away by stewards, but nobody really seemed to mind much.Wayne redux was a fond, fun, slightly odd kind of thing. For long periods a basking, restless stadium felt more like a giant-scale village fete than a glossily staged international sporting event. Before kick-off, Wayne had appeared carrying one of his children and flanked by the other three. There was a restrained guard of honour. Rooney was presented with a shield, while just in front of him assorted military personnel perched on one knee, a little weirdly.Yes, this was a marketing stunt designed to make money. But then, professional football is a marketing stunt designed to make money. This is what we’re doing here, retailing entertainment. If enough people are willing to pay to see Ashley Cole dress up in a Beefeater’s outfit and juggle a bowl of rice pudding with his left foot then the FA could probably find a way to make that happen as well.It worked too. Wembley was two-thirds full. At times like these the PA becomes a huge, deafening echoey thing, rattling around those steeply banked empty plastic seats. In a way it felt quite apt. The Rooney era ned the age of the deadening Wembley night, of crowds that come in late and leave for the early tube, of mooching, one-paced England teams enlivened only by a brief moment of Wazza.As England kicked off, it was as though Gareth Southgate had decided to stage his own quietly phrased rebuttal of that recent past. He fielded another mobile, fluid super-youthful team. Seven of the starting XI were 25 or under and they were impressive in patches against a young, brittle, occasionally sparky USA.It was Jadon Sancho who got the banks of schoolkids on their feet in the opening exchanges. One lovely little no-look shimmy that left his man facing the wrong way drew approving gasps from the youthful cognoscenti. Evidence here of sick skills on the biggest stage.England’s two first-half goals were also a hymn to the new age sparked most decisively by Rooney’s own long-overdue dropping two years ago. First, Jesse Lingard provided a reprise of his goal against Panama, curling the ball beautifully over Brad Guzan. Then Sancho made one for Trent Alexander-Arnold with a cute pass, finished hard and low into the corner.Throughout that period, England provided a fine advert for the benefits of moving the old guard along, for investing in youth and unscarred potential. Sancho was the real star turn, playing with his head up, moving intelligently from wing to wing, able to take the ball on the move and spring into space.There are comparisons with Rooney to be made, albeit Rooney at the same age was a genuine phenomenon. Aged 18, he was already the best Rooney, an attacking footballer with a fearsome cutting edge. Sancho isn’t that yet, but he has the same kind of joy and brio, the same sense of ownership of the spectacle, challenging everyone else on the pitch to look quite this good with a football at his feet. He has the same street footballer smarts too, a kid from Kennington who now has it all spread out in front of him, the full range of triumph and trauma to come.But then Sancho – so smart, so clued up – is also a reminder of just how much the culture around these players has changed, how gauche and pink and newborn Rooney still looked at the same age. Rooney’s was a journey without maps, the mature Premier League’s first teenage-superstar, barrelling around in that baggy white England kit like a pasty-faced pitch-invader.Things have become more orderly for those that have followed, coping structures devised for the glare, the money, the distractions. Learn from Wayne, young England starlets. In more ways than one.Callum Wilson scored England’s third late on. For a while England seemed to be trying to tee Rooney up for a clear shot at goal that never quite came.At the end there were hugs and chest bumps and as the stadium emptied a few last rounds of “Ladeeez and gentlemen, one last tiiiiiime ... WAAAYNE ROONEY”. Was it necessary to do all this? No. Is it worth getting upset about? No. Was it a bit weird? Yes. But the Rooney farewell seemed fair enough, a great England player with enough fondness among the crowd to make it a fun, warm occasion. Best of all, Wayne: The Return was a sign of just how far England have moved on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db06657dee5853b96de3ca72dd25df85ffcd4fee/0_87_2535_1522/master/2535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef04f3aecdbc268a5fedd2e29068db67","title":"gibraltar jayce olivero abingdon hazard","story":"Student and non-league defender on the thrill of turning out for his country and tears that greeted their first competitive winIf Craig David considers his 7 Days hectic, he clearly has never met Jayce Olivero. Take the international break last month when Olivero and his country tasted their first competitive win, against Armenia Saturday 13 October 2018 will live with Gibraltar forever. By the Tuesday night they were celebrating another, against Liechtenstein, and by Wednesday afternoon, via Gatwick airport, he was back home in Headington. By 9am Thursday, Olivero, a third-year student at Oxford Brookes University, was sitting in a two-hour lecture. Two days later he helped Abingdon United beat ninth-tier Tuffley Rovers in the Hellenic League Challenge Cup.Olivero, who had trials at Leicester and West Ham in his mid-teens, knows what is coming. “I always get that question,” he says, laughing. “I’ve been very fortunate to play against players like Hazard, Lukaku, Dzeko, Nani, all these great players … Kompany, Courtois, just a big list of brilliant players. Kevin De Bruyne.Olivero speaks eloquently about juggling his BSc sport, coaching and physical education degree with playing for Gibraltar, for whom he made his debut aged 17. They play on an artificial pitch at Victoria Stadium, round the corner from the international airport, with that looming limestone rock as the backdrop.“It is crazy for spectators, who are watching the game and all of a sudden there are planes landing a few metres away,” Olivero says. “It’s crazy, but it’s just the way it is. What really is special is that big rock that overlooks our pitch and our stadium. I think that is what really inspires us. When our national anthem goes off, we are looking up at the rock. That rock holds everything, it is everything we are and represent. That rock is really special.”It was the match in Yerevan that captured the hearts of those far beyond Gibraltar. After 22 games without a competitive win, Gibraltar, who five years ago became Uefa’s smallest member with a population of around 35,000, had won.The homecoming was special. On the ground along with GBC, Gibraltar’s public service broadcaster, and a sea of supporters were almost a dozen of Olivero’s relatives, each wearing match-worn shirts carrying his name and number. “Every time I play I have given a shirt to a member of my family a shirt, so they all have one. It makes me happier to see them wearing the top and them feeling proud rather me just having it in my room.”The defender counts De Bruyne, Hazard and Ricardo Quaresma among his toughest opponents but is loth to swap shirts with players he considers to be his heroes. “I really value the shirt of Gibraltar, our history and our past,” he says. “That’s why I like to keep them because years down the line I want to look back and remember playing.He believes being rejected by Leicester and West Ham made him mentally stronger and exposed the areas of his game he needed to improve. When he was on trial at Leicester, in February 2016, the club were en route to being crowned Premier League champions.For now, his focus is Friday’s Nations League qualifier against Armenia. Olivero will miss Abingdon’s trip on Saturday to Flackwell Heath in the Hellenic Premier League but will return in time for next week’s home match against Brackley Town Saints.Will it be another famous night on the rock? “Hopefully,” Olivero says. “We always have to remain humble. We have got things clear. We have won, we have made history but there is a lot more things to achieve. We have to keep our heads down, keep working and trying to improve. I have tasted that feeling of success and I just want it again. We know what we have to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/155fc415e274389914923f84983fef4c2e5fc8dc/0_97_2678_1607/master/2678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27e4a14f9be2eb1d69393557a367fcc1","title":"wayne rooney tears stop gareth southgate england dressing down","story":"• Southgate unhappy with second-half performance• Rooney: ‘It was a special day for me and my family’Gareth Southgate shelved plans to criticise his players for their second-half performance in victory over USA after Wayne Rooney stole the stage by delivering a tearful post-match speech in the dressing room as he called time on his England career.Southgate had been dissatisfied with aspects of the team’s display after half-time, his thoughts already turning to Sunday’s deciding Nations League match against Croatia where England can either claim their three-team group or, should they lose or score draw, be relegated to League B. Southgate intended to point out the team’s shortcomings immediately after the final whistle, only for Rooney to take to the floor to thank the group for welcoming him back into the fold.“There were some good moments but I didn’t like us as much without the ball, and they got through us too easily in the second half,” said Southgate as he assessed what ended up a comfortable victory.“We didn’t play with discipline in the end. We were wide open and, if we do that on Sunday, we will lose. We haven’t had that discussion yet because Wayne gave a really nice speech at the end and I didn’t want to rain on his parade, but we’ll be making that point before Sunday.“If we want to be a top team we can’t get to 3-0 and suddenly decide not to play without the ball. We have to play with intelligence right through the game.“We were very keen that we moved on from the World Cup as quickly as possible, but it has been a brilliant year. Whatever happens on Sunday, we’ve got real shoots of progress and have achieved some outstanding results and really good performances, and blooded a lot of new players.“There’s depth and competition for places. But everyone wants to go another stage and get to a semi-final out of a group that is as tough as there is in this competition. So Sunday is a good game to look forward to, with a sellout crowd and a game with plenty riding on it. Someone is probably sitting in Geneva patting himself proudly on the back.”Rooney’s 120th and final cap amounted to a 32-minute cameo, and a shot with virtually his last touch which Brad Guzan did well to save, as the nation’s record goalscorer bowed out after a glittering 15-year career at this level. “It went as I imagined it, really,” he said.“It’s been great the last few days, to see how they’re working and improving. It’s great the Football Association are celebrating players who have left a mark on international football in England. It’s the right thing to do and I’m sure it will happen again.“Before playing the game I asked Harry Kane to present me with the award because I believe he will beat my goalscoring record and I look forward to presenting him with the trophy. It was a special day for me and my family.”Southgate said: “It’s difficult, even as a senior player, to walk back into a dressing room where there are new staff and a lot of players he hadn’t played with, but he’s been brilliant.“The time he’s giving to all the players, the little conversations with some of the younger ones … he spoke about what playing for England had meant to him, and what it should mean to the three debutants. Then there was the humility he showed in training, tracking back in the five-a-sides as if his life depended on it.“He had some lovely touches tonight, too, and some exquisite through balls, and ended up a yard to the left of Brad Guzan from a fairytale ending.“We wanted to test some young players, and we had a very inexperienced team out there, but they’ve come through and learned a lot, and we’ve paid our respects to one of our greatest ever players. We did that in a way we felt was fitting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a053756d3d0434e9f70a9be730f97072e833b6ab/1015_984_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=207318e4a254535b6f1d72c912fe78a0","title":"experience i dropped two nuclear bombs","story":"The sky lit up 10,000ft above our eye level was a writhing molten mass. I was in aweI became aware of Operation Grapple in July 1956. There wasn’t a big Top Secret stamp on it. Everyone in the country had an idea that Britain was trying to become a nuclear power. I was a 22-year-old co-pilot in the RAF, just happy to be chosen for the mission.My main role was to monitor the flight instruments to make sure the captain was flying correctly. We practised dummy drops for months, flying Valiant bombers from Wittering airbase on the CambridgeshireNorthamptonshire border to a range over Orford Ness.After almost a year perfecting the drills with 1321 flight and, later, No 49 Squadron, we left for Christmas Island. Our drop proper came on 31 May 1957. The target was Malden, a tiny uninhabited island in the Pacific. After 50 minutes of flying we reached the rendezvous and the bomb aimer, one of five crew, went to lie down on a mattress in the well in the belly of the fuselage from that position, he looked straight ahead through the bomb sight at the aiming point. We then made a practice run – up to the release point, then a sharp turn to get away. When the order was given to proceed with the live run, we put metal shutters over all the windows in the cockpit so the violent light from the explosion wouldn’t affect our eyesight the bomb aimer had to keep his shutter open until the drop, though. I could only see through a small piece of welder’s glass in one of them. Despite being 45,000ft above the Pacific, we were in total darkness, the captain, Sqn Ldr David Roberts, and I flew purely by instruments.The bomb aimer took the safety latch off the weapon and said, “Steady, steady, steady”, to get us to hold our heading. As we crossed the release point, he pressed the button and announced, “Bomb’s gone.” We felt some elation, and the aircraft noticeably lifted as the 12,500lb bomb – codenamed Orange Herald – fell away. But almost immediately came the escape manoeuvre: Roberts rolled the aircraft into a steeply banked turn to get away from the upward rush of the exploding nuclear bomb. If we had carried on in a straight line, the fireball would have come up under the aircraft and that would have been it. The trouble was the accelerometer wasn’t showing any G-force at all. I told the captain “More G!” but as he pulled back on the stick we started to judder the aircraft was stalling. We had been turning, we just hadn’t felt the added G. We realised the accelerometer wasn’t working, and the overcorrection sent the bomb aimer – who was making for his seat – crashing back into the well.We knew that if we didn’t turn, we wouldn’t escape the explosion. Thankfully the captain regained control, the bomb aimer scrambled to his seat and, 53 seconds after the moment of release, the weapon exploded. Complete darkness turned to unfiltered daylight. It was as if there was no dark glass in the small aperture you could see the sky and the land below as clear as anything. Three minutes later, we felt a biggish bump as the shockwave hit the aircraft, then a smaller one a second later. We saw the sky lit up 10,000ft above our eye level was a writhing molten mass. I was in a state of awe. At 85, I’m one of three aircrew still alive from Operation Grapple, and to my knowledge I’m the only person to drop two nuclear bombs. For my second flight, the captain was Sqn Ldr Barney Millett, and instead of targeting an atoll like Malden, the drop on 8 November was just off Christmas Island itself. Same procedure, this time no faulty instruments, though this was a thermonuclear bomb – a hydrogen bomb yielding 1.8 megatonnes of TNT – more than twice the power of the previous one.We were checked with a Geiger counter when we got back: it wasn’t mentioned that we were in major danger, so no one was in a state of jitters. To date, I haven’t had medical issues resulting from Grapple, but I know that people on the ground who watched the explosions claim to have been affected. I think the services took the precautions they believed sufficient, but I don’t want to decry the people who say they have fallen ill.As for the ethics, my feeling was, it was a weapon of war. Whether it’s a 1,000lb bomb or a 10,000lb bomb, they’re not nice things to have, but they’re essential to defend our country. This was at the height of the cold war. The Soviet Union was a powerful nation we assumed it would use nuclear weapons if necessary, just as we would have done.• As told to Nick Thompson.Do you have an experience to share?

I don’t know many people who would change their vote. We pay out too much money to the EU, we should be running our country ourselves.”On Thursday most Brexiters who spoke to the  said they would not change their minds. “We’re better off leaving,” said McAllister’s colleague Julie Slynn. She pointed out a Polish shop opposite and another one a couple of doors up. “There are too many foreigners around here. I reckon you hear four Polish to every two English when you walk around. They are taking our jobs, getting the houses. That’s one of the main reasons I voted for Brexit.”Their customer David Miller, who described himself as a welder and an evangelist, said he felt a little sorry for Theresa May. “She had this dumped on her and I think she’s handling it as best she can. She’s under immense pressure.”Miller said he voted to leave because he thought Brussels imposed some “silly” laws on the UK. “Why should we be dominated by them?” But he also had an unusual main reason for supporting leave. “I follow the prophesies in the Bible and a split in Europe was prophesied. Europe will never unite again. God has said so.”Kevin Houston, a former soldier, was stationed behind a row of union flags on a stall in the indoor market selling pipes and other smoking paraphernalia. He had been following developments from Westminster all day and was not impressed by the agreement the prime minister was trying to sell.“If Theresa May worked for a private company and was sent away for two years to carry out negotiations and came back with that, she’d be sacked straight away,” he said. “It’s a fudge, it’s not what we voted for. We’ve lost everything and are giving them £39bn. I think she ought to stand down. Jacob Rees-Mogg should replace her. He talks sense, I reckon he’d deliver Brexit.“We’re supposed to be a democracy, we shouldn’t be ruled by Brussels, we should take back control.”Sean Williams, who owns three pet shops in and around the town, said he voted out partly because EU rules forced him to take dozens of products including ear, eye and flea treatments off his shelves. “That was frustrating.”But he had sympathy for May. “I think she’s doing a good job. I don’t think David Cameron should have been allowed to walk away when he did. It’s impossible to satisfy everybody, which is what some people seem to expect her to do.”There were a few who said they would relish the chance to vote in a new referendum. Sam Jones, 19, a student, was too young to vote in 2016. “I’d vote remain if I got the chance. I think the decision ought to be put back to the people,” he said.Jay Mailer, who was walking through the town centre with two of her children as the town’s Christmas lights were being hung up, agreed. “I must admit I voted out but I regret it now. I’ve learned more about it. I’d like my kids to get a chance to work abroad and I think Europe is a bit of a safety net. I’ll vote remain if I get the chance again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5e0a35dd6fadc8bf88e983f7f2d8b42f5485609/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2111db3a3849632d7d2cd7c93d4f870f","title":"may has no credibility left readers on the brexit deal","story":"Readers are discussing cabinet resignations and the prime minister’s statement in the CommonsMay, along with her plan, is dead in the water. The proposed agreement (should we now call it the “Draft Disagreement”?) seems unlikely to get through parliament and she now has no credibility left. Brexit, always an impossible fantasy, is unravelling. Surely this whole charade needs to be given a quiet burial and Article 50 rescinded so that we can move on to rebuilding our links with the EU as a fully-engaged member? CaroleB999It is becoming increasingly obvious that the whole decision should be passed back to the electorate. The argument from the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg etc that “democracy has spoken” does not hold true. In June 2016 the people of this country were asked to sign a blank cheque after a campaign of lies and myths, “easy trade deals, 350 million for the NHS”. It has been proven over the past two wasted years Brexit is creating a crisis not seen since Suez and the second world war. Brexiteers are running scared of another vote, many young adults now have the vote, it is their future that is being played with. I should add I am 68 years old and a staunch remainer: the EU is not perfect but the alternative is much, much worse. kimorrisYou know what’s tragically hilarious about all of this? One of the reasons people want to leave the EU is because they believe the UK can negotiate stronger trade deals with the wider world than the EU can manage. How’s that looking, Leavers? We couldn’t even negotiate the orce settlement like professionals. Keith TaylorNo Deal looking very likely now. Bad times ahead, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable in society. The rich among us will feed like vultures on the financial chaos that ensues. Every food, health and welfare standard will get binned to obtain bad trade deals. The NHS will be sold piecemeal to American companies in order to facilitate trade deal too. It’s going to be a mess that’ll take us 20 years to recover from – if we ever do. NTDRaab, like Davis and Johnson before him, is running off the stage so he doesn’t have to confront the consequences of his outrageous lies. Easiest deal in history? We hold all the cards? This was supposed to be a glorious national liberation. Instead, we’re being humiliated and reduced. Or is that still ‘Project Fear’? UltralightbeamThis is the inevitable consequence of having a rational person as PM. She knew from the start that the Brexiter’s unicorns could not be delivered without trashing the economy. In retrospect it would have been better to have had Andrea Leadsom as PM and a cabinet full of true believers. Then they would not be able to hide behind May and pretend that they could have done a better job. I think a general election is on its way. SowesterHard to know what Corbyn is pitching. Is he suggesting we should go into a general election, where Labour will sweep to power on the promise of more extensions and transitions while Corbyn has his own pop at unpicking freedom of movement from the “four freedoms”, like a sword from a stone, so that the “six tests” are met? KlaatuI have now found a paragraph about Northern Irish citizenship. They are being allowed to have EU privileges we are not? That must be wrong. Nothing about the rest of us having our EU citizenship arbitrarily confiscated against our will. I am writing to our MP about that. Some time ago I wrote to Verhofstadt and he was sympathetic, saying he hoped to table a motion for us Europhiles to keep some form of EU citizenship but I have heard no more. The whole Brexit thing is gross insult to remain supporters (over half the electorate now it seems) and surely of questionable legality, or if not, most certainly morally unacceptable. weightheevidenceTwo years ago Britain walked out on a long marriage to the EU. The EU just didn’t understand Britain. Free at last, Britain would hook up with younger fitter models around the world. Yesterday Britain got shown into the new bedsit. On the bed was a box with lawyer’s bills, a maintenance agreement and an unfavourable custody arrangement. sanjeevaGo back and think again seems like the only rational idea at this point. What do the British people want? To jump right out, to maintain connection, or stay in? If the combined numbers of jump and connect are more than remain, let this miserable process continue. If Remain outnumbers both of those, we can draw a line under the past two years and everyone can get on with their lives.

However, after a debate lasting two and a half hours, another peer and supporter of Lester, David Pannick, forced a vote.He tabled an amendment to the report saying it should be sent back to the committee because it had not acted “in accordance with the principles of natural justice and fairness”. The vote was won by 101 to 78, stopping the suspension.Sanghera, 53, said she felt the punishment had been blocked by “what I can only describe as the old boy network”.She said: “I feel as if I’ve been victimised all over again, bullied and traduced. What I witnessed there today were many of Lord Lester’s friends, who declared that they were his friends, making representations on behalf of him. And I don’t think that was fair.“This process has gone through three levels, all legal appeals were rejected, and today they’ve undermined the whole process and undermined the commissioner and me.Lester, 82, who has denied the claims, objected to the process, saying it was wrong that he had been unable to cross-examine Sanghera’s evidence, whether directly or via a representative.Lord Pannick, also a leading QC, made the argument in the debate that “you are entitled to cross-examine or have cross-examination conducted, of the person who accuses you”.But Sanghera’s lawyers say they were surprised that Lester complained about the way the inquiry was handled only after it was over.The alleged harassment is said to have taken place around 11 years ago, and Sanghera first reported it to parliamentary authorities in November 2017.After an investigation by the Lords commissioner for standards, the subcommittee on Lords conduct recommended Lester be expelled – the first time such action would have been taken.However, Lester appealed, and, while the privileges and conduct committee upheld the conclusion, it opted for suspension, as the rule allowing expulsion was only introduced in 2015.Sanghera told the inquiry that the harassment began after she attended a meeting at the Lords and missed her evening train. Lester suggested she stay at his London home.He groped her thigh while driving her to the house and made suggestive remarks, she said. The next morning, when his wife had left, Lester chased Sanghera around the kitchen, she said.It was at a later meeting at the Lords, she said, that Lester made the offer. She told the inquiry: “He even spelled it out, putting my surname in, and asked me how that sounded.”The report said Sanghera, who was not named in the investigation but came forward afterwards, provided six witnesses, among them a judge, who were able to say she had described the events immediately after she said they had taken place.John McFall, the senior deputy speaker in the Lords, said he was “deeply disappointed” in the vote, and the privileges and conduct committee would meet next week to decide the next step.“I fully support the commissioner for standards and the work she has undertaken for many months. Every step of the way she followed the processes as agreed by the house and that have not been questioned before today. I would also like to express my sympathy to the complainant at what must be a very difficult time for her,” Lord McFall said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70279f4780f7851665f5d8707432709f845eed9f/0_23_2085_1251/master/2085.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01752edc932b69cdf852682a64c613fb","title":"six possible scenarios in light of theresa may brexit deal","story":"If draft withdrawal agreement is rejected this could trigger vote of no confidence, snap election or people’s voteWhat possible scenarios might happen in the light of Theresa May’s Brexit deal?May faces an enormous task to win parliamentary approval, given that Labour, the SNP, the DUP and 51 Tories have said they will not vote for it.If the remaining 27 EU member states sign off the draft agreement on 25 November, the government will have to win over MPs at a crucial vote in early December.If May loses the vote, she has 21 days to put forward a new plan. If she wins, she is safe for now.The prime minister could decide that she will not get the draft agreement through parliament and could seek to renegotiate with the EU.This would anger Tory backbenchers and Brussels and would be seen as a humiliation for her government. It might spark a leadership contest too.May could ask the European council to extend article 50, giving her more time to come up with a deal that could be passed by parliament – at present, the UK will leave on 29 March 2019.Such a request would not necessarily be granted. Some EU governments are under pressure from populist parties to get the UK out of the EU as soon as possible.If Conservative MPs believe May is no longer fit for office, they could trigger a no-confidence vote.Members of the European Research Group claim that Graham Brady, the chair of the powerful 1922 Committee, will receive the necessary 48 letters this week.A vote could be held as soon as early next week. All Tory MPs would be asked to vote for or against their leader. If May wins, she cannot be challenged for at least 12 months. If she loses, there would be a leadership contest to decide who will become prime minister.If May fails to get support for the current deal, she could call a snap general election.She would table a parliamentary vote for a general election that would have to be passed by two thirds of MPs. She would then set an election date, which could be by the end of January.This is an unlikely option. May’s political credibility was severely damaged when she called a snap election in 2017, leading to the loss of the Conservative party’s majority.Alternatively, a general election could be called if a simple majority of MPs vote that they have no confidence in the government. Seven Tory MPs, or all of the DUP MPs, would have to turn against the government for it to lose the vote, triggering a two-week cooling-off period. May would remain in office while MPs negotiate a new government.Another route to a general election would be for the government to repeal or amend the Fixed-term Parliaments Act which creates a five-year period between general elections. A new act would have to be passed through both the Commons and the Lords – an unlikely scenario.May could decide it is impossible to find a possible draft deal that will be approved by parliament and go for a people’s vote.The meaningful vote could be amended to allow MPs to vote on whether the country holds a second referendum. It is unclear whether enough MPs would back a second referendum and May has ruled it out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9677374f0a3efcd8db3d1b27d83d4e68c847b745/0_110_6079_3648/master/6079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06f2fa963855ef8ff089904d163ed31d","title":"brexit paranoid fantasy fintan otoole","story":"In the dark imagination of English reactionaries, Britain is always a defeated nation – and the EU is the imaginary invaderBefore the narrative of Len Deighton’s bestselling thriller SS-GB begins, there is a “reproduction” of an authentic-looking rubber-stamped document: “Instrument of Surrender – English Text. Of all British armed forces in United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland including all islands.” It is dated 18 February 1941. After ordering the cessation of all hostilities by British forces, it sets down further conditions, including “the British Command to carry out at once, without argument or comment, all further orders that will be issued by the German Command on any subject. Disobedience of orders, or failure to comply with them, will be regarded as a breach of these surrender terms and will be dealt with by the German Command in accordance with the laws and usages of war.”Written amid the anxieties of Britain’s early membership of the European Communities and published in 1978, Deighton’s thriller sets up two ideas that will become important in the rhetoric of Brexit. Since there is no sense that Deighton has a conscious anti-EU agenda, the idea seems to arise from a deeper structure of feeling in England. One is the fear of the Englishman turning into the “new European”, fitting himself into the structures of German domination. His central character is a harbinger of the “rootless cosmopolitan” who cannot be trusted to uphold English independence and English values, and who therefore functions as the enemy within, the quisling class of pro-Europeans. This is the treason of the elite, the puppet politicians and sleek mandarins who quickly accommodate themselves to the new regime.Deighton was building on real historical memories of the appeasers whose prewar conduct makes the notion that they would have quickly become collaborators in the event of a defeat to the Nazis highly credible. This idea of a treacherous elite would later ferment into a heady and intoxicating brew of suspicion that the Brexiteers would both dispense to the masses and consume themselves. (In 2014, the BBC announced plans for a five-part TV version, which was screened in 2017, shortly after Brexit.)The other crucial idea here is the vertiginous fall from “heart of Empire” to “occupied colony”. In the imperial imagination, there are only two states: dominant and submissive, coloniser and colonised. This dualism lingers. If England is not an imperial power, it must be the only other thing it can be: a colony. And, as Deighton successfully demonstrated, this logic can be founded in an alternative English history. The moment of greatest triumph – the defeat of the Nazis – can be reimagined as the moment of greatest humiliation – defeat by the Nazis. The pain of colonisation and defeat can, in the context of uneasy membership of the EU, be imaginatively appropriated. (Boris Johnson, in the  of 12 November, claimed that “we are on the verge of signing up for something even worse than the current constitutional position. These are the terms that might be enforced on a colony.”)SS-GB was in part the inspiration for an even more successful English thriller, Robert Harris’s multimillion-selling Fatherland, published in 1992 and filmed for television in 1994. Harris had begun the novel in the mid-1980s but abandoned it. He revived and finished it explicitly in the context of German reunification in 1990 and of fears that the enemy Britain had defeated twice in the 20th century would end the century by dominating it: “If,” Harris wrote in the introduction to the 20th anniversary edition in 2012, “there was one factor that suddenly gave my fantasy of a united Germany a harder edge, it was the news that exactly such an entity was unexpectedly returning to the heart of Europe.”In retrospect, German reunification is perhaps the greatest missed opportunity for the English finally to have done with the war. Had there been a capacity to generate new narratives of Europe, this could have been shaped as a moment of British vindication – the final working-out of the consequences of nazism. As Anthony Barnett puts it, “the triumph and relief of the unification of Germany could and should have belonged to us in Britain, as well as to Germany itself. It was the final liberation from nazism, the end of that country’s punishment, a time to welcome a great culture back into our arms.”Why, then, were there no photographs of Margaret Thatcher and Helmut Kohl holding hands at the Brandenburg Gate to match the pictures of Kohl and François Mitterrand at Verdun in 1984? Because Thatcher literally carried in her handbag maps showing German expansion under the Nazis. This was a mental cartography that English conservatism could not transcend – the map of a Europe that may no longer exist in reality, but within which its imagination remains imprisoned. “Europe,” Barnett writes, “moved on from the second world war and Britain didn’t.” One might go so far as to say that England never got over winning the war.In fact, Britain not only did not move on in 1990 – with the resurrection of a united Germany, it moved back. Harris is no anti-European reactionary and would become one of the most furious critics of Brexit. Yet, like Deighton, he was tapping into profound national anxieties.The real twist of the knife in Harris’s story is that the novel is set in Germany and the main characters are German. There is nothing of significance to say about England 20 years after its surrender. Except, that is, that is part of a European Union: “In the west, 12 nations – Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, Great Britain, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland – had been corralled by Germany, under the Treaty of Rome, into a European trading bloc. German was the official second language in all schools. People drove German cars, listened to German radios, watched German televisions, worked in German-owned factories, moaned about the behaviour of German tourists in German-dominated holiday resorts, while German teams won every international sporting competition except cricket, which only the English played.”A dystopian fantasy this may be, but in the English reactionary imagination, dystopian fantasy was and is indistinguishable from reality. Rhetorically, it was commonplace among British anti-Europeans that the EU was a continuation in another, more insidious form, of previous attempts at domination from the continent. In 1989, for example, the Bruges Group of anti-European Tories heard Prof Kenneth Minogue of the London School of Economics tell them that “the European institutions were attempting to create a European Union, in the tradition of the mediaeval popes, Charlemagne, Napoleon, the Kaiser and Adolf Hitler”.The cover of that issue of the Spectator’s bore the headline “Speaking for England” – a conscious reference to one of the moments of high drama in September 1939 when Leo Amery in the House of Commons invited Labour’s Arthur Greenwood to “Speak for England!”, implying that the appeasing prime minister Neville Chamberlain did not do so.Ridley’s remarks were dismissed by Lutz Stavenhagen, minister of state in the German foreign office, as the sort of thing that might be heard “in the pub after a football match”. And Ridley himself had to resign. But these were not the mere rantings of a marginal crank. As Peter Jenkins wrote in the Independent at the time, “it is widely supposed that Mrs Thatcher’s heart is with him, if not her head … It is no secret that she, like him, fears that monetary and economic union in Europe will become the tool of German domination rather than the means of containing a united Germany. She too instinctively mistrusts the Germans and finds it impossible to forget the experiences of the second world war.”Thatcher had the Falklands war. It may have been a last hurrah for Britain’s imperial pretensions, but it functioned even better as a kind of epilogue to the great psychodrama of the second world war and a real-life version of the invasion thrillers. In her victory speech of July 1982, Thatcher was quite explicit in invoking the Falklands as a renaissance of the old wartime spirit, and victory as proof that Britain was no different then from what it had been during its Finest Hour. She chided those who believed that “we could never again be what we were”. The doubters “were wrong. The lesson of the Falklands is that Britain has not changed and that this nation still has those sterling qualities which shine through our history. This generation can match their fathers and grandfathers in ability, in courage, and in resolution. We have not changed. When the demands of war and the dangers to our own people call us to arms – then we British are as we have always been.”Yet even in this triumphal mode, Thatcher gave new life to the metaphors of retreat and invasion. “We have ceased to be a nation in retreat,” she said, implying that the nation had been precisely that for a long time. “Why,” she asked, “do we have to be invaded before we throw aside our selfish aims and begin to work together … ?”Within this question is a claim: “we” were invaded. The beauty of the Falklands conflict is that it played out the invasion fantasy of SS-GB – a fascist regime violating the sanctity of the homeland – but at a safe distance of almost 8,000 miles. The tiny population of the Falklands – 1,820 people in 1982 – served as a metaphor for the UK. “British people,” said Thatcher, “had to be threatened by foreign soldiers and British territory invaded and then – why then – the response was incomparable.” What had not happened in 1939–45 had finally happened in 1982.It helped that the tiny Falklands population that was serving this microcosmic function was almost entirely white – a “British people” that no longer existed – and that this “British territory” was an almost entirely rural landscape. The Falklands was a kind of make-believe England with no black and brown immigrants. Its pre-industrial terrain was a fantasy version of the post-industrial landscape that Thatcher herself was in fact creating at home in England, without the empty steel plants and rusting machines.It was not just war that was needed to reassure Britain that it had a meaningful collective existence, it was the idea of invasion and submission.There could be no release from the dark fantasies haunting the imagination of British conservatism, and there would continue to be a need for an imaginary invader and dominator. In 1990, while Germany was being reunified, there was very little depth to anti-German feeling in Britain – surveys at the time showed that most British people were in favour of German unity and trusted the Germans a lot or somewhat. The imagining of a German-dominated Europe through the evocation of Hitler was not an authentic popular prejudice against an old enemy. It was a way – albeit one that still seemed to have few real-world consequences – of thinking about the European Union itself, of summoning it into being as the ghastly ghost, not just of the Nazis, but of Nazis who had in reality won the war.The war imagery filled a hole. England had no deep imaginative commitment to the European project. As an idea, the EU had a distinctly weak grip on English allegiance. It was always understood by most people as a more or less grudging concession to reality, a matter for resigned acceptance rather than joyous embrace. The popular mood a year after Britain joined was nicely captured by an official at the Department of Trade and Industry, who likened the British public to “a crowd of holidaymakers who, after much doubt and expense, have made a dangerous journey only to find the climate chilly, the hotel not what it was cracked up to be and the food too expensive … bloodthirsty feelings are mounting, not only towards the other nationalities in the hotel but to the courier who got them there.”Yet a result that seemed both decisive and conclusive proved to be neither – Europe continued to poison British politics. And perhaps one of the reasons it did so is that, as the 1975 referendum campaign showed, there was a very deep underlying ision about the meaning of the second world war. The war was – and remains – crucial in structuring English feeling about the European Union. In 1975, many of the leading advocates on both sides were veterans, as were many voters. But instead of this common experience creating a common emotional ideal of Britain’s relationship to Europe, it fed two completely opposite stories, each very deeply felt.One of these stories was that the catastrophic experience of the first half of the 20th century carried two lessons that must never be forgotten: unrestrained nationalism led to war, and Britain could not stand aside from the fate of Europe. As the historian Robert Saunders has shown, the successful pro-European campaigners in 1975 were both highly explicit and highly emotive in making these connections. For them, “the emphasis was on the horror of war, which had devoured millions of lives in the prosecution of national rivalries. Britain in Europe used the poppy, the flower of remembrance, in its literature, while its logo was a dove of peace.” Pro-Europe posters said “Nationalism kills” and “No more Civil Wars”. Another, published for the anniversary of victory in Europe, directly evoked the joy of that triumph and sought to channel it into a sense that the common market was the great reward for victory: “On VE Day we celebrated the beginnings of peace. Vote Yes to make sure we keep it.” Another poster read simply: “Forty million people died in two European wars this century. Better lose a little sovereignty than a son or daughter.”These appeals worked for the majority of voters, but this very mention of sovereignty opened up, for a significant minority, a gaping wound. “For some,” wrote Saunders, “the surrender of national sovereignty to the EEC was a betrayal of all those who had fought and died ‘to deliver Europe from Nazi dictatorship’.” A woman from Bournemouth wrote to the anti-EEC Labour minister Barbara Castle that “I … did not fight and suffer a war for six years to be dictated to by the Germans.” “Hitler’s ghost,” wrote another of Castle’s correspondents, “must be shaking with laughter at Roy Jenkins, Hattersley \u0026amp the rest of the traitor crew.” Some, Saunders writes, “viewed the Community as a new power-grab by Germany, a country which ‘on two occasions … has failed to conquer the British militarily’”. For Castle’s correspondents, the notion “that the GERMANS love us any more today than they did in 1914 \u0026amp 1939” was dismissed with contempt. “The leopard does not easily change its spots.”What’s striking is that we can begin to see in this hysterical rhetoric the outlines of two notions that would become crucial to Brexit discourse. One is the comparison of pro-European Brits to quislings, collaborators, appeasers and traitors. The leave campaign in 1975 likened the treaty of accession to the Munich agreement of 1938, remembered as a shameful act of surrender to the Germans. Christopher Frere-Smith, who ran the Get Britain Out campaign, warned repeatedly that accession to the common market marked a “new Munich”, with Ted Heath and Roy Jenkins (who was leading the in campaign) playing the roles of Neville Chamberlain and his foreign secretary Lord Halifax. Voters were warned not be “fooled by the press bosses and the establishment politicians. They were wrong about Hitler and they’re wrong again.”But the other idea is the fever-dream of an English Resistance, and its weird corollary: a desire to have actually been invaded so that one could – gloriously – resist. And not just resist but, in the ultimate apotheosis of masochism, die. Part of the allure of romantic anti-imperial nationalism is martyrdom. The executed leaders of the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, for example, stand as resonant examples of the potency of the myth of blood sacrifice. But in the ironic reversal of zombie imperialism, the appropriation of the imagery of resistance to a former colonising power, this romance of martyrdom is mobilized as defiance of the EU.In his anguished complaint about the vitiating effects of membership of the common market in 1977, Enoch Powell lamented: “The breath which condemns submission to laws this nation has not made condemns submission to scales of value which this nation had not willed. To both sorts of submission I ascribe the haunting fear, which I am sure I am not alone in feeling, that we, the British, will soon have nothing left to die for. That was not a slip of the tongue. What a man lives for is what a man dies for, because every bit of living is a bit of dying. Patriotism is to have a nation to die for, and to be glad to die for it – all the days of one’s life.” This takes martyrdom to new levels of self-annihilating fantasy: death in the anti-EU resistance is not a fate or even an act. It is a daily pleasure.The anti-Europe campaign in 1975 very consciously evoked the language of wartime resistance. The Common Market Safeguards Campaign published a newspaper called Resistance News, and the group of MPs around the leading Tory leaver, Neil Marten, was known as the “R” Group – R for resistance. During the war, Marten had been dropped into both France and Norway to work with the resistance movements, so presumably his followers could think of themselves operating behind enemy lines in deepest Dorset. All of this is much more ’Allo, ’Allo! than Army of Shadows – tragedy played out the second time as farce. But, in what would become the camp sitcom of Brexit, that would not diminish its force.Europe’s role in this weird psychodrama is entirely pre-scripted. It does not greatly matter what the European Union is or what it is doing – its function in the plot is to be a more insidious form of nazism. This is important to grasp, because one of the key arguments in mainstream pro-Brexit political and journalistic discourse would be that Britain had to leave because the Europe it had joined was not the Europe it found itself part of in 2016. In Andrew Gilligan’s formulation on the 40th anniversary of British accession in the  in 2012, “the British people joined, and were happy to join, a common market. They did not sign up to a social chapter, a single currency or any moves down the road to a superstate.” Or as Boris Johnson put it in September 2017, the “post-imperial future” was “sold to the people purely as a common market, a way of maximising trade”. But “then came the gradual realisation that this was a very different agenda, an attempt not just at economic but political integration of a kind that the British people had never bargained for.” In itself, this is no more than usually mendacious – the truth being that “ever closer union” was always an explicit part of what the British signed up to in 1973 and voted for in 1975.What matters, though, is the way it misses the point. The idea of Europe as a soft-Nazi superstate was vividly present in 1975, even when the still-emerging EU had a much weaker, less evolved and less intrusive form. The imaginary existential struggle between the gallant English Resistance and the Euroreich was already being played out in one part of English consciousness. It was not a product of the ways in which the nine-member Common Market became the 28-member European Union. It was a product of England’s deeply ided and strangely unsettled relationship to the second world war and what it meant.Yet what brings these disparate modes together is the lure of self-pity, the weird need to dream England into a state of awful oppression. If we return to Nicholas Ridley’s rant, the striking thing is the way it wishes Britain back into wartime: “I’d rather have the shelters and the chance to fight back.” This suggests that what Britain was experiencing in the 1990s at the hands of the EU was actually worse than the war of 1939–45 in which it triumphed. And what could be worse than winning the war? Only losing it. Ridley’s conjuring of the EU as a “German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe” evokes a worse kind invasion than that in Deighton’s SS-GB: invasion by stealth. The suggestion is that a physical invasion by the Nazis would have been preferable to the membership of the EU which achieved the same ends by more cunning and dishonourable means. At least the Nazis could have been, in Churchill’s great and galvanic rhetoric, fought on the beaches, hills, fields and streets. They offered the “chance to fight back”.The new German invasion, cloaked in the guise of peaceful cooperation, is more damnable because it does not give the English Resistance a proper physical target. Hostility to the EU thus opens the way to a bizarre logic in which a Nazi invasion would have been, relatively speaking, welcome. This is a deeply strange kind of displacement – a victor learning to think like the vanquished. But it makes a kind of sense. On the one hand, as the white paper on entry to the common market emphasised in 1971, the experience of not being invaded was one of the genuinely distinctive things about being British: “Our physical assets and our economy had suffered less disastrously than those of other western European countries as a result of the war: nor did we suffer the shock of invasion. We were thus less immediately conscious of the need for us to become part of the unity in Europe.”Yet the paper went on to contrast the fate of Britain since the war with that of the six members of the existing common market, all of whom had been invaded: “The contrast between their experiences in recent years as members of the Communities, and ours outside, when our resources have not been growing sufficiently to do all we should like to do at home and abroad, suggests that they chose the right road … All the Community countries enjoyed rates of growth of gross national product (GNP) per head of population, or of private consumption per head, roughly twice as great as Britain’s.” It was not entirely ridiculous at some subliminal level to see these two things – being invaded and growing twice as fast as the country that wasn’t – as cause and effect. The “right road” to prosperity did not seem to lie through successful self-defence – on the contrary, invasion worked well for the six.Britain was genuinely in a topsy-turvy situation, the winner that had been surpassed by the losers. Why not draw a topsy-turvy conclusion: in a dark stratum of the reactionary mind, we must think of ourselves as a defeated nation? And if Britain was to be defeated, the EU must be its invasive oppressor. Must be, because there was no other possible candidate. The very absurdity of this notion was its strength. The paranoiac must at some stage ask himself: but why are they out to get me? Since there was no actual evidence of any western European hostility, the answer must lie in some deeply hidden motivation. How could they hate us when we saved them in the war? The proto-Brexiteers came up with a counter-factual truth that was at the same time highly satisfying: they hate us because we saved them.Since the English mood in relation to joining Europe was largely one of surrendering to necessity, it was not so hard to think of the act as surrender full stop. In the literary journal Encounter’s 1971 symposium on whether the UK should join the common market, for example, Sir William Hayter, warden of New College, Oxford, and former British ambassador to Moscow, looked back on his contribution to its debates almost a decade earlier: “in 1962 I wrote that ‘in a few years we shall have to make an unconditional surrender to get in’. I am afraid those few years have gone by, and now it is not even certain that an unconditional surrender will get us in.” Peter Shore MP, the most persistent Labour party critic of Europe, during the 1975 referendum took up this theme: “What the advocates of membership are saying … is that we are finished as a country that the long and famous story of the British nation and people has ended that we are now so weak and powerless that we must accept terms and conditions, penalties and limitations almost as though we had suffered defeat in a war.” It was a masochistic rhetoric that would return in full force as the Brexit negotiations failed to produce the promised miracles.This is an edited extract from Heroic Failures: Brexit and the Politics of Pain by Fintan O’Toole, published on 22 November by Head of Zeus, and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5570d5326d01f64e62a67252e589bcf9cb8bd891/271_0_2930_1759/master/2930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57a730b70daf76c5d4400279522b9127","title":"ireland to remain open door to uk for eu citizens post brexit","story":"Withdrawal deal says UK will respect Irish EU membership and keep common travel areaIreland will remain an open door to the UK for EU citizens after Brexit with no mandatory passport checks on those who travel to Britain via Dublin and Belfast, it has been confirmed.After Brexit, EU citizens not already settled in the UK will be subject to immigration rules but will be able to travel to Britain via Ireland and Northern Ireland uninhibited.This is because the withdrawal deal states the UK will respect Ireland’s continued membership of the EU and its freedom of movement rules while at the same time keeping the common travel area (CTA), which has allowed British and Irish citizens to move freely between each others’ countries since 1922.This means EU citizens, who after Brexit will be classified as third-country immigrants in the UK, will be able to travel to Dublin and on to Belfast and take a domestic flight or ferry to Britain without passport checks.The revelation came as tensions over the future of Northern Ireland intensified, with the Democratic Unionist party MP Sammy Wilson claiming the withdrawal deal was a “punishment beating”.Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, criticised Wilson’s comments, saying: “That kind of language doesn’t help anyone and reminds us of a time we are moving away from.” Ireland has made a strategic decision to stay out of the fray over the Brexit deal, and Coveney told members of the Irish parliament it would be wrong to try to influence events in Westminster.The UK Home Office says the UK and Ireland will maintain a high level of cooperation on border security to ensure legitimate travel is facilitated while those who intend to abuse the arrangements are prevented from entering.However, it is far from the once-mooted scenario where Dublin border officials would have provided the British with details of immigration as a first filter to potential onward travel to Britain.Under the withdrawal agreement, family members of EU citizens will also be free to travel to Ireland unimpeded as part of the routine freedom of movement rules.Sources stress that simple freedom of travel does not equate to rights to jobs or social benefits, and point out that the UK would still have control over immigration through controls in the workplace and welfare regime.The Home Office said: “As is the case now, people will be able to enter the UK from Ireland without passing through a routine immigration control. However, they are nonetheless always required to meet the UK’s immigration requirements.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11f2bfd59c548e24b0ddbf99d7358bb06bc1eb08/0_7_4297_2578/master/4297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9db8bd2f374eea5490ec891ee80a8fc","title":"brexit deal theresa may takes agreement to parliament politics live","story":"Prime minister holds press conference after resignations and tough questions from MPs in the CommonsWe’re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading. Here’s a summary of the evening’s events:For a summary of Theresa May’s speech from earlier this afternoon, read here. And you can read the full round-up of the day’s political news here:The former government minister, James Duddridge, suggests the number of letters required to trigger a vote may already have been reached as the Tory MP, Adam Holloway, becomes the latest to submit one.Duddridge, who sent in his own call to the 1922 Committee chairman, Graham Brady, during the Tory conference in October, said:I think I recall Brady said he will give the PM 48 hours notice before going public. We may have hit the 48 letters but no announcement.Here’s a look at some of tomorrow’s front pages – most of which, as one might imagine, lead on the Brexit story. is among those to note that, despite the forces of all political colours now arrayed against her, May fights on:It is perhaps revelatory that papers that usually have opposing viewpoints, particularly on Brexit, follow a similar line. They include the Times and the Financial Times, as well as the Daily  and the :Perhaps most notable is that the Daily Mail, under new management of course, which goes yet further. It attacks the hard Brexiters to whom it used to hand so much positive coverage, who it now accuses of denouncing May’s deal without offering a viable alternative.Moreover, it says that – beyond a hard Brexit and no Brexit at all – there is no viable alternative:In a not-dissimilar vein, the I paper and  focus on the fire May is come under from her own side:While the Daily Mirror and City AM both lead on the prime minister’s cricketing sign-off at this afternoon’s press conference:And finally, some might suggest the only paper to get it right is the Daily Star, which leads on a story about Holly Willoughby – giving the day’s Brexit news no more than a bottom corner slot:Theresa May has met Gibraltar’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, at Downing Street to discuss the Brexit plan this evening. A Downing Street spokesman has said:They commended the hard work of negotiating teams and the constructive discussions that have taken place with Spain and the European Union to ensure that important mutual interests are protected, and new opportunities are enabled for all.In particular, the prime minister and chief minister welcomed the conclusion of a protocol on Gibraltar that forms an integral part of the draft withdrawal agreement and will provide certainty to citizens and businesses in Gibraltar and the surrounding area.The leaders agreed that these arrangements reflected the determination of all parties to move forward in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation.Two leading Brexiter MPs, David Davis and Owen Paterson, have attacked Theresa May’s proposed EU withdrawal agreement at an event in Washington DC.Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said the withdrawal agreement proposed by the prime minister was “a very poor deal”, while Paterson said it was “so bad it cannot be allowed to proceed.”Speaking at the Heritage Foundation, a neoconservative thinktank, the men – who were joined by Shanker Singham of the rightwing Institute for Economic Affairs thinktank – complained that the deal effectively prevented the UK from having an independent trade policy and striking trade deals with other countries.“This is the greatest tragedy of this deal: it takes a country that could have been a major player in solving global problems, and it makes it completely irrelevant,” said Singham.Davis predicted that May’s deal would be voted down by parliament, and that the UK would then have to return to EU negotiators and request further concessions. Both Davis and Paterson said leaving without any deal would be preferable to parliament agreeing to May’s proposal.Davis conceded that “there may be a hiccup or two in the first year if we have a no deal outcome”, but argued that the EU would rapidly agree a free trade deal with the UK because it would be in both countries’ interests to do so.The former Brexit secretary has previously predicted incorrectly that the UK would rapidly agree a series of free trade deals following Brexit.A report suggests the arch-Brexiter, Michael Gove, has turned down the Brexit secretary job. It had been said his price for taking it would have been renegotiation of the draft agreement.Gove is currently the environment secretary.It appears Penny Mordaunt’s support for a free vote on the Brexit deal is being briefed out in Westminster this evening:The Welsh secretary, Alun Cairns, has warned pro-Brexit Conservative backbenchers they run the risk of leaving the UK within the EU if they oppose Theresa May’s plan.The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, who appeared at an event alongside Cairns this evening, refused to speak to journalists after earlier batting away suggestions he might resign over the draft EU withdrawal agreement.The two ministers hosted a Board of Trade meeting at Swansea University, during which Cairns said the government’s lack of a Commons majority meant any successor to May would find it equally hard to satisfy all parties. He added:Changing the prime minister doesn’t change the arithmetic of parliament. So, therefore, colleagues need to accept the context in which we’re working.I would say to the hardliner Leavers who want to leave without a deal that they run the risk of not having a Brexit.And I would say to the ones who are Remainers who want to ignore the outcome of the referendum that they’re running the risk of leaving without a deal, which is the worst that each side would want.Cairns admitted the draft agreement was a “compromise”, and described the “backstop” plan to prevent a hard border in Ireland as a “negative” aspect.My colleague, David Pegg, is keeping an eye on the Heritage Foundation’s Brexit conference, where two Brexit-supporting former government ministers – David Davis and Owen Paterson – have been among those offering their thoughts:There has been some talk in Westminster about Michael Gove’s whereabouts but my colleague, Heather Stewart, has this:Here’s the full text of Corbyn’s email to Labour members (emphasis his):The government is falling apart before our eyes. Their half-baked deal has unravelled, the prime minister has lost all authority and is clearly incapable of delivering a Brexit deal that commands even the support of her Cabinet - let alone parliament and the people of our country.Our party conference agreed that this deal would be judged against our six tests, and if it failed to meet them we would vote against it.After two years of bungled negotiations, the government has produced a botched deal that breaches the prime minister’s own red lines, does not meet our six tests and will leave the country in an indefinite halfway house without a real say.As I said in parliament earlier today, people around the country will be feeling anxious about the industries they work in, the jobs they hold and the stability of this country.We do not accept that the choice is between the government’s deal and ‘no deal’. We will work across parliament to stop a ‘no deal’ outcome. Labour has set out our alternative plan for a sensible Brexit that would work for all of our nations and regions, bring parliament and the country together, support jobs and our economy and guarantee rights, standards and protections.If parliament votes down this shambolic Tory deal – as seems likely – this will represent a loss of confidence in the government. In those circumstances, the best outcome for the country is an immediate general election that can sweep the Tories from power and deliver the Labour government this country desperately needs.If we cannot get a general election, in line with our conference policy, we will support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.We are ready to lead, ready to deliver a sensible deal that works for all our regions and nations and ready to build a Britain that works for the many, not the few.Jeremy CorbynLeader of the Labour PartyThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has written to party members this evening, talking up the possibility of a general election if Theresa May cannot get her deal through parliament – “as seems likely”. And one line stands out in particular:If we cannot get a general election, in line with our conference policy, we will support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.So, Corbyn is being explicit with members: He will back another referendum if he cannot force a general election.Now, that was clearly the case at conference this autumn – as Corbyn rightly points out in his email. But there were some concerns among remain-supporting Labour members about whether or not he really did back that after he told Der Speigel at the weekend that “we can’t stop” Brexit.The rumour mill had suggested Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, was considering resigning. So, her arrival at Number 10 shortly after the prime minister’s press conference caused some eyebrows to be raised in expectation.No need, according to the Daily ’s chief political correspondent, Christopher Hope:The Lib Dems, perhaps unsurprisingly, are giving short shrift to Theresa May’s defence of her Brexit plan this evening. The party’s leader, Vince Cable, says:The prime minister took a long time to say nothing this afternoon. She appears to be in denial.The facts haven’t changed. There is no majority in Parliament for her deal, and she has rightly conceded that ‘No Brexit’ is the real alternative to it. There must now be a people’s vote to break the deadlock and get the country out of this mess.Little known fact about Theresa May she has an exceptionally good memory. She can “read a full statement and repeat it almost verbatim”, Philip Cowley and Dennis Kavanagh write in their definitive account of the 2017 general election. “As one of her team noted: ‘She reads it through once, it’s an almost photographic memory. And I mean word-for-word, not paraphrasing.’”You saw that in action today. There were at least two lines that May used in her answers that sounded pre-scripted, and that she used twice. First, there was: “Am I going to see this through? Yes.” And then there was the spiel how she would be doing her job (negotiating a Brexit deal) and that after that it would be up to MPs to do their job (pass the wretched thing).As news lines, these don’t really take us us very far. The first is little more than a slogan, although at least it quashes, for the moment, any speculation that May is going to stand down. The second sheds a bit more light on the strategy she might use to get her deal through parliament MPs will be told it is their national duty to approve the deal, with the implication that if they vote it down, they will be held responsible for the catastrophe that will follow. What is curious about May, and probably a huge weakness, is her reluctance to take on the arguments of her opponents. She made a modest attempt to explain the need in the Brexit process to accept difficult compromises. But on a day when her Brexiter opponents have been dominating the airwaves, she made no attempt to berate them for the multiple fake promises they made during the EU referendum campaign, despite being given an open invitation to do so. (See 5.35pm.) You can’t win an argument unless you’re willing to tell your opponents they’re wrong. But she won’t. It is as if somehow she has internalised the Brexiter mindset.What rescued the press conference was her Geoffrey Boycott answer to the final question, which she delivered so well that it could have been staged (although I don’t think it was.) (See 5.52pm.) It made for polished TV, and was about as good a clip as May has ever delivered. But it is still just a slogan.

The answer to that question might in part be down to your genes, research suggests.Scientists say a genetic predisposition to perceiving the bitterness of particular substances appears to nudge us towards one beverage or the other.Dr Marilyn Cornelis, co-author of the research from Northwestern University in Illinois, said: “The study adds to our understanding of factors determining beverage preferences – taste, in particular – and why, holding all other factors constant, we still see marked between-person differences in beverage preference as well as the amount we consume.” The study, published in the Scientific Reports journal, involved two sets of data. The first was a large twin study which showed that, at least in those of European ancestry, particular genetic variants are linked to the strength of perception of different tastes: one specific variant was associated with slightly higher ratings of bitterness for caffeine, another to greater bitterness for quinine and a third to greater bitterness for a drug known as propylthiouracil, or prop.The team then looked at data from another source: the UK Biobank, a research endeavour that recruited hundreds of thousands of participants aged 37 to 73 between 2006-10 and involved the collection of genetic data as well as health information, including answers to the question of how many cups of different drinks participants consumed each day.Because our genes are fixed at conception, and our genetic variation can be thought of as random, they allow scientists to explore a sort of “natural experiment”, meaning they can look beyond many of the social or environmental factors that can muddy the waters of our hot drink habits.The team found people with a greater genetic predisposition to perceiving the bitterness of caffeine drank a little more coffee, but an increased perception of the bitterness of quinine and prop were linked to a small reduction in coffee drinking.The reverse patterns were seen when the team looked at the genetic variants and how much tea participants drank.The team also found that greater perception of the bitterness of prop was linked to a lower chance of being a heavy drinker of alcohol.While the study has limitations, including that it relied on self-reporting of tea and coffee drinking, the team say it could help shed light on which cuppa we prefer.“Given humans generally avoid bitter tastes, we interpret these findings as possibly a learned behaviour: if we can perceive caffeine well we associate this with the psychostimulant properties of caffeine and so seek more coffee,” said Cornelis.Cornelis said the findings for tea were harder to explain, but might in part be down to heavy coffee drinkers tending to be very light tea drinkers.Ong added the findings for tea might be down to tea containing lower concentrations of bitter substances, meaning it might prove more acceptable than coffee to those with heightened perception of bitterness.“Our taste genes partially play a role in how much coffee, tea or alcohol we drink,” he said. “The preference towards tea can be seen as a consequence of abstaining from coffee, because our genes might have made coffee a little too bitter for our palates to handle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83e122bc121f756a1a3f57debcf3f54017f44106/254_0_1667_1000/master/1667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c457bc459af0f5dec939dcd06f870442","title":"the lazy zombies guide to youth a radio course with the power to change lives","story":"A new course from ŠKODA is giving young adults a chance to explore their creativity, voice their feelings and expand their skillsOnce home to countless giants of broadcasting, Manchester’s Granada Studios is now a training ground for a new generation. Though the telly sets are long gone, it remains the home of Reform Radio, an online station that also acts as an incubator for young people interested in a career on the airwaves.And if getting ahead in creative industries means subverting expectations, it’s clear the latest batch of students are off to a good start. Huddled around mixing desks and microphones, the show they’re workshopping is called The Lazy Zombies’ Guide to Youth – a sardonic riff on the perceived lack of motivation and creative energy often attributed to the digital generation.They arrived on Monday with little to no relevant experience by the end of the week they’ll produce and present the show to a gathered audience of friends and family. A project from ŠKODA in partnership with The Prince’s Trust as part of the former’s Driver’s Seat Initiative – which aims to celebrate independently minded people who want to make a positive difference to the world – it’s open to 16-25-year-olds who are not in education or employment. That’s a fairly broad window of eligibility, so what drives participants to get involved?For Rhys Forteau, 19, it’s about generating a creative spark. “I think that doing something creative helps you understand yourself a bit better – you find new sides to yourself, and that gives you more motivation,” he says. “My mum wanted me to be a care assistant. I did a bit of training and I enjoyed it at first, but it’s not something I could see myself doing in five years’ time. This course has shown me I can make my own opportunities, not just follow in others’ footsteps.”Along with independent thought, another trait in no short supply among the group is tenacity. Jacob Bowen and Sophie Heng-Travis, both 24, have worked in a number of jobs since graduating with qualifications in creative fields, though both feel they have yet to realise their full potential. For them, the course is an opportunity to widen their skillsets and meet similarly ambitious people.“For me it’s about building my toolkit,” says theatre graduate Bowen. “It’s alright doing filler jobs for a while, but I graduated three years ago. It gets a bit tedious.”Writer and poet Heng-Travis agrees, and suggests it’s a lack of persistence that leads to a lot of young people falling short of achieving their dreams. “I think for some people our age, it’s sad that you have to settle and just do something that’s not what you want to do. But you have to make money and be part of the system, which can mean doing something that’s mediocre. That’s what I find frustrating. But you’ve got to be persistent, you’ve got to keep going.”Course tutor Adam Seymour has not only seen the effect the course has had on countless young people – he’s also a living, breathing testament to the power of training to change lives. He took a similar course himself as a student two years ago, at a time when mental health issues had been holding him back. “I didn’t have a lot of confidence in my own abilities,” says Seymour. “I needed a bit of a boost, a safe space, I needed people around me who were in the same boat, because sometimes when you’re suffering with anxiety and depression and other wellbeing issues, it’s hard to reach out to people.”Seymour’s experience suggests it’s not simply inidual qualities, but rather a joint mentality of determination, and a willingness to collaborate, that’s the key to making the most of a course like this. Bowen agrees: “Having a platform where we can use that fire in our belly, from all the things that are going on with today’s youth, is massively, massively important. It’s about getting together with a few different people from different backgrounds, being on a level playing field and having something to say.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe65b87703bc20d82471bd0973fbb747ddce33b/424_137_1053_632/master/1053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a5d6d90abb53b06b0c38d325c1d324","title":"why young creatives are choosing theatre over digital mediums","story":"Theatre may not seem like the natural medium of young people, but a creative course from ŠKODA is finding that plenty of aspiring young people are keen to get a start in the craftGathered in a studio space within Birmingham Repertory Theatre are a group of people who have either discovered an incredible anti-ageing product, or are bucking a serious trend. According to audience-monitoring charity Audience Agency, younger people are in such short supply at the theatre that the typical crowd’s average age is 52 years old. This lot, it seems, are the exceptions.The group are taking a week-long theatre course that’s part of ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative, which works in partnership with the Prince’s Trust, to give people aged 16–25 not in education or employment a leg-up. The initiative includes starter courses in all sorts of digitally-focused creative industries that you might expect the younger generation to opt for instead of fusty old theatre, so what’s the allure of this most analogue of mediums?“It’s an evolving art form, which fascinates me,” says 21-year-old Freddie Apperly. “What’s considered the norm of theatrical practices today, could be old school and prehistoric in 20 years’ time.” Considering the proliferation of immersive theatre, and the cross-pollination of mediums evident in entertainment such as Secret Cinema and escape rooms, it’s hard to disagree with him.For Laurie Weston, 22, a grounding in theatre is the ideal way to pick up transferable skills. “It’s a great way to learn collaboration and teamwork,” he says. “You’ve got actors who bounce off each other, then you’ve also got people who design the set, sound and lighting who all have to work closely together to get the cues right.”To other young people, the very fact that theatre isn’t a primarily digital medium is all part of the appeal. “Curiosity drove me because I just wanted to know how it works,” says 18-year-old Harry Bell, who’s keen to get backstage to find out more about sound and lighting. “I went to see Chicago with school – now, I can’t remember a thing about Chicago, but I just remember thinking: ‘How are they getting those actors’ voices from there to my ears?’ I wanted to know how it worked, the acoustics of the theatre, I wanted to understand that.”As well as a reputation for appealing to older generations, theatre also carries an image of inaccessibility and elitism at a grassroots level. And while today’s would-be thesps are well aware of the barriers to entry, it seems these are not enough to put them off. For 20-year-old Danni Manley, it just means being more selective about the doors you try to shove your foot in. “I went to apply for drama schools, but you have to pay to audition and I couldn’t afford them all, so I only did two out of three,” she says. “It’s quite annoying. It doesn’t put me off, it just makes it harder.”Bell, for one, is taken by a medium that offers an alternative to the polished, nipped and tucked output of most digital media consumed through a screen. “With theatre, you can’t really fix anything in post,” he says. “You have to get it right, there and then. That’s definitely something I want to do, without a doubt in my mind.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36499f0240324c372cebdc13a7012790a4cb25e0/26_0_3601_2161/master/3601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7fdb50509a35e171f1fa24e1201dd02","title":"davis cup atp cup merge tennis","story":"Tennis might be fighting for its soul but Roger Federer remains its beating heart.On a day when it was learned that a merger of the revamped 118-year-old Davis Cup and the new ATP Cup – which will be held within six weeks of each other at the end of next year and the beginning of 2020 – is one solution being considered to break the impasse that has gripped the sport for five years, the Swiss cruised into the semi-finals of the ATP Tour Finals for the 15th time.He needed to win only five games against Kevin Anderson to move within two wins of lifting the trophy for a seventh time but he found another gear to win 6-4, 6-3 in an hour and a quarter. All of the matches in this tournament have been quick, some sadly so. This was a good match, but hardly memorable.Federer might yet have to get past the world No 1 Novak Djokovic on Saturday to reach the final, knowing his old adversary has stopped him here three times in the past, but his game is in sound shape.He makes his mistakes elegantly, moving on from a slightly skewed backhand to a cool, crisp forehand thrash as if swatting flies. And there were enough of those to put away last night to get him over the line.Victory put Federer top of group Guga Kuerten, so the only way he avoids a semi-final against Djokovic is if the Serb loses to Marin Cilic on Friday and John Isner beats Alexander Zverev.“I’m very happy,” he said. When isn’t he? Perhaps when wrestling with self-doubt after struggling with a hand injury that struck at the start of the grasscourt season, but there was no sign of physical inconvenience here.Other statistics will record that he made 14 unforced errors – 10 of them in a slightly nervy second set – but overall the performance had an air of flawlessness about it.Federer broke Anderson to love for 4-3 after 24 minutes and again without conceding a point in the ninth game – yet in between dropped his own serve. He double-faulted in giving up three break points but still held to secure the set. This was carefree, get-out-of-gaol tennis, entertaining and full of rich, expansive strokes. No wonder there were occasional mistakes from both sides of the net.He and Anderson were now in the semi-finals. All that needed to be determined was who would finish top of the group – and then the mathematical fun would start. As so often, it was Federer.The match meandered to an almost mundane conclusion, pleasant and pretty enough but without the requisite tension to command serious attention. Federer squandered two match points before breaking the big serve of the South African for a second time in the set to close it out.Elsewhere, there were waves on Planet Tennis. At an amicable meeting in London on Tuesday night, the Association of Tennis Professionals and the International Tennis Federation came closer than they have ever been to resolving their differences.However, while a merger of their rival Cups would be hugely popular with players torn between loyalty to their national teams and the lure of another cash-rich tournament with ranking points, an insider at the meeting said: “It is a definite possibility down the line but there is a bit of work to do to get there.”The stumbling block is the fact the ITF handed over stewardship of the Davis Cup to the Kosmos company run by Gerard Pique for $3bn (£2.35bn) over 25 years, so the ATP have to negotiate with the Barcelona star rather than the federation, and Pique is still learning about the internal politics of tennis.It was striking at the ATP launch of their event here on Thursday that the new venture has the backing of all the world’s best players, while the future of the Davis Cup – played for national pride but no money or points – remains the game’s Brexit conundrum: to remain or to leave. So much tennis, so little time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a71bb98868f1f29aa34efa816ab64c5702e2ab8c/0_643_5114_3069/master/5114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fff7b0c739aba68785796cfd69cfe823","title":"world chess championship game five magnus carlsen fabiano caruana","story":"Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana played to a fifth draw in as many games on Thursday in the latest episode of their world championship showdown in London, as the Norwegian champion adroitly weathered early fireworks to negotiate a peaceful result after 34 moves and three-and-a-quarter hours.Caruana, playing with the white pieces, led with a Rossolimo (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6), marking the third time in a week the players opened with the Sicilian variation. The American was first to deviate with 4. O-O, then prompted gasps with 6. b4!?, a highly aggressive move offering a pawn sacrifice with the hope of creating pressure and confusion and, ideally, winning chances in the long term.The challenger settled into a comfortable position, but Carlsen was able to escape from immediate danger shortly after (10. Bxa1 d6 11. bxc5 Ne7 12. Qe2 b4 13. Qc4). Caruana played at an incredible pace during the first act, taking no longer than 66 seconds to complete any of his opening 13 moves, demonstrating a formidable depth of preparation.The American required more than 31 minutes before settling on 19. Bc3, taking extra care to not squander whatever advantage remained from his opening surprise – even if the computers indicated a level and drawish position by that point. No real progress was made over the next hour and the players shook hands after another bloodless draw.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes.

But I couldn’t find a way to push it.”The general thinking was that Caruana faced extra pressure on Thursday as white. That’s because Carlsen, who won the draw and elected to play Game 1 as black, will get to play back-to-back contests on Friday and Sunday as white under the regulations, which dictate the rotation of the colors is reversed at the midpoint of the match.He added: “I can only play for a win if I get something and I can only really be disappointed that I missed a chance if I get some sort of chance in the game. And if a game is like this where we both play more or less correctly and neither of us makes a serious mistake, I don’t think that I can really be disappointed.”Carlsen admitted he was looking forward to consecutive games as white.“It’s like any round-robin tournament,” the Norwegian champion said. “If you have a double black or a double white, you kind of single that out when the tournament starts. That is either your opportunity to strike or when you’re at your most vulnerable. I am looking forward to it, obviously, and we’ll see what happens.“But most of all I’m just more or less happy with the way things are going with black as it’s clear to the naked eye there is serious room for improvement at this point.”Thursday’s contest took place two days after the apparent bombshell intel blunder that’s threatened to overshadow the match itself, where a short video clip revealing confidential details of Caruana’s preparation was uploaded to the Saint Louis Chess Club’s YouTube channel before it was quickly taken down, but not before crucial screen shots were captured and disseminated on social media.The footage included pictures of an open laptop with a list of openings allegedly researched by the world No 2 along with the identities of three grandmasters – Leinier Domínguez, Alejandro Ramírez and Ioan-Cristian Chirila – who could potentially be working as seconds in the challenger’s camp.Speculation over whether it was a ghastly error by Caruana’s club or a deliberate misinformation campaign intended to spread false intelligence to the Carlsen camp have swirled since the video entered the public domain.NRK reported on Thursday that while Carlsen was aware of the video’s existence ahead of Tuesday’s fourth game (though he hadn’t seen it), Caruana’s team opted to wait until after play ended to inform the American of the development, lest it interfere with his mental state.“They must have assumed that he was unable to handle this shortly before the game,” Norwegian international master Torstein Bae told the network. “Then they think they should give it to him afterwards. It must also mean that the information is not so crucial.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52c32c7ea89b49ee6b93baa1c1478595d167b32d/281_0_4291_2575/master/4291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae38e2c5b0f51b306b7b42bf9b2bf04a","title":"talking horses cheltenhams autumn meeting puts jumping at centre stage","story":"Grand National and three-time Festival winner Tiger Roll will be present at a meeting that often unearths top-class talentIt is 196 days since the first race of the 2018-19 National Hunt season, but there will still be a sense of a new beginning as racegoers assemble below Cleeve Hill for the first day of Cheltenham’s November meeting on Friday afternoon. For the next four-and-a-half months, jumping is centre-stage and there is a good chance that at least one of next spring’s Grade One championship winners will be lurking somewhere on Friday’s card.One certainty is that there will be a Grand National winner on the cast-list, as Tiger Roll, who held on by a fast-diminishing head at Aintree back in April, returns to the scene of his third Cheltenham Festival success in the Cross-Country eight months ago. When it comes to the current season, though, it is two of Friday’s novice events which are likely to prove most significant.The Steel Plate \u0026amp Sections Novice Chase is a race that needs little introduction, as it is one of the longest-standing sponsorships in the sport, reminding racegoers where they should go if they ever need a girder for 30 years. It has also been highlighting top-class future winners throughout that time, right back to a famous renewal in January 1989 when Waterloo Boy picked up the pieces after Beech Road fell at the last. In the space of an hour at the Festival meeting a couple of months later, Waterloo Boy took the Arkle Trophy and Beech Road landed the Champion Hurdle. The race has been on a roll in recent seasons too, with four of the last seven winners – Taquin Du Seuil, Finian’s Oscar, Dynaste and Grands Crus – going on to win a Grade One chase that season, and the seven-strong field for the latest renewal looks very much up to par. Nicky Henderson has two live contenders in Jenkins and Mr Whipped, who were both rated in the mid-to-high 140s over timber, while Jerrysback, twice a winner over hurdles in 2016-17, returns from a 633-day absence with an unbeaten record over jumps to defend. White Moon, though, is arguably the most interesting runner in the field as he returns to the track for the first time since finishing last of seven in a Grade Two hurdle at Sandown almost a year ago. He went to post there unbeaten in two starts and apparently one of the big hopes for the spring in the Colin Tizzard stable. His performance was also one of the early signs that the yard was entering a patchy run of form and it would be no surprise to see him fulfilling his potential over fences. This promises to be one of the best non-Graded races this side of the Festival in March, however, and a difficult race to win first time up. As a result, Nigel Twiston-Davies’s Count Meribel (2.25) could prove to offer the value in the race at around 5-1 as he attempts to follow up a debut win over fences at Carlisle. Count Meribel was a great deal busier over hurdles than most of his opponents and needed six starts to record his first success before coming up a little short in Graded company last spring. He could hardly have made a better start in chases, though, as he dominated his 12 opponents under top weight and in a good time. If his fencing around Cheltenham is as accurate as it was at Carlisle, it will put pressure on his opponents to match him and he could prove very difficult to pass.The Grade Two novice hurdle at the end of the card has also been won by some very useful horses in recent years, though some, including Coneygree, the 2015 Gold Cup winner, did not reach their peak until they went chasing. There is no shortage of potential in the nine-runner field but Darlac (3.35) is one of the most unexposed hurdlers in the line-up and was very strong in the market when he made his debut over timber at Fontwell in October. He had finished only seventh on his sole previous start in a bumper, but the money was well-informed and he finished 16 lengths clear of the runner-up. Today’s race, inevitably, is much stronger but Darlac is an exciting prospect and should be good enough to follow up. Tiger Roll may no longer sport a squiggle against his Timeform rating – a sign that the firm’s handicappers think a horse is not entirely trustworthy – and that seems very fair given a career record that now bears comparison with some of the very best. He has always seemed like more of a horse for the spring, however, and a handicap over the cross-country course is a different challenge to the conditions event he took at the Festival. Gordon Elliott’s runner must give at least 7lb to his opponents, including a couple of specialists over this unusual circuit in Bless The Wings and Josies Orders. At the prices, though, it could be worth taking a chance on Charlie Longsdon’s Midnight Shot (3.00) at around 10-1 after an improved performance to win at Carlisle in October, while Dostal Phil (1.15), who travelled notably well when second at Uttoxeter last time, will also go close earlier on the card."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d715695c0cd10962b17cd002627b4d9e0e75e520/0_214_2561_1536/master/2561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d50dab5c0813357dc5dc4e248b85bb","title":"sri lanka v england second test day three live","story":"73rd over: England 310-9 (Foakes 37, Anderson 4) Anderson gets off the mark with a tasty reverse sweep for four!

England are scoring more slowly this session, but the batsmen look pretty comfortable. 68th over: England 295-6 (Root 119, Foakes 33) Why is it that Sri Lanka’s whites are so much whiter than England’s? Is this a deliberate sartorial decision, or are they using the wrong detergent? Here’s some photographic evidence. The difference really is stark.67th over: England 291-6 (Root 117, Foakes 31) One run from Pushpakumara’s over. Root’s is now sixth on the list of England’s finest in Sri Lanka, with Kevin Pietersen top of the chart with his 151 in 2012. “This is imperious stuff from Root, the player we all know he is, and all the more joyous given the pitch and situation,” writes Guy Hornsby. “Also hugely important that we’re batting at a quick rate, given it’s only Day three. It’s batting for victory, not the hope of victory. Ruthless.”66th over: England 290-6 (Root 116, Foakes 31) Foakes hits through midwicket, and though it’s well fielded near the boundary the batsmen nevertheless manage to run three. Meanwhile the Asterixcricket crossover moment Jim Goldsmith was remembering a few overs back has been uncovered:65th over: England 285-6 (Root 114, Foakes 28) Pushpakumara bowls a beauty, sent down straight and spinning away from the batsman, fortunately for Foakes just past the bat. Meanwhile Phil Russell proposes some other Roman cricketers:Dubaious - not available following match-fixing scandal in the UAE.Moveyourfeetus - All-rounder. Good against the spinners and also handy when it comes to making deliveries. 64th over: England 284-6 (Root 113, Foakes 28) Dananjaya comes on, and sends down some filth which Root clips through midwicket for four, a poor delivery but a delicious shot. 63rd over: England 279-6 (Root 108, Foakes 28) Root mishits a sweep into the air, but having pushed the field back with his free-scoring stylings there’s nobody around to catch it. 62nd over: England 276-6 (Root 106, Foakes 27) Lakmal bowls full and straight at Foakes, who clips it off his ankles and fine for four. 61st over: England 269-6 (Root 104, Foakes 22) Pushpakumara changes ends and the 50 partnership comes up, from 85 deliveries. “Catching up on the Asterix names, I always remember the book Asterix and the Magic Carpet, which I think was translated by the late, lamented, Anthea Bell,” writes Jim Goldsmith. “One of the bad guys was called Owzat. From memory, this lead to the gag where they spot him, Asterix shouts ‘Owzat!’ and Obelix quietly replies ‘Not out, I’m afraid.’” 60th over: England 264-6 (Root 103, Foakes 19) Lakmal starts the session, and Root opens the face of his bat and nicks one along the ground, well wide of first slip for four, completing a brilliant century. Is it a match-winning one?The players are back out. Root will be on strike, and two away from his century.England lead by 213 with four second-innings wickets remainingAnd that is tea. It’s been an excellent session for England, and their lead is growing quickly, though none of their bowlers will be particularly encouraged by what they’re seeing. Back in a bit.59th over: England 259-6 (Root 98, Foakes 19) Root has had enough of being stuck in the 90s. He reverse sweeps for a single, and when back on strike hits a delicious shot through midwicket that is brilliantly fielded on the rope and thus yields only two runs. He’ll go into tea still a couple short.58th over: England 254-6 (Root 94, Foakes 18) Two Lakmal overs, two runs. Every other Sri Lanka bowler who has bowled more than four overs (discounting Dhananjaya de Silva, in other words) is bleeding at least 4.4 an over.57th over: England 253-6 (Root 93, Foakes 18) After four dot balls Foakes goes for a sweep and nearly adds another number to today’s most eye-catching statistic as he top-edges powerfully into the skies, but there’s nobody there to catch it!56th over: England 251-6 (Root 93, Foakes 16) Lakmal does his first bowling of the innings, a welcome change of pace55th over: England 250-6 (Root 93, Foakes 15) Dilruwan Perera, the most economical bowler in England’s first innings and the least economical bowler in their second, returns. There’s a loud lbw should against Root, but the ball was certainly clearing the stumps. “Belatedly responding to Ben Heywood’s Asterix-based lunchtime challenge, in the absence of any suitable Roman players, could I suggest Gotitinforus and Triggafingus as the Castor and Pollux of umpiring twins to be avoided?” I think you probably could. 54th over: England 247-6 (Root 92, Foakes 13) Three runs from Pushpakumara’s over takes England’s lead beyond 200.53rd over: England 244-6 (Root 91, Foakes 11) Dananjaya bowls, and Root advances to thwack his first delivery straight down the ground for six. That’s a fabulous shot! “Many people are saying (to quote a contemporary personality) that it’s extraordinary that all six wickets have been as a result of attempted sweeps,” notes Ian Forth. “But if all the wickets had come from attempted vertical shots, and England had scored many fewer runs, we wouldn’t think that was extraordinary.”52nd over: England 236-6 (Root 84, Foakes 10) One remarkable delivery from Pushpakumara, which hits something helpful in the pitch, leaps into the air and turns sharply, passing Foakes at almost shoulder height. The next pitches in a very similar spot but does entirely the opposite, keeps straight, bounces low, and Foakes does well to push it to safety. 51st over: England 231-6 (Root 82, Foakes 7) “Sunny here in Istanbul, after filthy cold torrential rain yesterday,” writes Rob Lewis. “Your colleague mentioned that Lakmal hadn’t bowled himself today at all. Could it be that only one wicket has fallen to the quicks in the match so far?” It could indeed, Jennings in the first innings.50th over: England 228-6 (Root 79, Foakes 6) A couple of singles off Pushpakumara’s over, only one of them a sweep. 48th over: England 220-6 (Root 78, Foakes 0) A sedate over from the hitherto expensive Pushpakumara, with Foakes spending the final five-sixths of it carefully getting his eye in. 47th over: England 219-6 (Root 77, Foakes 0) All six wickets to fall in this innings have come from attempted sweeps, four of them lbw. That’s a remarkable statistic.Moeen tries to sweep, misses the ball and the umpire’s finger goes up! The ball looked to have hit him just outside the line, but neither team has any reviews left so he’ll just have to lump it.That’s drinks, which seems like a good time to hand things over to Simon Burnton for the rest of the day. Be kind to him, and send your emails to Simon.Burnton@the, and tweet @Simon_Burnton46th over: England 218-5 (Root 76, Moeen 10) As Root again advances and smears a six between mid-wicket and long-on, once again we wonder why Lakmal hasn’t given himself an over or two, just for the sake of change really. Is he injured? Too modest? Has low self-esteem so just assumes he’ll be rubbish? He needs to try something, because England have scored 87 in the hour since lunch, the lead is 172 and the run rate for the innings is creeping towards five an over. 45th over: England 208-5 (Root 67, Moeen 9) A rare beast, as Root skips down and plays a straight drive for four so classic you could get a first from Oxford in it. “In response to Ben Heywood’s challenge,” responds Tim Sanders, “the Romans could select Circus Maximus if he’s not too busy as a six-hitting mercenary in the various global T20 competitions. If he can find protective equipment in the right size, Biggus Dickus has to play.”44th over: England 202-5 (Root 62, Moeen 8) Root does a little dance (but resolutely does not make a little love, nor get down tonight) down the pitch and flaps Perera over mid-wicket, only getting a single but that ticks England over the 200 mark. 43rd over: England 199-5 (Root 60, Moeen 7) Akila gets away with a stinky full toss, Root only managing to get a single down to long-on. Now here’s Moeen, who casually slog-sweeps his second ball in front of mid-wicket for six. An extraordinary shot from an extraordinary, if sometimes frustrating player. The noise that hit made, just a little click as it sailed over the boundary, told you he’d nailed it. 42nd over: England 190-5 (Root 58, Moeen 0) Looking at the Buttler wicket again, maybe a bit more credit should be given to Akila, who took lots of pace off the delivery which meant Buttler had to wait for it, give it a bigger swipe and thus came unstuck. Root’s not discouraged from the concept of the reverse sweep though: he hits three in the over, one for a couple, another perfectly-timed in front of point for four, and one more for luck, bringing him a single. 41st over: England 183-5 (Root 51, Moeen 0) “I like the idea of Root’s Edge,” writes John Swan. “Can I suggest Buttler’s Elbow (a nasty turn on a mountain track), Gaffney’s Finger (a column of rock thrusting uncompromisingly into the sky behind Christchurch) and, the ultimate terror for seafarers, Stokes’ Cap.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff8bba8c500347faf78fbf9dbde2c72a31597c0/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e4bc68f35fbeb2e4d31a87677e7670","title":"share your caribbean highlights for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Send us a tip on affordable experiences in the Caribbean, be they places to stay, activities and attractions, or bars and restaurantsPalm-fringed beaches, rum punch and infectious reggae beats … Carnivals, rainforest and a laid-back vibe … The Caribbean is one of the world’s most alluring holiday destinations, and we want to hear your highlights – especially for those not on an A-lister budget.

Now visitors flock to capture images of the fiery sea and skies at duskPeople were running down the beach. Not for exercise but to get into position before the sun slipped below the horizon. I hurried along, swept up by the sense of urgency. Mini tripods were lined up on the sand at the water’s edge, and selfie sticks were held aloft. Groups of friends, silhouetted against the pink sky, were trying to synchronise their star jumps, while women instructed their boyfriends on exactly how to photograph them as they stared into the sea. One woman posed holding her pet dachshund. The entire beach was a mass Instagram shoot.Chichibuga is a 1km-long, pancake-flat sandy strand overlooking the Seto sea on the north coast of Shikuko, the smallest, most rural of Japan’s four main islands. Never heard of it? That’s hardly surprising. Lying between the biggest island, Honshu, with its blockbuster cities (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima) – not to mention stunning alpine landscapes – and the southernmost island of Kyushu (often called the most beautiful), Shikuko is overlooked by international visitors.Those who do come are drawn by either its spiritual heritage – the 88 sacred temples trail is Japan’s most famous pilgrimage – its inland gorges, rivers and waterfalls, or its rugged Pacific coastline. Despite being easily accessible from Honshu – Shikuko’s capital, the port city of Takamatsu, is an hour and 20 minutes’ drive over a causeway bridge from Okayama city – the Seto sea coast is low on the list of visitor attractions, and Chichibuga beach, on the outskirts of unassuming Mitoyo city, even more so. Or it was, until recently.In 2016, the Mitoyo tourism authority ran a photography competition. The winning image showed two children reflected in Chichibuga’s perfectly still, mirror-like water at sunset. It was a dramatic photo and a lightbulb moment for the authorities, who realised the beach was tourism gold.At the same time, Akiyoshi Kuramoto, a tourism authority employee with a passion for photography, became fascinated with the mirror effect, often hashtagging his photos the “Uyuni of Japan” in reference to Bolivia’s shimmering salt flats, another Insta-travel favourite. He posted photos on Mitoyo’s Facebook page, explaining how to get the effect. Kuramoto continued to add to his Instagram feed, attracting increasing numbers of followers he now has 5,600 – not massive in Instagram terms but enough to generate interest beyond his city. This year the beach’s popularity had a further boost when Japanese travel company Jalan named it the best place in Japan to watch the sun set. This summer the beach, which in 2016 attracted a handful of tourists, saw 50,000 visitors in July and August.The day I visited there were four coaches in the car park, but the usually calm Seto sea was choppy and the sky mottled with dark clouds, ruining the glossy mirror effect. A young couple, Kosuke and Yui, told me they had driven four hours from Nara to photograph the beach and eat the region’s famous udon noodles (not at the same time). They were disappointed with the weather but said they’d be back to try again another time – and at least the noodles were good.Kagawa is known for Sanuki noodles (after an old name for its prefecture), with 800 restaurants in the region (100 just in Miyoto), often charging as little as £1.40 a bowl. This month saw the opening of the city’s first “noodle hotel”: Udon House, a cookery school with pod rooms. The man behind Udon House is Hima Furuta, a Japanese entrepreneur who spends half his time in Milan where he founded the Peace Kitchen. Udon House is his take on the Italian agriturismo, a chance to showcase the local food culture. On a typical two-day stay, guests take an udon making class, visit a farmer and join a breakfast tour of local udon restaurants. Chichibuga beach is a short drive from Udon House, so guests will also get a chance to visit the new local highlight.Japan is the most photographed country in Asia, and the second most photographed country in the world. With the Rugby World Cup and the Setouchi Art Triennale taking place in 2019, and new direct flights from London-Osaka starting on 31 March, its popularity is only going to rise. Now, alongside its cities, shrines, bamboo forests, mountains and snow monkeys, regular Instagram users interested in Japan are likely to start seeing a little-known beach bathed in pinks and reds and purples."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7b7c5de6b16c53c52520ff54d4432787be9caa7/77_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48629ea6377dadb029f8cdfa36d20147","title":"elton johns john lewis christmas ad it could have been so different","story":"The retailer’s festive advert has the singer recalling heartwarming memories. What if it had focused on some of the artist’s less endearing moments?The 2018 John Lewis ad is heartwarming. Elton John sits alone at his piano, playing Your Song while moments of his life flash before his eyes. He sings in a stadium, he sings in the studio, he sings in a pub, he sings at a school concert. It’s a very sweet advert with a very simple message: somebody better call Elton John an ambulance right away, because this is exactly the sort of thing that happens right before you die.In fact, the advert is probably too heartwarming. Just a few weeks ago, the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody was heavily criticised for its toothless portrayal of Freddie Mercury’s worst excesses, and the same could be said for the John Lewis advert. Elton John isn’t a great pop star because he sings songs about little dancers, crocodiles that rock and being able to stand up. No, Elton John is a great pop star because he is knotty and complicated and, well, a bit of a dick sometimes.If the John Lewis Christmas ad is going to go down as a lasting tribute to Elton’s career – and, boy, there’s a sentence I never thought I’d write – then it should have picked some better memories for him to have. Luckily for you, I have written a new version. There is still time to make this before Christmas, John Lewis.It is Christmas morning. Elton John sits alone at his piano, wistfully tapping out opening notes of Your Song. He looks old and vulnerable. He blinks. He swallows. Then, as the melody soars beneath his fingers, he drifts into a reverie and is transported to …Las Vegas, March 2018. Elton John is in the middle of his Million Dollar Piano residency, playing Saturday Night’s Alright For Fighting for all it’s worth. But something is troubling him. He leans over to look at an audience member he invited onstage. “Fuck off,” he mouths. Ten seconds later, more aggrieved, he mouths it again, then points angrily, then stops playing, then leaves the stage in a huff. When he returns, he tells the entire audience “You fucked it up”, before he spins away again, lost in a dream.Taiwan, 2004. Elton John’s private plane touches down in Taipei. It’s distant and exotic, just one of many astonishing places that Elton has visited as a direct consequence of his mother scrimping and saving for a piano all those years ago. He is swarmed by photographers, amazed that such a global star is visiting their country. His response? “Rude, vile pigs! Do you know what that means? Rude, vile pigs! That’s what all of you are.” An appalled photographer shouts: “Get out of Taiwan!” To which Elton replies: “We’d love to get out of Taiwan if it’s full of people like you. Pig! Pig!” The strings soar as he is swept even further into a river of nostalgia.New York, March 2000. Elton John becomes upset during a performance of his own musical and storms out.France, 1996. A woman says “Yoo-hoo” to Elton John while he is playing tennis. In response, Elton storms off the court. “I’m never coming to the south of France again,” he seethes.London, the 1980s. After spending the last few days fully awake, Elton John phones one of his employees and angrily orders him to somehow make London less windy.The music now reaches a crescendo, and then …It’s Christmas morning again. Elton finishes playing Your Song and, with a nostalgic tear in his eye, gently shuts the lid. But then he notices the cameraman in his peripheral vision and loses his temper, screaming profanities and flinging vases until the cameraman is forced to escape and flee for his life. Finally, the new slogan appears: “John Lewis. If we can deal with him, we can deal with you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/653d320fa737a2fc52caf08194a002d51c29ebaa/0_130_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71d6577c865f4b1f10a6fa7ecb568cc4","title":"steve pemberton on playing tony martin theres nowhere to hide","story":"After pranking the nation with his live episode of Inside No 9, the comedian is back with a bruising portrayal of the farmer who shot an intruder dead in 1999A man is fitfully asleep in the main bedroom of Bleak House, an isolated cottage in Norfolk. He is awoken in the dead of night and fears he is being burgled. He has been expecting this. He creeps down the stairs – which he himself has partially demolished as a defensive measure – and, in the dark, confronts the intruders. No words are spoken the scared homeowner fires in his general direction. When the smoke clears and dawn breaks, a man lies dead.It sounds like the basis of a slightly lurid fiction – perhaps a brutal mystery dreamt up by the Inside No 9 team. But this was the sequence of events surrounding the death of 16-year-old Fred Barras, who was shot by farmer Tony Martin in 1999. The case became the centre of a fierce debate centred around the subject of reasonable force in defence of one’s person or property. But until now, Martin himself has remained an enigma.To discuss Martin with Pemberton is to sense real sympathy for a stubborn, isolated and vulnerable man. Pemberton admits to having struggled with the early scenes, in which Martin is a closed book, simply refusing to talk about what happened at Bleak House. “After the first interrogation, he spent the night in prison, which would have been very frightening,” Pemberton explains. “He asked for a pen and paper and wrote pages and pages of notes. He clearly stayed up all night and stirred up all these painful memories. In the second interrogation, there was the sense of a dam bursting”.It emerges during the course of the interrogation that Martin’s isolation has been prompted, at least in part, by horrific childhood trauma. “It’s very moving, to hear him talking about the abuse he suffered as a child and how that cast a shadow over the rest of his life,” Pemberton says. “He couldn’t form those personal relationships. There’s a section that had to be cut out of the final film where he explains that he did have a woman back to the cottage for one night and you sense that it was just that one night and then he felt that sense of shame again. It’s very powerful stuff.”Pemberton suggests that audiences will vacillate in their sympathies for Martin throughout the piece. Martin himself appears briefly at the film’s conclusion still blunt, uncompromising and utterly unrepentant. There are no shades of grey black and white are all he appears to recognise.Despite the manifestly horrific subject matter, it is guiltily tempting to draw a parallel with certain moments in Pemberton’s career as a comic actor. Are there grim echoes of The League of Gentlemen in this real-life rural fury? Do isolation and paranoia breed extremity? He is understandably cautious, pointing out that the death of burglar Henry Vincent earlier this year in London’s Hither Green proves that such issues are by no means exclusively rural. But even so, he is not unaware of the similarities. “I wouldn’t want to say it was like a League Of Gentlemen character at all but I do see those parallels.” Viewed from a certain angle, Tony Martin’s story feels nationally resonant simmering, unheard resentment finally exploding with tragic and destructive consequences. Which feels like a fairly apt symbol of where we are now.How does Pemberton feel about his erstwhile colleague Mark Gattis’s recent assertion that The League of Gentlemen was a premonition of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union? “I definitely think it’s a very British trait and we just tapped into that. It had a real resonance and those characters – and the town of Royston Vasey – came to symbolise it,” he says. “When we came to reboot it last year, for the specials, we thought ‘we can’t ignore this now’. So we made it pretty much a feature of what Edward and Tubbs were doing.” So Britain has always been Royston Vasey but it has only just started to fully express that? “Absolutely. God help us!”.Pemberton doesn’t rule out a return to Royston Vasey, perhaps in a post-Brexit dystopia. But he seems happy to let it lie for the foreseeable future and understandably keener to talk about a much more recent triumph. With October’s Inside No 9 special, he and Reece Shearsmith conjured a live TV moment to rank with any in the medium’s history. “We decided that if we were going to do it, the live element would have to be completely integral, so it becomes more of an event than a story,” he says. “It was scary to do – you walk out thinking: ‘my mum’s watching this …’ You start second-guessing everything. I did a very cliched thing at the end which I don’t think I’ve ever done before. I actually punched the air. I was just so relieved that we hadn’t fucked it up. We wanted it to be perfect.”Above all, Pemberton is a student of his medium – a fan as much as a creator. As we finish, he is enthusing about the next series of Inside No 9 “I’d like the new series to go back to basics and just tell good stories. We don’t want to be known as pranksters,” he says. Which brings it round to The Interrogation again. “Forget all the sharp cutting and flash-bang editing. Can you tell a simple story? That’s what our aim always is.”The Interrogation of Tony Martin airs on Channel 4 on Sunday 19 November at 9pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c739a96ffd27c5235163bde6a09f0b67ef64bf/0_35_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbe9c2ad93672369fadf83db9caf0193","title":"beto orourke medium blogpost analysis running","story":"The Texas Democrat published a stream of consciousness Medium post about – what else? – the act of running. Here’s what he said, and what we think he meantAs if the punk band, skateboard and photos of him in a sundress weren’t evidence enough, Beto O’Rourke has solidified his role as the most Gen-X dude alive by dusting off another signifier of the Y2K era: a meandering, hastily proofread blogpost about his feelings.As many have pointed out online, the post about running – possibly a thinly veiled allegory about what’s to come for the exciting Democratic candidate who recently over-performed in his race for a Senate seat against Republican Ted Cruz – reads like the stream of consciousness work of a modernist author.Only it’s, you know, not exactly a towering literary achievement. O’Rourke does have a very creative way of spelling “Massachusettes”, which may be a bit of poetic license.Typically, if this were any other bro in a creative writing class, we wouldn’t bother spending much time parsing the text’s meaning. But considering it’s the work of a man a lot of people think might have a chance to be president someday, we’ll indulge him this time.Here’s what he said, and what we think he meant. As the blogpost opens, we find O’Rourke going about his morning routine, outfitting himself in warm clothing, like a warrior donning his armor, to withstand the harsh reception he is sure to face. From the elements, yes, but also from the political climate. What is he preparing for? A run.Here O’Rourke references the direction from which he is being attacked. From the right side, which is clear enough, and blowing due south, there being few places in the country further south than his home state of Texas. He will come in for a lot more of that in the years to come if he is intending to run for president.His being the first footprints in fresh snow is too sophisticated a metaphor for me to unpack here, sorry.As for “the crazies” line, is this man giving voice to the idea that you’d have to be a glutton for punishment to run against Trump?O’Rourke mentions faces and snow eight and nine times, respectively, throughout, which is clearly a tacit admission he has a cocaine problem. JUST KIDDING. But there does seem to be hidden meaning in the way he describes various figures handling the cold on the most vulnerable part of the body.As he runs toward the Washington Monument – the most iconic symbol of George Washington, the man synonymous with American leadership – he thinks about turning around. Before long he comes across a man who has decided to do just that, shielding his face, as if in weakness, a sign of giving up. The man he sees is the version of himself, having decided he isn’t up to the task.To paraphrase Joyce: “On a snowy winter morning, he is young Beto, a mirror within a mirror, he beholdeth himself, the young figure of then is seen, precious manly, walking on a nipping morning.”Here he sees a third man, not the one turning away, not the one who’s ducked, momentarily as he has, behind the cover of the trees, but one embracing it all, without compunction or caution.Soon he ascends the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a monument dedicated to the man widely considered our greatest president. He reads his words, and describes their effect on his physical body. If the cold is a symbol of the negative throughout, of fear, Lincoln’s words are the opposite: they bring literal warmth to his blood.Quoting Lincoln here, this could mean a lot of things but let’s just go with saying it’s a dig at Cruz, the big religious windbag.If the results of the midterm elections have shown us anything, it’s that the suffering of the Trump era isn’t quite as inevitable as it may have seemed. The winds have changed. As any runner will tell you, running with the wind makes you go a lot faster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5295efc01267ea367048ae77e6342ea4ebe40d0b/0_175_5681_3407/master/5681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b03dcdb23108013bc26905a218d18009","title":"florida recount midterms bush gore","story":"It’s the state ‘where good elections go to die’, says a strategist as recount madness engulfs Florida once againThe judge’s indictment was damning. “We have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election,” the US district judge Mark Walker told a court in Florida on Thursday. “And we chose not to fix this.”The midterm elections took place more than a week ago.

Armies of lawyers flew in from both sides. For five weeks they wrangled over how the ballot papers had been designed. There was the question of what voters intended with punch-card ballots when they only detached a portion of the perforated paper (“hanging chads”) or merely dented instead of removing the punch-out (“dimpled chads”).Another mystery surrounded why people in Democratic strongholds voted for the third party candidate Pat Buchanan, a conservative Christian, rather than Gore. Shrum recalled: “As Buchanan said to me, ‘There were not thousands of Jewish Democrats on the gold coast wanting to vote for me.’”Ron Klein, who was co-chair of the Gore campaign in Florida, elaborated: “The biggest paradox of the whole thing was these large Jewish areas. One of them is called Century Village in Boca Raton: 10,000 older people, call them Roosevelt New Deal Democrats. Pat Buchanan was sort of some version of Donald Trump at an earlier stage.Klein, now a lawyer based in Fort Lauderdale, and colleagues spent weeks camping out at the Broward county election supervisor office. Also on the scene was the self-declared “dirty trickster” Roger Stone, who claims he was one of the organisers of the so-called “Brooks Brothers riot” during the recount, which saw Republican activists chanting outside a meeting of election canvassers. Stone would return with a vengeance to help Donald Trump win Florida and the presidency in 2016.Democrats sued to force a recount in a few counties where they thought it would help them overturn Bush’s narrow margin. The battle went all the way to the supreme court which, in a 5-4 vote, ruled that no alternative method of recount could be established in a timely manner. In effect, this put Bush in the White House.Sidney Blumenthal, an aide to Bill Clinton who was working with Gore’s team, said: “The Republicans didn’t play fair in terms of intimidating vote counters. The Bush v Gore supreme court decision will live in infamy as one of the most twisted decisions ever handed down. There’s no question in my mind that the election was stolen in 2000 with enormous consequences. There’s no telling how different our history would have been.”The alternative timeline remains dizzying: would a President Gore have prevented the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, not invaded Iraq and prevented the global financial crisis? What would that have meant for Barack Obama and Donald Trump?The Broward and Palm Beach county election supervisors, Brenda Snipes and Susan Bucher, have attracted widespread opprobrium for their handling of the midterms. Snipes completed a recount on Thursday but submitted it to the state two minutes late, meaning that several days of painstaking work went up in smoke. Bucher admitted she was in “prayer mode” during the recount and blamed overheating machines for missing the deadline.Florida has 67 counties with 67 election supervisors, each using his or her own methods. Wilson said: “There’s not a unified system of tabulation. It’s all a crap shoot. There are 67 counties, with probably two-thirds of them not running the same equipment. They all have different standards for their ballots. It’s all unavoidable.”He added with frustration: “I would love for us since 2000 to have got our shit together. One of the reasons it bothers me is we are a state with enormous resources and our elections are always close.”But Florida is always under special scrutiny, its problems magnified. One reason is that it is the third most populous state in the nation and far more electorally competitive than the top two, California and Texas. Troubles in overwhelmingly Democratic or Republican states do not get any attention because they do not change statewide outcomes. The Associated Press observed: “Ballots got wet and couldn’t be read last week in New York City. In Utah, some counties didn’t have enough machines, causing hours-long lines. Google any state and ‘voting problem’ and chances are you will find something.”But Florida is a victim of its own importance. Save for 1992, it has voted with the winner in every presidential election since 1964. It is therefore the natural stage for nationwide battles to play out – and could be again in 2020, when Trump’s evidence-free claims of vote rigging could wreak further damage.David Becker, executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation \u0026amp Research, said: “Florida is as close to a 50-50 state as we have, or perhaps have ever had, in the United States.”Becker has been involved in Florida elections for two decades and said much has changed since 2000. “The only thing deja vu is that the state-wide margin is razor thin. We don’t have hanging chads because the technology has been improved. You can imagine how difficult it would have been if hanging chads had been thrown into this. Management and supervision has got much, much better over time. There have been significant improvements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/533645b485d7865be44e819106cfbd91e35cd46b/0_175_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fa3743fea5f652c2d7b967d3df219ca","title":"florida senate race hand recount governor","story":"Republican Ron DeSantis appears to have won governor’s race over Andrew GillumFlorida’s election torment is set to continue after officials ordered a hand recount of ballots in the knife-edge US Senate race between the Republican Rick Scott and the Democrat Bill Nelson.After a troubled machine recount finished on Thursday, Scott had a lead of 12,603 votes, or 0.15 percentage points – within the threshold of 0.25 points that by state law triggers a manual recount.But the eagerly watched and acrimonious race for governor appeared to be over, with the Republican Ron DeSantis virtually assured of victory over Democrat Andrew Gillum, according to unofficial results posted on the Florida secretary of state’s website. Gillum, bidding to become the state’s first African American governor, did not have enough votes to force a manual recount.Scott, currently the state’s governor, tweeted: “With the statewide machine recount finished, our margin of victory has increased by nearly 1000 votes. @SenBillNelson, it’s time to admit this race is over.”But there was no sign of Nelson throwing in the towel. His lead campaign lawyer, Marc Elias, announced a lawsuit against Palm Beach county, which failed to meet the recount deadline due to malfunctioning equipment.“We have sued Palm Beach County and the Florida Sec of State to require a hand count of all ballots in the county due to systematic machine failure during the machine recount,” he tweeted.Elias also noted that Hillsborough and Broward counties were reporting incomplete results. “We are monitoring the situation but we will take steps to ensure that every lawful vote is counted.”As chaos reigned, it emerged about three hours after the 3PM machine recount deadline that the heavily populated and Democratic-leaning Broward county had also missed the deadline – by two minutes - meaning the frantic process there was for naught.The county had previously claimed a successful recount, with Brenda Snipes, the county’s widely criticised elections supervisor, initially telling reporters: “We are excited to be at this point.”The Florida secretary of state will now use the first count totals from Palm Beach and Broward. Neither county’s recounts produced a substantial change from the first count. But if the final statewide result narrows down to a few thousand votes, the blunders could prove costly and prompt yet more legal challenges.In a mark of the confusion prevailing in Florida for the past eight days, Snipes also admitted that the total included 23 invalid provisional ballots that were mistakenly mixed in with valid ones and were now impossible to separate.The drawn-out recounts will drag into the weekend and have revived uncomfortable memories of the disputed 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore, which ended only after the US supreme court stopped the counting and in effect put Bush in the White House.Around eight million people voted in Florida’s midterm elections. Initial counts before the recount showed Scott with a narrow lead over incumbent senator Nelson.On Thursday, the US district judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee cleared the way to include ballots from as many as 5,000 people across the state who submitted ballots by mail that were rejected by election officials.Counties have until Sunday to inspect the ballots that did not record a vote when put through the machines. Those ballots are re-examined to see whether the voter skipped the race or marked the ballot in a way that the machines cannot read but can be deciphered. The election will be certified on Tuesday, a full week after the election.In a conference call with reporters, Elias acknowledged Nelson’s deficit is now roughly the same as it was going into the machine recount. He remains confident the gap will disappear, however, after winning a lawsuit over the inclusion of some postal and other ballots, and he believes the hand recount will also boost Nelson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5693b9429c6b7d3e18f67e3551b36c8d57886c78/1193_1275_3774_2266/master/3774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a884e02ccb853fc4d081ca8c0c132b11","title":"friday briefing brexit deal may digs in at the crease","story":"Hard Brexiters openly threaten to topple PM … fears for 600 people in California wildfires … and hear Michelle Obama read from her new memoirGood morning – Warren Murray with you at the end of a tumultuous week.Theresa May starts her Friday lacking a Brexit secretary and facing mounting threats to her leadership. Our live coverage is under way. After Dominic Raab quit the Brexit portfolio, there has been speculation in roughly equal amounts that Michael Gove might either take over from Raab, or turn down the job and resign his existing cabinet position as environment secretary in protest over the draft agreement. May’s prime ministership survived a turbulent day but the arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg is among those who have submitted letters to the Tories’ 1922 Committee seeking to depose the prime minister. Forty-eight letters are required to trigger a confidence vote. May would need the backing of 158 Tory MPs to see off any challenge.There are calls for a free vote on the draft agreement, which would allow May’s ministers to vote against it without having to resign from cabinet. The Conservative former education secretary Nicky Morgan says she is backing May’s deal, arguing that constituents “want us to just get on with it”. May gave a defiant press conference where she underscored her determination to plough on.Labour says it will call for a general election or, failing that, a second referendum should May fail to get her deal through parliament. Here is the view from Shropshire: novel among them is that of David Miller, who described himself as a welder and evangelist: “I follow the prophesies in the Bible and a split in Europe was prophesied. Europe will never unite again. God has said so.”Justice served on Khmer Rouge – Two former leaders of Pol Pot’s murderous Cambodian regime have been found guilty in what is being called the country’s “Nuremberg moment”. Nuon Chea, 92, who was second-in-command to Pol Pot, and Khieu Samphan, 87, who served as head of state, will both be sentenced for genocide carried out between 1977 and 1979. They are already doing life sentences for crimes against humanity. An estimated 1.7 million Cambodians died through a combinations of mass executions, starvation and brutal labour camps.Camp fire – The number of missing or unaccounted for people in the northern California wildfire has soared to 631 according to authorities. It is an increase of more than 500 since Wednesday. The death toll in the Camp fire increased to 63 after authorities recovered the remains of seven more people, outdoors and in the ruins of homes and cars in the towns of Paradise, Magalia and Concow. More than 9,700 homes have been destroyed, along with a total of 118 multi-family residences and 290 businesses. Police officers were involved in a shooting in an area under evacuation that left one man and two dogs dead including a police canine. The man was a 48-year-old from Berry Creek who was a suspect in a 2014 double murder. When approached by officers he allegedly reached for a gun after saying: “I’m not going back. You guys should have left me alone.”Sorry to Soros – Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, says the company has severed ties with a PR firm that stoked conspiracy theories about its critics’ links to George Soros. But in doing so, Zuckerberg repeated some of the messaging of the rightwing PR firm Definers Public Affairs. “The bottom line is the intention was not to attack an inidual but to demonstrate that a group that was presenting itself as a grassroots effort … was not in fact a spontaneous grassroots effort,” Zuckerberg said, adding: “I have tremendous respect for George Soros.” Invoking Soros as a puppetmaster funding liberal groups is well known as an antisemitic “dog whistle”. Patrick Gaspard, president of Soros’s Open Society Foundation, said Facebook’s engagement in the “concerted rightwing effort the world over to demonise Mr Soros and his foundations” was “reprehensible” and “frankly astonishing”. Gaspard noted “much of this hateful and blatantly false and antisemitic information is spread via Facebook”.‘Assange on secret charges’ – Court papers filed in the US suggest the existence of secret charges against Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks leader. The filing was made in a Virginia federal court jurisdiction that handles national security cases. It concerns an unrelated defendant but appears to include text copied and pasted from sealed documents outlining charges against Assange. The text argues the court must keep unspecified charges sealed because “no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged” and says the sealing must stay in effect “until Assange is arrested … and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition”. WikiLeaks said the filing “reveals existence of sealed charges (or a draft for them) against WikiLeaks’ publisher Julian Assange”. Assange is considered a wanted man in the US because of his publication of classified diplomatic cables and other secret US government documents, while WikiLeaks is a target of the Trump-Russia investigation.‘I was too far in’ – Mark David Chapman, who shot and killed John Lennon in 1980, has told a parole board he feels “more and more shame” about it every year. Chapman, 63, was denied parole for the 10th time at a hearing last month. A transcript has been released.Chapman said he had gone through an internal “tug of war” over whether to go ahead with the shooting after getting the former Beatle’s autograph. “I was too far in,” he said. “I do remember having the thought of, ‘Hey, you have got the album now. Look at this, he signed it, just go home.’ But there was no way I was just going to go home.” Chapman described working at Wende prison in New York state cleaning, painting and stripping wax from the floors. He said he left his quest for notoriety behind long ago and devoted himself to Jesus.Hockney under the hammer – A celebrated swimming pool painting by the British modern artist David Hockney has sold for $90.3m in New York, setting a new auction record for a living artist.Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) was snapped up after more than nine minutes of bidding, dominated by two rival telephone bidders, at Christie’s last night.

They have adapted to life in many places we have made, and they have thrived. Urban rooftop nesting gull colonies are now spread throughout the UK. The birds feed among us, on our streets, as well as on our rubbish dumps. Above all they steal our chips.“But gulls are losing out at our hands much more than the other way around. A gull moment – 30 years or so – is coming to an end. Little food waste is now going into landfill. Now most gull-edible trash is being composted or incinerated. Gulls will have to shift their behaviour once more. We’ve seen them do it before – will they manage again?”Gareth Southgate shelved plans to criticise his players for their second-half performance in victory over USA at Wembley after Wayne Rooney stole the stage by delivering a tearful post-match speech in the dressing room as he called time on his England career. In Zagreb, Tin Jedvaj scored a last-gasp winner in Croatia’s 3-2 win over Spain to set up a Nations League decider with England. Flanker Masakatsu Nishikawa has returned serve on Eddie Jones’ promise that England would “physically smash” Japan, pledging to “emotionally smash” their hosts when they meet at Twickenham on Saturday.

If England can overcome South Africa, the team they squeezed past in last year’s World Cup semi-final, they can go to sleep on Friday having eliminated their recent rivals and secured safe passage to the final four of the Women’s World T20. Meanwhile, the men’s Test team has resumed on day three of the second Test confident of victory over Sri Lanka, despite the home side’s lead.The front pages all lead with the draft Brexit deal – from the resignations of Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, to Theresa May’s leadership troubles. Some papers suggest it’s only a matter of time before May steps down. The Mail is furious with those seeking to undermine the prime minister: “Have they lost the plot?” and calling May’s critics “peacocking saboteurs” and “low-grade assassins”. The Express is also supportive of the PM, running the headline: “Defiant May: I’ll fight to the end”.The  quotes the prime minister: “Am I going to see this through? Yes I am”. But it also features front-page commentary calling on her to resign immediately. Playing things with a fairly straight bat are the  (“Resignations, a coup and a day of hostility. But May fights on”), the FT (“May defiant as draft deal threatens Tory civil war”) and the i (“Plotters move in on the PM”). While we’re on bats, the Sun continues the rather tortured cricket analogy used at May’s press conference: “She’s on a sticky wicket”, as does the Mirror, which is more critical: “Stumped”.

For indigenous Rapa Nui islanders, such statues – known as moai – carry the spirit of prominent ancestors and are considered the living incarnation of their relatives.Next week, a delegation from the island – which has been part of Chile since 1888 and is officially known as Rapa Nui – will travel to London to request the moai’s return, emboldened by the backing of the Chilean government and the museum’s willingness to engage in talks for the first time since it acquired the statue in 1869.Having spent 150 years away from its home, the statue – known as Hoa Hakananai’a –has become the focal point of a movement to return the moai which has steadily gathered momentum since August, when the island’s mayor, Pedro Edmunds, wrote to the museum requesting the statue’s return. Among the proposals the delegation will bring to the table is the idea of a replica statue being carved by artisans on the island to take the place of Hoa Hakananai’a.Chile’s indigenous development agency, Conadi – which oversees the government’s relations with the country’s nine indigenous ethnicities including the Rapa Nui – is helping to fund the delegation’s visit. The group will be led by the country’s minister for national property, Felipe Ward.“The Rapa Nui people want to explain to the museum’s administrators that the moai is the living soul of the island. Hoa Hakananai’a acts as their ambassador and we want that to remain the case – but we want to exchange him for a moai that will be sculpted by craftsmen on the island so that the representative is there voluntarily. This is very important,” said Ward.The British Museum’s press office said that they were looking forward to the delegation’s visit and “discussing any future proposals they have”.Under the command of English navigator Commodore Richard Powell, the crew of HMS Topaze removed Hoa Hakananai’a from a clifftop in 1868, along with a second, smaller statue known as Hava.Powell gave them to Queen Victoria when the ship returned to England the following year, and the monarch donated them to the British Museum.When the island became part of Chile in 1888, the state assumed sovereign rights over the territory as well as the moai that dot the island’s windswept grassland. Under Chilean law, the moai are not considered objects but an integral part of the land.According to Jo Anne Van Tilburg, an archaeologist who leads the Easter Island Statue Project and has devoted her career to the island’s renowned monoliths, the object is one of the finest examples of a moai.“Hoa Hakananai’a is a superb example of the Rapa Nui statue carver’s art. It is carved of a basaltic stone, unfinished but embellished with a suite of bas-relief petroglyphs – thus it is unique,” she said.Although the museum is governed by a strict charter that dictates the circumstances under which objects can leave its collection, Manutomatoma said the Rapa Nui are encouraged by its openness to enter into dialogue.However, she is not content with just repatriating the statues in the British Museum’s collection, given that all of the moai are of equal cultural and spiritual importance to the Rapa Nui. “To recover Hoa Hakananai’a would be great, but with time we will be asking the other countries to return our ancestors,” she said. Museums in a number of other countries, including France, New Zealand and the United States, have moai."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71d36954004cd85a674f83c3f39a90357e99c8bb/0_29_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ceaa7f0b1769660cc27fbcd4f7604b45","title":"the china show xi jinping arrives in png for start of apec summit","story":"Pomp and ceremony marks arrival of Chinese president, who is vying with Australia for influence in the PacificPapua New Guinea has literally rolled out the red carpet for Chinese president Xi Jinping who arrived in Port Moresby ahead of the Apec Leaders Forum this weekend.Xi, the first Chinese leader to take part in a state visit to the nation, touched down on Friday, days before other leaders are due to arrive for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.After leaving the airport, the Chinese president was driven along the new “Independence Boulevard” outside PNG’s parliament – a road that was funded by a Chinese loan. At the end he was met by a military band and traditional dancers dressed in parrot feathers, possum pelts and seashell necklaces. Across the capital, images of Xi beamed down from massive billboards and the streets were lined with high school students, some waving Chinese flags.Xi is in town to open the road and a school – also funded by Beijing – and meet with Pacific island leaders ahead of the Apec summit this weekend, which will be attended by other world leaders including Mike Pence, Justin Trudeau, Rodrigo Duterte, Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern.The summit is being hosted in PNG, the poorest member of the Apec bloc, with Australia and China contributing significantly toward the summit. Both countries are vying for influence in the Pacific and Apec has developed into a tug-of-war for regional influence between Australia and China, a fight some commentators think Xi has already won.PNG has already signed up to Beijing’s trillion-dollar “Belt and Road Initiative” that seeks to enhance sea and land trade routes between the Middle Kingdom and Eurasia.Prominent PNG writer and activist Martyn Namorong described the summit as “XiPEC” and Jonathan Pryke, from Sydney thinktank the Lowy Institute, said Apec was going to be “the China show”.“I’ve heard he’s the guest of government,” Pryke told the  ahead of the summit. “He’s staying in PNG and he’s hosting a meeting with the Pacific island leaders on the sideline of the leaders meeting and I imagine there will be a lot of big announcements – more investment, more aid.”In an opinion piece published ahead of the visit, Xi vowed to “lend fresh impetus to our common development” and “expand practical co-operation with Pacific Island countries in trade and investment.”Donald Trump is skipping the two-day Apec meeting, sending Pence – who is flying in from the Australian city of Cairns for one day – in his place.The lead-up to the summit has been marked by scandal. The prime minister came under attack after it was revealed that the Papua New Guinea government had bought 40 Maseratis and three luxury Bentleys to ferry leaders around, despite the country suffering from a polio outbreak and dramatic increases in tuberculosis and malaria cases, as well as funding shortages for health and education.Prime Minister Peter O’Neill bristled when asked about this ahead of the summit, snapping at journalists: “Did you ask the same question in Vietnam when they had the 400 plus Audis?”“I think it is just an overrated discussion. I’m not going to give it the credibility or credit it deserves,” he said.O’Neill also faced calls to resign this week, after the  revealed that a company he owned secured a $32.86m government contract to build bridges in the country in a process that may have violated anticorruption guidelines.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

He was a real lump.I felt discomfort as soon as he sat down because I was pinned against the side of the cabin. I asked whether they could move him or move me but it was a full flight and they decided not to move me to a crew member\u0027s seat because I\u0027d have to keep on getting up to allow them to get to the galley.Mr Prosser\u0026#39s case is set to be heard at Pontypridd County Court on FridayThey said there wasn\u0027t anything they could do so I said I wanted to make a formal complaint which I did with the on-board customer services rep.I had no choice but to go back to my seat and the discomfort at being squashed up against the cabin soon turned to agony.He is claiming between £5,000 and £10,000 as general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity.The case is set to be heard at Pontypridd County Court on Friday.Before the hearing, a spokesman for BA said: As the case is subject to ongoing proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.Brexit deal latest: Michael Gove decides not to quit in major boost to Theresa May as no confidence vote loomsHugh Grant joins Nicole Kidman in new HBO series from Big Little Lies teamWhat is the Brexit deal, and what happens next? How Michael Gove has been left with Theresa May\u0026#39s future in his handsComment: Do insects feel pain?

When asked about Japanese nuclear facilities and malicious software, Sakurada said USBs were “basically never used” in the utility systems. Mr Sakurada was brought into PM Shinzo Abe\u0026#39s cabinet as part of a reshuffle following his re-election as party leaderAides, sensing their minister was poorly briefed, could be seen rushing to give Sakurada sheets of paper with information during his exchange.Fellow MPs laughed incredulously at his replies, which were circulated widely on Japanese media and on social media.Masato Imai, an opposition MP, said “It\u0027s unbelievable that someone who has not touched computers is responsible for cyber security policies.”Mr Sakurada’s comments also prompted a backlash from voters on social media too. Doesn\u0027t he feel ashamed? wrote one Twitter user.Today any company president uses a PC. He doesn\u0027t even know what a USB is. Holy cow.Another joked that Sakurada was possibly working on his own kind of cyber security by avoiding computers.If a hacker targets this Minister Sakurada, they wouldn\u0027t be able to steal any information. Indeed it might be the strongest kind of security!Mr Sakurada was appointed cyber security minister just one month ago following a cabinet reshuffle after prime minister Shinzo Abe\u0027s reelection as head of his political party.In this short space of time he has already come fire for other embarrassing comments in parliament. These include mispronouncing an opposition lawmaker’s name and repeatedly stating I don\u0027t know the details when questioned about his new Olympic brief.Mr Sakurada complained after one of his unimpressive performances in parliament that he had not been given some questions in advance, blaming his stumbles the opposition MP Renho Murata. “Since there was no prior notice about the questions, I had no idea what would be asked at the session,” the Asahi newspaper quoted him as saying.When Renho asked him how much funding the central government would contribute to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, Sakurada claimed the amount would be 1,500 yen, equivalent to just $13. This is considerably less than the actual sum of 150 billion yen. He also suggested that he did not know that Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, had asked the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in March to allow his country’s athletes to take part in the 2020 Games.Although the minister is not expected to have much hands-on responsibility in the handling of either cyber security or the Olympics, Mr Sakurada\u0027s high-profile stumbles are seen as an embarrassment for the prime minister.Please review our commenting policyTheresa May\u0026#39s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - read in fullBrexit deal latest: Michael Gove decides not to quit in major boost to Theresa May as no confidence vote loomsLord Lester harassment accuser felt \u0026#39revictimised\u0026#39 as she watched \u0026#39wholly unfair\u0026#39 peers\u0026#39 vote to block his banHugh Grant joins Nicole Kidman in new HBO series from Big Little Lies teamWhat is the Brexit deal, and what happens next? How Michael Gove has been left with Theresa May\u0026#39s future in his handsComment: Do insects feel pain?

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties.

Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues.

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

It is completely unacceptable to turn a blind eye to children playing gaming machines that are restricted to over-18s, which risks young people becoming addicted to gambling.”On Wednesday, the government made a U-turn over the timing of a cut to maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in the face of a revolt by MPs.A reduction in the top wager from £100 to just £2 to combat problem gambling will now come into force in April, after more than 70 MPs set out to sabotage Treasury plans to push it back to October.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is completely unacceptable to turn a blind eye to children playing gaming machines that are restricted to over-18s, which risks young people becoming addicted to gambling.”On Wednesday, the government made a U-turn over the timing of a cut to maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in the face of a revolt by MPs.A reduction in the top wager from £100 to just £2 to combat problem gambling will now come into force in April, after more than 70 MPs set out to sabotage Treasury plans to push it back to October.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They have created a high-ranking committee to examine all the risks, including those raised by the IMF and the US Treasury, and those discussed during the public hearings on the legislation.The issues laid out by the IMF include reputational\u0026nbsprisks and a danger of losing its correspondent banking relationship (CBR) with the US dollar.Given these sorts of issues, the authorities expect it will take a few years to issue the cryptocurrency, the IMF report concluded.Moreover, they will only issue the SOV\u0026nbsponce its use complies with the FATF\u0026nbsp(Financial Action Task Force) standard and US regulation, and once its use in transactions in the US financial system has been approved by the US government.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Long-form streaming television, with a completely new actor.No replacement has been announced for Cruise yet, but fans have already started discussing possible options on online discussion boards.Here are nine actors who could conceivably play the former US military police major on the small screen.The 6ft 4in, 260-pound wrestling-champion-turned-actor seems like an obvious choice whenever someone is needed to play a beefy\u0026nbspcharacter (the man played Hercules, the mythological poster child of burliness,\u0026nbspin the 2014 film of the same name).With past roles in\u0026nbspGI Joe: Retaliation\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspFast \u0026amp Furious 6, the 46-year-old Johnson\u0026nbsphas the action film experience to boot, too.Kraskinski rose to fame as the personable Jim in the US version of\u0026nbspThe Office, before stunning viewers as the athletic father in his acclaimed horror film\u0026nbspA Quiet Place.The 6ft 3in actor further leaned into\u0026nbspthis pivot by starring as former Marine Jack Ryan in the TV adaptation based on Tom Clancy\u0027s novels.But while the part confirms Krasinski\u0027s ability to credibly play an action hero, it could actually play against him. The part of Ryan has strong similarities with\u0026nbspthat of Reacher and Amazon has confirmed that the TV series based on Ryan\u0027s adventures would be renewed for a second season, meaning Krasinski\u0027s dance card could be full.The 6ft\u0026nbsp5in\u0026nbspSwedish actor rose to fame in 1985 as the brawny Russian boxer Ivan drago, Rocky\u0027s antagonist in\u0026nbspRocky IV –\u0026nbspa role he\u0027s reprising in\u0026nbspCreed II, out next week in the US.Earlier this year, Lundgren\u0026nbspstarred opposite\u0026nbspJean-Claude Van Damme\u0026nbspin the action thriller\u0026nbspBlack Water.His past credits also include the three instalments of\u0026nbspThe Expendables, the action thriller\u0026nbspIcarus, and dozens of additional action flicks.Lundgren had what it takes to play Reacher back in 1985, and he still does now.Standing at six feet tall, McConaughey\u0026nbspis in the ballpark of Reacher\u0027s height.His natural frame does appear slender than that of Reacher, but McConaughey is no stranger to extreme physical transformations in the name of a part.He was muscular in Magic Mike (though his physique was more six-pack-abs stud than strong military vet), partly bald and pudgy in\u0026nbspGold, and rake-thin in\u0026nbspDallas Buyers Club.Surely, he could use his chameleon powers to step into Reacher\u0027s shoes.The 6ft 3in\u0026nbspactor is best known for his part as the godlike superhero Thor in the Marvel Universe.Stan Lee, the late co-creator of Marvel who died on Monday, once described Thor as stronger than the strongest person.While Thor comes from the fictional realm of Asgard, there\u0027s nothing barring\u0026nbspHemsworth ​from taking his superhuman strength to more earthly planes.Standing at 6ft 4in tall, Elliott is certainly fit for a character of Reacher\u0027s dimensions.He\u0027s not blond, but then again, neither was Cruise – and if authenticity must absolutely prevail, it\u0027s nothing a quick bleach job won\u0027t fix.The Canadian actor doesn\u0027t have an extensive action resume, though, having most recently starred as John Wayne in the biographical drama\u0026nbspTrumbo\u0026nbspas well as the sitcom\u0026nbspMom.He\u0027s six feet tall and a\u0026nbspFast \u0026amp Furious\u0026nbspalum who has not only acted in, but also worked as a producer for the action franchise.\u0026nbspDiesel is also famously muscular and frequently documents his weightlifting routine on social media.Sturdy? Check.\u0026nbspSkarsgård\u0026nbspfollowed a strict diet and adhered to a rigid training routine to appear as burly as possible\u0026nbspin David Yates\u0027s\u0026nbspThe Legend of Tarzan.Action credits? Not really, but from his breakout role as vampire Eric Northman in\u0026nbspTrue Blood\u0026nbspto his Emmy-Award-winning as abusive husband Perry Wright in\u0026nbspBig Little Lies,\u0026nbspSkarsgård\u0026nbsphas shown that he certainly has range.Similarly to Krasinski, the 6ft 2in Pratt rose to fame in a slightly cosier role than his current filmography suggests.While he didn\u0027t seem particularly athletic as the hilarious Andy Dwyer in\u0026nbspParks and Recreation, Pratt packed on more muscle to appear as\u0026nbspPeter Quill  Star-Lord in\u0026nbsps of the Galaxy\u0026nbspand other Marvel films.His acting credits are currently dominated by the\u0026nbspsuperhero movies and the science fiction adventure\u0026nbspJurassic World\u0026nbspfranchise, but Pratt could conceivably branch out as Reacher.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

James Moore considers whether there is any room for social responsibility in the corporate world, or if we should just ditch the spiel on valuesClick to followThe IndependentBusinesses are stakeholders in society, and vice versa“These guys are mad. Call off the invasion. Their system’s going to eat them so we won’t have to. They have these company things that they’re allowing to bust the whole place up. Let’s just sit tight and clean up once they’re done wrecking it.”That’s what an alien might very well say upon looking at the way the titans of the capitalist system have been operating.\u0026nbspYou want examples? Ten years on from the financial crisis that caused a brutal recession and a lost economic decade from which we have still to fully recover and it isn’t hard to find people who’ll tell you that the banks could easily do it again.Tech giants make money from people taking out ads that are designed to corrupt democratic elections, while other companies wreck the environment.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the carnival of corporate scandal adds a new float every few months. Yet according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, whose influence permeates through the Anglo-Saxon capitalist world, they’re all only doing what they’re supposed to do: increasing profits by whatever means necessary within the law.\u0026nbspIn his seminal work Capitalism and Freedom,\u0026nbspFriedman baldly stated that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”.\u0026nbspHe had no truck with companies having any regard for\u0026nbspthe societies in which they operate, much less furthering socially useful goals such as\u0026nbsp“providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers”.\u0026nbsp“Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades,” he opined.\u0026nbspThat view is at odds with what you’ll often hear from modern executives, who like to talk about how important the “values” of the businesses they run are\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspbig up their role as “good corporate citizens”.\u0026nbspFacebook isn’t about making money. It exists to “connect people”. “Don’t be evil”\u0026nbspfamously used to be at the centre of Google’s corporate philosophy until it was quietly removed.\u0026nbspNow it says: “The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct.”Isn’t that nice? Milton must be turning in his grave. You hear similar things on this side of the Atlantic. I once suggested to a very senior executive at a rather famous FTSE 100 company over dinner that his talk about values was basically window dressing, and that cash was king. He became visibly upset.\u0026nbspYet Friedman would have found nothing to take issue with in the investor presentations put out by the aforementioned executive’s employer.\u0026nbspHe might have found today’s fiction of corporate social responsibility frustrating, even infuriating, but he wouldn’t need to scratch too far below the surface to be reassured.The Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real\u0026nbspwages\u0026nbspin the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago. Only those at the very top have made real gainsThe majority of western companies and western executives subscribe to and live by his doctrine in nearly every respect, even if they’re sometimes reluctant to admit it.\u0026nbspThat shouldn’t surprise anyone. They are legally required to do so.\u0026nbspBritain’s Companies Act of 2006 –\u0026nbsppassed by a Labour government by the way –\u0026nbsphas the fiduciary duty of directors to shareholders at its core.It states that a director must act “in the way he (sic) considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole”.\u0026nbspIn the case of big public companies, the members are shareholders, who invest in them, as Friedman stated, for the purpose of making money.\u0026nbspCapitalism red in tooth and claw rules, say his fanboys, because it has proved far better at delivering prosperity to those living under it than any of the alternatives (Friedman was writing at a time when the main one was Soviet-style communism).\u0026nbspSo, you corporate executives, it’s time to bin all that fluff about values. Go get yourself some CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me, with apologies to the Wu-Tang Clan).\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe trouble with that view is it isn’t working so well any more, at least not for the masses, which might explain why extremists of one sort or another are finding such favour, extremists who are mostly bad for business – and yes that includes those on the right, in case you hadn’t noticed Donald Trump’s trade war.\u0026nbspThe Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real wages in the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago.\u0026nbspOnly those at the very top have made real gains. Since 2000 their real wages have risen by a cumulative 15.7 per cent, to $2,112 (£1,628) a week – nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).\u0026nbspReal wages for the average American worker actually peaked 45 years ago, a couple of years after Friedman published a piece expounding on his profits argument in The New York Times Magazine.\u0026nbspSimilar issues are at work in the UK labour market. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, a job site, recently noted that average pay is still below its 2008 pre-crisis peak.“If real wages had continued growing at their pre-crisis trend, the average person would now be earning £130 more per week than they actually do,” he said.\u0026nbspIn the boardroom it’s a different story. In a 2015 report, the High Pay Centre noted that CEOs in the UK had seen their pay increase by a factor of five since the late 1990s\u0026nbsp– despite no evidence that this resulted in better corporate performance, productivity or economic performance.\u0026nbspThe latter point was eloquently made by Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and\u0026nbspDevelopment, during a hearing of the parliamentary business committee in June.\u0026nbspYet despite the occasional shareholder rebellion, there is scant sign of any real slowdown. A more recent report by the centre found that CEO pay leapt by 11 per cent in 2017, more than four times the pace at which the average worker’s pay increased.\u0026nbspFriedman argued\u0026nbspthat a corporate executive has direct responsibility to his employers “to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Mark Zuckerberg meets world leaders – in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingPresident Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingBut, while they conform to that for the most part, when it comes to the question of their pay –\u0026nbspthey clearly break the rule. They and the non-executive directors who set it frequently act in ways that are ultimately opposed to shareholders interests.\u0026nbspThe situation reached its nadir in the UK with Persimmon Homes and its potential payment of £600m, slated to be shared among just over 130 executives. CEO Jeff Fairburn was due to receive more than £100m through it, although a public furore eventually saw him agreeing to reduce it to £75m.\u0026nbspThe company had been successful on his watch, it’s true, but that success was largely fuelled by the government-funded help to buy scheme, which underwrites mortgages for the first-time buyers Persimmon targets.\u0026nbspIt thus owed much of its success to a de facto public subsidy.\u0026nbspThe chair, and the chair of the remuneration committee who resigned in the midst of the scandal, admitted that the bonus scheme should have been capped, but this was too late to save the shareholders they were supposed to represent, who ended up handing over nearly 10 per cent of their company to its executives. No wonder one commentator referred to it as an act of “corporate looting”.\u0026nbspFiduciary duty? Forget about it!\u0026nbspPart of the reason for the repeated occurrence of this sort of thing is the way the modern company has become, in effect, ownerless – widely held by erse groups of institutional investment funds which buy and sell electronically, rarely vote on company resolutions and sometimes may only be on the shareholder register for a matter of days, even hours.\u0026nbspRemuneration committees would have you believe that they seek to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, despite their lack of oversight, by making them shareholders too. CREAM for all!Facebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to comeThe problem with that analysis is executives get their shares for free, and if something is free you don’t really value it. They rarely put their own money at risk. Perish the thought.\u0026nbspThis too often leads to them throwing caution to the wind in pursuit of potentially huge payouts. Why not?If their employer fails really badly, keels over and dies halfway down the track from an overenthusiastic application of the whip, they may lose their jobs. But corporate executives are rarely out of work for long.\u0026nbspTake a look at the career of Andy Hornby, as an example. The HBOS CEO had his hand on the tiller when the bank fell off a cliff, and the government had to step in and find a rescuer (Lloyds) which it then had to bail out.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspHornby, who was sharply criticised in a report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, ought to have been unemployable after that. But it wasn’t long before he found a new role as the chief executive of Alliance Boots, before moving on to bookmaker Coral.\u0026nbsp​RBS’s Fred Goodwin wasn’t so lucky thanks to his status as the bogeyman of British banking. But nearly all of his boardroom colleagues had secured alternative work within a couple of years of that bank’s collapse. One wonders what will now happen to those who spent time in the Carillion boardroom. Its executives also went for the bonus long shot jackpot. Expansion and profits uber alles, until the roulette wheel threw up a double zero.There was no bailout in that case, but the taxpayer was nonetheless left with a hefty bill in the wake of yet another glaring example of the capitalism Friedman advocated eating itself. But there are some companies that have eschewed Friedman’s ideas in another, more laudable respect, and with intriguing results.I’m not talking here about the corporate social responsibility\u0026nbspprogrammes most big businesses like to run. They’re often little more than extensions of the marketing budget, designed to send a message to consumers: “Hey you lot, come spend with us. You can feel good about it because even though we screw up the environment, look we’ve built a well in Senegal and we let our people go and help inner-city kids in their lunch hours.”I am instead thinking of those businesses that have actively sought to promote ersity (a favourite of the current crop of reformers) through their hiring\u0026nbsppractices.\u0026nbspFar from suffering through doing so, they have benefited, and handsomely.\u0026nbspMcKinsey, a management consultant renowned for its hard-headed intellectual rigour, sought to study the impact on the\u0026nbspcorporate profitability of hiring both more women and more staff from a minority ethnic background.\u0026nbspIts report –\u0026nbspDelivering Through Diversity –\u0026nbspshows that companies that do this make more money.\u0026nbspThe firm examined 1,000 companies from 12 countries for the 2017 study.\u0026nbspThose with workforces in the top 25 per cent for ethnic ersity were 33 per cent more likely to see higher than average profits than those in the lowest. When it came to gender ersity the figure was 21 per cent.\u0026nbspThe findings particularly stressed the importance of these groups being hired to both management roles (where they are often hardest to find) and in revenue-generating “line”\u0026nbsppositions from where executives are typically drawn.\u0026nbspCompanies that do so comply with Friedman’s demands that they maximise profits by taking his prescription and doing the opposite. \u0026nbspBut the question of whether the “profit at all costs” aim isn’t still destructive remains.\u0026nbspPutting profits first has left Britain with water companies that impose hosepipe bans while gallons upon gallons of water pours into its streets from leaking pipes.\u0026nbspIt has produced the railway debacles that have shattered the faith of the public in privatisation.\u0026nbspIt was for the purposes of bringing in a few extra dollars that Facebook allowed itself to be used by those seeking to influence the US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.All these demonstrate how self-defeating corporate behaviour that puts profits above society can be. The water industry is now dealing with tougher regulation, while the government is poised to announce a review into how rail services are delivered.\u0026nbspIf Labour comes to power both industries face nationalisation, an idea that is finding increasing favour with the public.\u0026nbspFacebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to come. There probably should be.\u0026nbspWould all this have happened were these businesses to have taken their “social responsibilities” more seriously?It\u0027s not just in the field of hiring that companies would benefit from thinking a little more carefully about what they do and how they do it.\u0026nbspEco-friendly buildings? That’s your energy bill down.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutesAct to cut emissions and curb other environmentally damaging behaviours? The costs of environmental destruction could be reduced, resulting in, for example, lower insurance premiums.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutes.\u0026nbspIt’s worth considering the experience of Nationwide and John Lewis, one a member-owned mutual, the other an employee-owned partnership, at this point.\u0026nbspThey aren’t without their failings. Nationwide, for example, is as guilty of overpaying its executives as some banks.But as a rule, they manage to balance both long-term financial success, something their owners are still interested in, with a more enlightened stance towards the society they operate within than some of their peers.John Lewis’s constitution is a particularly worthy example. It sets out employee partners’ rights and responsibilities and defines “how power is shared and our collective responsibilities to others”.Mutuals and partnerships fail just as public companies do. But as often as not it is when they follow the destructive playbook of the latter, with too little oversight brought to bear on over-powerful and overpaid executives seeking to maximise profits above all else and taking silly risks to do so. \u0026nbspPerhaps it’s time to consider a revised Companies Act to better balance shareholders’ interests with those of other stakeholders. A very senior Tory, from the party’s sane (non-Brexiteer) wing, pooh-poohed this notion in conversation with me. They argued that an employee, for example, could never be ranked alongside the shareholder owner. But why not? As I’ve tried to demonstrate, it might ultimately work in their favour.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis, where the employees are the owners, hasn’t been immune from the challenges afflicting the high street. But most of its stock market-listed department store rivals would kill to be in the position it is in.\u0026nbspWorks councils are commonplace in Europe, as is employee representation on boards, something Theresa May briefly talked about before beating a hasty retreat. \u0026nbspJohn Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield to step down in 2020Diversity makes companies richer says McKinsey. Investors take noteIt is true that they haven’t necessarily\u0026nbspserved to curtail executives’ worst instincts –\u0026nbspit isn’t hard to find examples of excessive pay at German companies for example. But look at Germany\u0026nbspand look at Britain and ask yourself which has the better way of doing things. Would anyone other than a die-hard nationalist say anything other than “Vorsprung Durch Technik”?\u0026nbspBritain, and other western nations, have also given businesses responsibility for functions they never had when Friedman was writing.\u0026nbspSo, yes, society does have a big stake in how they are run, and governed. It is high time that was recognised. Society needs seats on the board, a place in the constitution,\u0026nbspa role in corporate thinking. So do workers.\u0026nbspWhen Tony Blair coined the phrase “stakeholder” it was widely criticised as a buzzword (he was rather fond of them).\u0026nbspBut businesses are stakeholders in society, just as society is a stakeholder in businesses.\u0026nbspThe betterment of one\u0026nbspfavours the other, not least because, as that McKinsey study shows, more society can ultimately lead to more money. More CREAM for everyone.It’s time for us to recognise that and to start looking at ways of reforming the system. It really isn’t serving us very well.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It failed to see it – but that failure puts a limit on how big the rock can be, since if it was large enough it would have been spotted, according to a new paper published in\u0026nbspthe Astronomical Journal and coauthored by scientists at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Asteroid could have been spacecraft sailing past us, say scientistsThat helps to lead credence to the theory that the relatively small object is being pushed along by gas that was being thrown out of the object. That gave the effect of adding thrust as it travelled through the solar system, speeding it up.It was that strange speeding up behaviour that led scientists to suggest that it could be an alien probe, sent past Earth by a distant civilisation. The extra propulsion could be caused by the object working as a lightsail, designed to be carried along by solar radiation, Harvard scientists recently suggested.The alternative and more accepted theory of frozen gases inside the object being expelled and pushing it along was dependent on Oumuamua\u0026nbspbeing smaller than typical comets inside of our solar system. With the determination that it probably is, the research seems to suggest theories about it being an alien spacecraft are less likely.Oumuamua has been full of surprises from day one, so we were eager to see what Spitzer might show, said David Trilling, lead author on the new study and a professor of astronomy at Northern Arizona University. The fact that Oumuamua was too small for Spitzer to detect is actually a very valuable result.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is thought to be exaggerated by disruptive things like phones and social networks that encourage people to stay up and follow the news, and\u0026nbspit is thought to affect a vast proportion of the population.Usually, people are forced to wake up much earlier than their biological clock would suggest, as they get up for work. At the weekends, people will often move back again, going to sleep later and making up for it with lie-ins in the morning.This is the reason you\u0027re not sleeping wellNow a new study has found that appears to be causing social jet lag, where people are disrupting their sleep pattern between the week and the weekend.The new research came from a study that looked at\u0026nbspthe Twitter activity of more than 246,000 users from 2012 to 2013. Those tweets were tagged with geographical location, allowing researchers to use them to understand when people were going to sleep and waking up.It found that people across the US seemed to sleep in and tweet later during times that saw large amounts of holidays. Previously, scientists had suspected that social jet lag might change with the seasons and the amount of daylight – and while it does differ through the year, that appears to be more a consequence of the way people\u0027s social schedules change, rather than anything seasonal in itself.We started the study expecting it to be a solar or seasonal effect – that your internal clock will shift in the summer and that will lead to decreases in social jet lag, said Aaron Dinner, professor of chemistry and one of the study\u0027s senior authors. But in fact, that\u0027s not what we found at all. People get up later on weekdays in the summer because their social constraints are relaxed. Weekend behaviour – and presumably a person\u0027s biological clock – does not change much over the year in most counties.The researchers also found that the data about sleep correlated with obesity rates: places that tweeted until later also saw higher rates of obesity. They also correlated with sleep data taken from more traditional studies.I was impressed that so much could be learned from this purely public data set that was not at all intended to tell you about sleep, said Michael Rust, associate professor of molecular genetics, cell biology and physics and the study\u0027s other senior author. In fact, we could rediscover things like the correlation with obesity or levels of social jet lag based on time zone that were found in other studies where people designed surveys to ask about sleep directly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The majority said they had seen vermin in the house including rats, mice and bedbugsWomen and children seeking sanctuary in Britain are living in overcrowded houses ridden with vermin, a report has shown, almost two years after the Home Office was ordered to take urgent action over poor conditions in asylum housing.The report, seen exclusively by\u0026nbspThe Independent, reveals that asylum seeking families are being placed in accommodation so dirty it has made children ill and driven some women to self-harm.Politicians and charities said the “appalling” conditions were the result of both long delays in asylum decisions and mismanagement in the outsourcing of contracts by the Home Office allowing private firms to “cut corners”.Asylum seekers forced to make 40-mile journeys to Home Office meetingsAsylum seekers ‘could contribute £42m to UK if allowed to work’The research, by\u0026nbspthe charity Refugee Rights Europe,\u0026nbspcomes almost\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbspyears after a report by the Home Affairs Select Committee described asylum\u0026nbspaccommodation\u0026nbspas a “disgrace” and called for “urgent action” to\u0026nbspbe taken by the Home Office and providers to deal with the\u0026nbspissue.Since 2012, the Home Office has outsourced the provision of asylum accommodation to private providers Serco, Clearsprings and G4S, and despite widespread criticism of the conditions in the housing, the original five-year contracts were extended in 2017 for another two years.The research was carried out in collaboration with the\u0026nbspMEENA\u0026nbspCentre and the Baobab Women’s Project, which both support women and children asylum seekers. The report focused on the state of asylum housing in\u0026nbspBirmingham, which is run by\u0026nbspG4S. The research included a survey of 34 women, most of whom are single, orced or widowed, and many of whom have young children.Half of respondents said they found their accommodation either “dirty” or “very dirty” when\u0026nbspthey moved in. The majority said they had seen vermin in the house including rats, mice and bedbugs.Support workers told researchers that in some cases, children had developed chest infections and other illnesses as a result of the unsanitary accommodation.One Eritrean asylum seeking mother who moved into the housing when she was pregnant said: “The sofa smells. It’s very dirty and with the baby it’s not good. He has a throat problem, and the floor is so dirty. Everything is dirty.”The housing was often found to be overcrowded, with a third of respondents sharing a room with another person, while some reported staying in rooms with six, seven or even eight other people.One woman from Eritrea said: “The room they give me is very very small and has no cupboard. So small that I can not keep my things in there. I have to store them in the kitchen and the communal living room.”Many respondents said they felt unsafe in their accommodation, with nearly a third (31 per cent) of reporting having witnessed violence, and one in five experiencing violence themselves.A third of respondents said they did not feel safe raising complaints about their accommodation to their landlord or housing officers. When asked why, the majority said that they were afraid of losing their accommodation, while others said they did not want to seem “rude or ungrateful”.Peeling wallpaper could be seen in one bathroomThe report also raised\u0026nbspconcerns that many asylum seeking women were being placed far from available services and support networks and GP surgeries, leading to isolation and disruption to their children’s development.One single mother of four was forced to move four times over a short period of time, and said she had been unable to find a place in a nearby school for her 11-year-old son, who then had to travel long distances to attend school.\u0026nbspA support worker reported concerns that developmental issues in children had been missed by “postcode based” health visitors when they were moved around.Alarmingly, it appeared as though dispersal policies sometimes led to the continued separation of families and spouses.

The far right figurehead whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon faces a rehearing after winning an appeal against a contempt of court finding last month.She added: “We are calling for increased transparency through the publishing of contracts, and assurance that the Home Office will hold the new contractors accountable. The Home Office must ensure that iniduals seeking sanctuary in the UK are provided with humane living conditions.”Thangam Debbonaire, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on\u0026nbspRefugees, said: “The only people benefiting from this system are the private contractors providing this shoddy accommodation. These companies are being offered contracts worth £4bn over the next 10 years, and past experience shows they are not being managed properly. This allows them to cut corners and make a fortune out of desperate people.“Staffing shortages and incompetence at the Home Office mean delays to asylum decisions, forcing people to live in squalor for years.”Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said the charity had seen similar issues, citing the example of pregnant women being forced to sleep on sofas in communal areas because they were unable to climb the stairs of their accommodation.He added: “And too often families and iniduals seeking asylum are housed in areas totally unsuited to their circumstances, far from the services they need to effectively navigate the process. Living on only £5.39 per day, they are unable to travel to see their solicitors.”A Home Office spokesperson said the department would be making a number of improvements to the design of the future services as a direct result of stakeholder feedback, which it said would address many of the concerns raised.The spokesperson added: “We demand the highest standards from our contractors and their accommodation. All properties are inspected by the providers on a monthly basis, in addition to regular inspections carried out by Home Office officials, to ensure that we maintain these standards.“If an inidual has concerns about their accommodation they should raise these either with their accommodation provider or directly with the Home Office. Where there is evidence that standards have fallen short, we work with providers to ensure issues are quickly addressed and when they do not we can and do impose sanctions.”John Whitwam, of\u0026nbspG4S, said:\u0026nbsp“We always take complaints about the accommodation we provide very seriously and with specific examples we can follow them up. Asylum seekers access our free 247 service centre by telephone in large numbers to report problems, in some months we receive in excess of over 4,500 calls per month.“This demonstrates a service which is working well and asylum seekers are comfortable and willing to engage, reporting issues. Any defects raised by service users are also subject to the same strict timeframe regulations as the inspections.”Asylum and ImmigrationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This would depart from the usual practice of voting on amendments to the motion before the main motion, amended or not.\u0026nbsp“The Procedure Committee recommends that, when considering the section 13 motion, the House should not depart from its usual practice of voting on amendments before voting on the main motion.”Under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, passed earlier this year, the Commons must vote to approve the draft Brexit deal and a statement on the future relationship between the UK and EU if the withdrawal agreement is to be formally ratified.MPs on the\u0026nbspProcedure Committee said there were three\u0026nbspoptions for\u0026nbspholding a “meaningful vote” on the deal.The first would see the Commons follow its\u0026nbspusual practice of voting on amendments\u0026nbspbefore voting on the motion itself. However, the process\u0026nbspwould be adapted to allow for a much lengthier debate than the usual 90 minutes and to ensure that more than the usual one amendment is voted on.The second option would involve voting on the substance of the motion and then deciding on possible amendments. This was rejected by the committee.A third possibility would see MPs vote on a series of non-binding motions expressing varying views, before holding the binding vote on the main motion.Charles Walker, chair of the Procedure Committee, said:\u0026nbsp“The decision that MPs will be required to make on any motion to approve a withdrawal agreement will be one of the most momentous decisions ever taken both for the House of Commons and for the country.“However it is clear that there are ergent views on how the procedure should operate. Today’s report sets out three potential models for MPs to consider, with a recommendation that the House should not depart from its usual practice of voting on amendments before voting on the main motion.”\u0026nbspUltimately the Commons itself will decide what form the votes take. The government will table its proposal in the form of a business motion and put it to a vote of MPs.Live: Theresa May vows to fight on as ministers desert herPolice left with ‘no idea’ how to protect British public after Brexit What is the Brexit deal?

Conservative remain backers - around 8 MPs - have also spoken out against the deal.\u0026nbspThe PM could be forced to find up to 100 MPs from elsewhere, though that number may be whittled down by the whips.But the SNP and the Liberal Democrats are pro-Europe, and Labour is due to vote against it, so she may struggle to make up the numbers.3 What does the Brexit deal mean for UK citizens living in Europe?Protecting citizens rights has been a key issue as more than\u0026nbsp3 million EU citizens live in the UK and 1 million UK nationals reside in European countries.The agreement safeguards the existing rights of UK citizens who were living in the EU up to the end of the transition period\u0026nbspand vice versa. Family members will be able to join them, as under current rules. Children born after Brexit will also be covered.However it does not clear up questions over\u0026nbsponward movement for Britons\u0026nbspwho might want to move to another EU country from the one they are living in after Brexit.It also doesn\u0027t cover what happens to people who want to\u0026nbspwork in different countries, which is one of the main concerns for British nationals living in the EU.\u0026nbsp4 What does the Brexit deal mean for the Irish border?The Irish border has been the most difficult issue to square for negotiators.Ms May has promised to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic amid fears it could herald a return to violence and threaten the peace process.The agreement includes a backstop, which would keep the whole of the UK within a customs union with the EU to prevent the need for a endless checks at the border.The backstop is a type of safety net. It comes into force after the end of the transition period and will stay in place until Brussels and London come up with a better plan.Northern Ireland would also stay aligned to parts of the EU\u0027s single market, so goods coming in would need to be checked to see if they meet EU rules. Goods going in the other direction would not have the same checks.None of this is popular with Brexiteers or the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), as they fear it keeps the UK too closely tied to Brussels.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So we will continue to argue as hard as we can for that sensible option.”The Scottish National Party leader spoke about her “profound concern” that making special provisions for Northern Ireland as part of the Brexit plan would give that country “unfettered access” to the European market, leaving Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.She told the audience: “I as First Minister spend a lot of time talking to companies that are considering investing in Scotland, employing people in Scotland, expanding existing operations, and we do really well at attracting companies to come and invest here, we’re the best performing part of the UK outside of London for attracting inwards investment.Created with Sketch.

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will detect whether that person is on WhatsApp as soon as you do – and, if they are, pull through their information so that it can be easily added to your address book.The features have been spotted in the beta version of WhatsApp for iOS. Such updates usually come to the main versions soon after they arrive in the beta one, if they are approved, meaning that the new contact features could arrive on both iPhones\u0026nbspand Android in the coming weeks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They become the first Khmer Rouge leaders to be held to account by an international court for a campaign of genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities in Cambodia in the 1970s.The court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for lack of evidence, though he was found guilty of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint command responsibility.From Newcastle and New Zealand to the Killing Fields of CambodiaThe\u0026nbspKhmer\u0026nbspRouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead their radical policies led to what has been termed auto-genocide through starvation, overwork and execution.The crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the\u0026nbspKhmer\u0026nbspRouge.These offences comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.The breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included wilful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.Nuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van from the nearby prison where they are held.Chea Sim: Politician who left the Khmer Rouge and became a key figureSecret Cambodia diary helped to convict two Khmer Rouge ringleadersHow the west is profiting from modern slaveryCambodian opposition leader released to near-house arrest conditionsSpoilt Cambodian ballot papers seen as protest over \u0027sham\u0027 electionLawyer for Cambodia tourists says they should be deported not jailedThe prison and the courthouse were custom built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.Both defendants were present as Judge Nil Nonn opened the proceedings, but Nuon Chea suffers heart problems, so was granted permission to later move from the hearing room to a separate holding room.Khieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.A large crowd of spectators attended Friday\u0027s session, including members of the Cham minority.Lah Sath, a 72-year-old Cham man from eastern Kampong Cham province, brought his wife and four young granddaughters to Friday\u0027s session.He said he often heard people talking about the trial and sometimes watched it on TV, but decided it was time to see it with his own eyes.Just talking about the Khmer Rouge brought back horrible memories of life in those years, he said.The Cham were treated as enemies and exploited without mercy as they were forced to do intensive farm labour, he recalled.Lah Sath said his younger brother was killed by Khmer Rouge for failing to take good care of a cow.In addition to Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, the tribunal has carried out one other prosecution, resulting in the 2010 conviction of Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre in Phnom Penh.Additional reporting by APShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But, like Queen Elizabeth, Theresa May does not abdicate.”Italian newspaper Repubblica, perhaps forgetting to check its calendar, brands Brexit “a midsummer night\u0027s nightmare” in a comment piece. The outlet says the tale of Britain’s latest problem is an “extraordinarily complicated story”.Rai, the Italian public broadcaster, says Theresa May suffered “the longest and most difficult day” of her premiership, partly at the hands of Jacob Rees-Mogg – “one of the most inflexible advocates of Brexit”.\u0026nbspBut it says the PM’s “passionate intervention” at a press conference was “worth noting”.Brexit trade deal \u0027not finished\u0027 and could still change, Barnier warnsMichel Barnier urges MPs to take ‘responsibility’ and back Brexit dealThere is now ‘a Nigel Farage’ in every EU country, Michel Barnier saysMichel Barnier told to make contingency plans for second referendumGerman newspaper Die Welt says Britain has been plunged into a “deep political crisis” and says that “Theresa May\u0027s fate and that of Brexit itself are hanging by a thread”.Meanwhile Die Zeit wearily notes that “the chaos that has been battling the British government since the Brexit treaty was published came as no surprise” on account of the fact that “was in outline exactly what the hard Brexit supporters had rejected months ago”.The piece continues: “Can Mr Raab be asked whether he was present not only physically but also mentally in these negotiations with the representatives of the Union?

A senior Downing Street aide overseeing Brexit legislation also quit. Mrs May was braced for a battle to hold onto her leadership after Jacob Rees-Mogg led backbench Eurosceptics in demanding an immediate no-confidence vote among Tory MPs.

It is a failure of Government policy. It needs to be rejected, Mr Rees-Mogg said.He goaded the Prime Minister by naming leading Tory Brexit supporters including Boris Johnson, David Davis, Mr Raab, Ms McVey and Penny Mordaunt as potential successors in Downing Street to deliver a clear break with the EU.Mr Rees-Mogg predicted the 48-plus letters from Tory backbenchers needed to trigger a confidence vote would be delivered after a string of members of his European Research Group pledged to follow his lead.Backing the move, former Brexit minister Steve Baker said: We\u0027ve tried everythng to change policy but not the Prime Minister but it has not worked. We need a new leader.Andrea Jenkyns, another former frontbencher, said: From what MPs are telling me, more letters have gone in.

The instruction I take is the instruction that was given to every Member of this House by the British people in the referendum in 2016.Mrs May also rebuffed an invitation from Labour to confirm whether she thought the UK will be better off under her Brexit deal compared with being a member of the EU.Labour MP asked her to say hand on heart, whether she believes that what she has negotiated is better than the deal we have now.The Prime Minister replied: I firmly believe that this country\u0026rsquos best days are ahead of us.We will get a good deal with the European Union and take advantage of our independence outside the EU with our trade deals around the rest of the world.In a hushed chamber, Mr Rees-Mogg told MPs that while the Prime Minister was unquestionably honourable her deeds had failed to match her words.He said the deal failed to deliver her promises of pulling the country out of the EU\u0027s customs union, protecting the integrity of the UK and ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.In a reference to Sir Graham Brady, he added: As what my right honourable friend says, and what my right honourable friend does, no longer match, should I not write to my honourable friend the member for Altrincham and Sale West?In an intervention that made Mrs May wince, former minister Mark Francois told her that she had done her best but more than 80 Tories were ready to line up with opposition parties to vote down her deal.It is therefore mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons, he warned.The stark reality, Prime Minister, is that it was dead on arrival at St Tommy\u0026rsquos before you stood up, so I plead with you to accept the political reality of the situation you now face, he added.Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader Nigel Dodds signalled that the 10 MPs from his Northern Ireland party could end their parliamentary alliance that props up Mrs May\u0027s minority Tory government.I could stand here today and take the Prime Minister through the list of promises and pledges that she made to this House, and to us privately, about the future of Northern Ireland in the future relationship with the EU, but I fear it would be a waste of time, since she clearly does not listen, he told her.He accused her of pledging to pay a \u0026pound39billion orce bill to Brussels for nothing and praised resigning Tory ministers for their strong actions.Mr Dodds added: The choice is now clear: we stand up for the United Kingdom\u0026mdashthe whole United Kingdom and the integrity of the United Kingdom\u0026mdashor we vote for a vassal state, with the break-up of the United Kingdom. That is the choice.Andrew Bridgen, one of Mrs May\u0027s most outspoken Tory critics, told her: The Prime Minister is well known for her dancing - sadly having seen the withdrawal agreement it\u0027s now clear whose tune she\u0027s been dancing to.He pointed out she had campaigned for Remain, she voted Remain, now surely it\u0027s in the national interest for her to leave - perhaps following a short transition period.It took 57 minutes of the Commons session for any MP to voice support for the Prime Minister and her draft deal.Sir Peter Bottomley told her he backed her in trying to get the sovereignty she has argued for, and the prospects of prosperity, security and a fruitful partnership across the channel, the North sea and across the world.He added: The alternatives, if we do not go through with this, are the probability of crashing out and the possibility of a Government led by the Leader of the Opposition, neither of which is a desirable alternative.Speculation that International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, another Eurosceptic minister, could follow Mr Raab and Ms McVey out of the Cabinet subsided last night after she held met Mrs May in Downing Street and was seen leaving by ministerial car.

including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.The Environment Secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The popular and savvy leader of the Scottish Conservatives has been touted as the potential saviour of the Tories in Westminster.But Ruth has said repeatedly she wants to focus on Scotland and as she is not an MP she currently is not eligible to stand as leader of the UK party.In September  she declared she never wants to be Prime Minister.She will also be putting politics on the back burner for a while as she has just had a baby. Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired in , costing the party its Commons majority.Critics in her own party are circling over her handling of Brexit while a number of cabinet ministers resigned on November , , over her soft orce deal with the EU.She could be forced out MPs demand her exit and she loses a subsequent vote.There would then be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence in the Commons, leading to her government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.There could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330919181.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"1922 committee members conservatives theresa may","story":"Made up of backbench Tory MPs, the group is critical for any aspiring leader of the Conservatives.

Then, on August  his Somerset home was vandalised. Heres his story.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered parliament during the  General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the  General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He has batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Rees-Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.On October  he also said changing Conservative leader could cause more problems than it solves and the party should back May.He said the Torys lack of a parliamentary majority meant it would be dficult for an alternative leader to push through an ambitious Brexit deal.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram in September .He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May  it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £million house just around the corner from No  Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.Rees-Mogg named his sixth child Sixtus, which is a Roman name meaning polished.It is also the name of a Pope and Saint.His full name is Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher .Sixtus eldest sibling is Peter Theodore Alphege, who was born in .Jacobs only daughter Mary Anne Charlotte Emma came along a year later followed by Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan in  and Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam in .His fth child, Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, was featured in a video as his father tried to teach him how to say Brexit.Alfred was born in February .In September , a thug shouted at the children your daddys a horrible person outside their London home.It happened on August , , when the Rees-Mogg family were on holiday in the US.According to the police, graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £.m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted thathe ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees-Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.He added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Cha star and  Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the -year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea. Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0003730276661-e1541888658682.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour mp lives in social housing","story":"Shadow development secretary Kate Osamor has faced intense criticism after it emerged that she promoted her son in his House of Commons job, regardless of his conviction for having £, of Class A drugs with intent to supply at Bestival in Dorset last year.Now the Sun on Sunday can reveal that Ms Osamor and her son Ishmael, , are living in social housing in Tottenham, north London -

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them. But, given that Kirk Douglas is , maybe it’s just a reminder that things come full circle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too. This has been the real problem with our economy.But it looks like we’re on the right track.UH-OH – the Beast from the East is said to be on its way back.You remember late last winter. We were snowed in for a week. Nobody could come to visit.The missus couldn’t get to the shops to buy anything.It was just about perfect. All you need is a few bottles of Jack Daniel’s and some soup.

She makes £k a year by whispering to people over the internet.Usually stuff like: “Hello sweetheart.”She says it stimulates the listener’s “autonomous sensory meridian response”.Which is perhaps the longest phrase for “penis” I have ever heard.MONICA LEWIN­SKY was the young intern who had an affair with President Clinton, back in the s.Come on – you remember. According to reports a cigar was involved.And Monica had a revealing stain on the front of her dress.She’s been talking about the whole episode again.And she says she thought the stuff on her dress was “spinach dip”.Really  If it looked like spinach dip I think Bill should have got himself off to a doctor, pronto.Are you sure it wasn’t cock-a-leekie ASIA BIBI is the Pakistani Christian woman who was sentenced to death for alleged “blasphemy” against the Prophet Muhammad.She then had her sentence commuted and some Pakistani Muslims are going bonkers, as usual.Demanding she have her head cut off.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the s, Ted Heath and Harold Wilson both knew we would baulk at belonging to a Common Market that robbed us of our national independence.So they hid its true purpose — “ever closer union”, leading to a superstate with one currency. The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity. It looks crucial, too, to whether the deal lives or dies. Yet, knowing exactly what the EU intends for us, the PM still brazenly insisted yesterday that we WILL make our own trade deals.How, Mrs May  We cannot.

We weren’t egoists.“Our idea was to let others take the credit and keep our heads down. The DEA were looking for glory. This is the first time the British story has been told.”Chandler, who grew up in Seaham, Co Durham, was sent on a perilous assignment.According to publicity on his book: “The cartel bosses operated like a lethal multi-national organisation, with armies of hitmen and myriad spies in ports, airports, police stations and government offices.“Their intelligence systems flushed out turncoats and traitors, and they ruthlessly exterminated their enemies.“Yet Chandler, an HM Customs investigator fluent in Spanish, knew he could only succeed by recruiting local informants, and went out into the field to find them.”Among those informants was a prostitute who provided details to Chandler while they were together.Within four years he had a network of  agents buried deep inside the trafficking organisations.And the result was “unprecedented”, says the publicity.“Their intel led to the arrest of hundreds of narcos and to the seizure of  tonnes of drugs worth a staggering billion .“Chandlers web disrupted the Bogotá mafia who controlled the main airport and boasted they could put anything on a plane, from drugs to bombs.”The team also penetrated the drug crews who raced coke-laden speedboats to the transit station of Jamaica.And, they dismantled teams who smuggled narcotics through coastal ports and identied the so-called motherships, the largest method of bulk transit ever discovered.But, Chandler and his team “faced appalling risks”.There were “treacherous stool pigeons” working for both sides.Some of his Colombian law-enforcement colleagues were abducted, tortured and killed.Chandler, too, faced a grave threat when the crime lords learned he was responsible for a string of interdictions.He admitted to The Mirror that he felt guilty when a key informant – who was married with kids – was fatally shot by hitmen after a mate betrayed him, saying, “he didn’t deserve to die. To some extent I was to blame.”But Chandler continued securing drug seizures, until he finally burned out and his tour of duty came to an end.Two of his best sources were subsequently murdered, and his bosses dropped the entire overseas informant programme.The National Crime Agency is now responsible for stemming the tide of drugs into the UK.Chandler told The Mirror that although alleged Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is on trial in America, he believes the war on drugs has failed.In hindsight, he said, the team’s efforts weren’t worth “a lot of friends” dying as “we are no better off”.Narcos season four, titled Mexico, premieres on Netflix today, with all  episodes available immediately. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

communicate with intelligent le on another planet.The message, consisting of , binary digits, was aimed at the M- cluster of stars using Arecibos powerful megawatt transmitter which has a  metre antenna.Professor Donald Campbell, who was a research associate at the Arecibo Observatory at the time, said: “It was strictly a symbolic event, to show that we could do it.”The message was developed by academics from Cornell University led by Dr Frank Drake – the legendary astronomer known for devising the Drake Equation which estimates the number of planets which could host alien le in our galaxy.Speaking about the Arecibo message Dr Drake said: “What could we do that would be spectacular  We could send a message.”The M- star system is , light years away from our planet meaning the message will arrive at its destination in roughly , years.Google said: In the  years since it was first transmitted, the message has travelled only  trillion miles, only a tiny fraction of the ,,,,, or so miles to its final destination.In , the search engine founders Larry and Sergey drew a stick figure behind the second o of Google as a message to show that they were out of office at the Burning Man festival and with that, Google Doodles were born.The company decided that they should decorate the logo to mark cultural moments and it soon became clear that users really enjoyed the change to the Google homepage.In that same year, a turkey was added to Thanksgiving and two pumpkins appeared as the os for Halloween the following year.Now, there is a full team of doodlers, illustrators, graphic designers, animators and classically trained artists who help create what you see on those days.Among the Doodles published in  were ones commemorating cartographer Abraham Ortelius, Egyptian

project started by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.In , the then PhD students at Stanford University were interested in the mathematical properties of the world wide web and made it the focus of their major academic paper.The following year they built an early internet search engine at google.stanford.edu and on September , , they launched the service we now take for granted almost every

One attendee said: “I’m really shocked, something changed very late. Dom genuinely appeared to believe people would be relieved when they saw the detail. Then bam, two days later he’s gone.”Later on Tuesday Mr Raab was sent a draft of the Withdrawal Agreement and was left stunned that things he had warned must be included to get the deal through Parliament had been haggled away.Mr Raab had pushed hard for a “unilateral” way of Britain walking away from controversial Irish “backstop”, but instead he found the insurance option that would keep Britain tied to Brussels customs rules for years to come as the basis of a future trade deal, rather than a last resort.And he had seen key parts of the draft future trade deal plan that left the door open to a looser Canada-style deal stripped out in behind closed doors talks with Brussels that he was cut out from.In the final version of the text, all of the things he warned were needed to sell the deal to Brexiteers were gone.When Mrs May’s  strong top team finally got around the table at pm on Wednesday, Mr Raab surprised colleagues – by hardly saying a word.The Prime Minister went around the table, with Mr Raab speaking first, to gauge opinion of dferent Ministers - with  speaking criticising the exit terms.Some thought he was being “weasley” but secretly he had already made his mind up.He was not the only one around the table seething in anger - and his silence was in stark contrast to the anger of Esther McVey.The Work and Pensions Secretary stunned Cabinet colleagues by ripping into the Prime Minister over the “sell-out” and demanded everyone have a vote to register the scale of the rebellion in official minutes. It was swtly denied by the PM’s Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill.Pals said Ms McVey had realised she had probably gone too far and decided straight after the showdown that she’d have to go – given relations with No. were already at an all-time low over Universal Credit before the Budget.One ally told The Sun: “She wrote the letter after Cabinet and then fired it off this morning.” They added it was “rubbish” that she was reduced to tears.“Anyone who knows Esther knows that’s cobblers,” the source said. Another cabinet source added: “In a way Esther spoke for us all. We all felt appalling treated and she did not pull her punches.”The first signs of trouble emerged publicly on Wednesday evening after the PM admitted her five hour Cabinet session had been “impassioned”.But behind the black door Mr Raab had taken the Chief Whip aside to tell him he could not tolerate what he was being asked to sign up for.In a bid to calm tensions No had “kettled” Ministers inside No with a glass of “cheap red wine” while the PM addressed the nation - but their bid to sooth tempers failed.By dawn on Thursday it was clear he would not be the only going - his walk out sparking a wave of junior Ministerial departures and finally tipping the Tory right to declare it was time for a new PM.All the resignations followed the same structure, a tweet with a photograph of their letter explaining their reasons. With rolling exits every  minutes throughout the morning, Downing Street insiders began to fear an orchestrated plot.Tory whips were despatched around the sprawling parliamentary estate to sound out whether wavering MPs would back the PM in a looming confidence vote.As the flurry of resignations began to ease, Theresa May’s next headache began.Jacob Rees Mogg gathered  members of the hardline European Research Group bloc of Brexiteers to the grand wood led Committee Room of the House of Commons.After keeping their powder dry for months, the ERG were finally ready to push the button.Ever since the Tories election disaster last June, the group led by Mr Rees Mogg had urged hotheads to bide their time - but now he ruled Mrs May’s time was up.At one point the growing throng of reporters gathered outside was so large the House of Commons doorkeepers had to get police officers to marshal the crowd.Emerging from the room to declare it he was calling for a No Confidence vote, Mr Rees Mogg quipped. were getting into a bit of a bottleneck, like the negotiations.Marching through parliament, with two dozen reporters and TV cameras mobbing him, he insisted he had not launched “a coup” but insisted I am not offering my name as leader.” And the media circus continued outside the grand St Stephens entrance to the House of Commons - the very spot that Theresa May launched her bid to be PM in July .Mr Rees Mogg told the crowd: This is nothing to do with the ambition of Brexiteers. It is everything to do with the ambition of Brexit for this country. But it was clear the hardliners have decided time was up for the PM andthey cannot defeat her, at least they can show Downing Street the have the numbers to defeat her hated Brussels deal.The ERG know that they would only have one shot at taking out the PM and today the name on their lips as a replacement was Dominic Raab.One Brexiteer said: “He’s standing has risen dramatically,these letters go in I wouldn’t put it past us to pick him unanimously as our would-be leader.” And his predecessor in the Brexit Secretary role David Davis told The Sun: “He’s done the right thing.“This deal does not meet either the expectations of the referendum or the promises of the manesto.“No Brexit secretary can stay in place in the face of that.

Britain should be able to make its own FTA with America, opening that largest of all national markets to free access for British companies.And a free trade agreement with the US would also allow the UK to import American goods at the best available prices.The same applies to China. If Australia can negotiate a free trade agreement with China which gives  per cent of Australian exports to China tarf and quota-free access, then Britain can do the same.Countries such as Japan and Australia are also keen to make free trade agreements with the UK.More than that, both those countries have said they would be delighted to have the UK in the great Asia-Pacic trade arrangement, known as the Trans-Pacic Partnership.That includes  countries from Canada to Australia to Mexico to Singapore.So when you stop to think about it, there is a wealth of opportunities Britain could seize outside the EU, whereasthe UK were to stay in the EU, the EU would negotiate trade agreements on Britain’s behalf.Those agreements,they could be concluded at all, wouldn’t be designed just for the UK they would have to suit all the other  countries of the EU, and we know their interests are often very dferent from Britain’s.The EU sees Brexit as a threat.It fears a liberated Britain would steal a competitive advantage over the EU and that investment, as well as trade, would flow more to Britain’s shores than the EU’s.That, ultimately, is why the EU wants to keep Britain in the customs union.If it does, then Brexit will be no threat the EU will make trade policy for the UK and it will also write Britain’s regulatory requirements.The danger of Theresa May’s agreement with the EU is that it runs the risk of locking Britain into the EU regulatory arrangements and denying Britain the opportunity to negotiate trade agreements.In other words, the UK would gain almost nothing from leaving the EU.On the contrary, it would lose one important thing — the right to have a say over regulations and trade policy.So that’s what all the fuss is about.It would be better to crash out of the EU than be locked indefinitely in the single market and the customs union.Indeed, it would be better to stay in the EU and participate in decision-making than leave but let the EU decide the destiny of British regulations and trade policy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Britain must retain the power to leave the Customs Union when WE say. Not when Brussels grants us permission — which it has no intention ever of doing.This is fundamental to Brexit, to reclaiming our sovereignty, including the crucial right to make our own trade deals and open up our markets to the wider world. That has always been central to The Sun’s outward-looking vision of Brexit.Yes, this paper wants our Government to control immigration, just like all non-EU nations, but we DO want skilled migrants coming here to boost our economy and better their lives. And, unlike some, we are entirely relaxed about new blue British passports being printed in France.Our Brexit priority is to trade independently beyond the Brussels club. Locked inside its customs union we cannot. And the PM’s “backstop” agreement would give us LESS power to leave this central institution of the EU than ever before. No one can call that taking back control.This is too valuable a prize to barter away. It is vital for our future prosperity and the EU knows it — which is why it was so desperate to prevent it.Michel Barnier now knows this agreement he has extracted from No and wants the EU to sign off faces a heavy defeat here. Mrs May should go back to him, as her ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab suggests, and try again.Fix that sticking point and her deal might just have a prayer.THE Government’s super-soft deal, as it stands, is not a viable or stable future for Britain. Nor is a second referendum that hands Remainers victory.Britain was already staunchly eurosceptic two years ago when we voted Leave despite the onslaught of state-funded pro-Brussels propaganda. The animosity towards Brussels is tenfold now. Even many Remainers are disgusted at the EU’s behaviour — and the capitulation inherent in our deal.How would the nation respondit went ahead  With rage, at the Tories and the EU whose arrogance enforced it.  The beneficiaries would be Ukip, or a party even more extreme, committed to Brexit in full. The deal would not last.Nor would Remain winning a second vote solely through fear of a no-deal.  It would solve nothing and heal nothing.

After a few rounds of voting, the numbers will be whittled down to two.Those two will go to the Tory members to fight for their votes, in a campaign that can last several weeks.Whoever wins that vote will become the next Tory leader and Prime Minister.She added: From the EUs point of view, they want to see the ECJ still having jurisdiction over us - we are very clear that cannot be the case.Weve held out, weve held our ground and theyve given in.But its a negotiation and any negotiation, complex as it is, is actually a negotiation which leads to compromises.And she hinted the current version of the deal could change ahead of an EU summit pencilled in for next weekend, saying: Weve still got some things to sort out with them.Mrs May added that the agreement would be finalised at the meeting on November  and said: I will then bring that deal back to Parliament.Backbench chief Graham Brady could announce at any moment that he has received the  letters needed to trigger a contest.The PM is clinging to No by her fingertips after two Cabinet ministers were among four to quit over her Brexit deal.Dominic Raab and Esther McVey accused Mrs May of selling out voters by signing up to an agreement which could keep Britain closely tied to the EU for good.She won some breathing space last night as Mr Gove, the Environment Secretary, and International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt stayed in their jobs for now.This morning Mr Gove repeatedly refused to tell reporters whether or not he plans to stay in the Cabinet.Asked on LBC whether hed threatened to quit last night, Mrs May said only: I had a very good conversation with Michael yesterday.She added: Michaels done a really important job at Defra [the Environment Department]. mI want all of my colleagues in the Cabinet to feel able to carry on doing the excellent job theyre doing.Mr Gove told the PM hed only take the positionhe was allowed to rip up her deal and negotiate a new arrangement with Brussels.His resignation would be the biggest blow yet to Mrs May because he has become the key Brexit figure in her Cabinet over the past year.Mr Gove has been the only Brexit-backing minister to support the PMs strategy without reservations up till now.He is seen as a possible future leader, having stood against Mrs May in the  contest.But he is also deeply attached to his current job as Environment Secretary where he is seen as the most dynamic Cabinet minister.Mr Gove has an emotional link to the portfolio - as a child he saw his fisherman father lose his business because of EU rules, motivating him to lead Britain out of the grasp of Brussels.Mrs May used a defiant press conference to face down her critics, insisting she will battle for her future with every fibre of my being.The PM said: From the very beginning I have known what I wanted to deliver for the British people to honour their vote in the referendum.The British people just want to get on with it - they are looking to the Conservative party to deliver.And asked by The Sunshe would fight against the leadership challenge launched by furious MPs, Mrs May replied: Am I going to see this through  Yes.And she compared herself to England cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott, adding: What do we know about Geoffrey Boycott  He stuck at it and got the runs in the end."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004371736252.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"how old theresa may prime minister salary brexit","story":"Here is all you need to know about the Conservative leader.May, , was born in Eastbourne, Sussex on October  .She graduated from Oxford University with a geography degree in .May has previously worked as a financial consultant and senior adviser in International Affairs before she turned her attention to politics.Her previous positions in Government include Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities.Theresa May has been the MP for Maidenhead since .In , then Home Secretary May, revealed to the Daily Mail that she has Type  diabetes, a disease which carries risks of heart attacks and strokes.Speaking at the time, May said she carries a needle with her at all times and must inject herself with insulin at least twice a day.She said: It was a real shock and, yes, it took me a while  to come to terms with it.The diabetes doesn’t affect how I do the job or what I do.

Watching a besieged woman Prime Minister vow to stay in the game despite having more sharp metal chucked at her than a kne-throwers’ assistant, took us back to the steps of the British Embassy in Paris in November  and Margaret Thatcher pledging to “fight on and fight to win”. Like Thatcher, May was facing a potentially fatal revolt from her own MPs due to the party’s deep split on Europe.And once again, as Oscar Wilde said about the death of Little Nell, you had to have a heart of stone not to laugh. It was pure comedy gold.  There was Raab C. Exit, the man charged with coming up with a Brexit deal, resigning over the deal he came up with, Cruella McVey doing what she has sanctioned thousands of workers for doing by walking out on her job, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, like Postman Pat in a Lord Snooty suit, delivering a no-confidence letter in his leader. We waited for Penny Mordaunt to reprise her exit from TV’s Splash! by belly-flopping out of the Cabinet, and played Where’s Govey as the absent Environment Secretary was being touted as the gallant knight to rescue Downing Street’s damsel in distress. Some felt pity for May, on the grounds she has tried to make the best of the impossible hand she’s been served. But not me. She’d called an opportunistic general election nobody had wanted, convinced it would win her overwhelming backing for whatever Brexit she chose.  But she failed abysmally and instead of resigning honourably she crawled to the DUP, writing them a blank cheque which they were always going to cash but honour only on their terms. She promised us strong and stable leadership in the toughest of times, then ruled with less backbone than a tapeworm, her every move governed by fear of upsetting the Jurassic element of her party who, to borrow David Cameron’s description of their soul-mates in UKIP, are “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”. The only pity any of us should be feeling, as we survey the wreckage of this drawn-out Tory civil war, is for the country’s youth. They’ve been let down by an older generation whose obsession with the past and fears about the wider world, have saddled them with a poorer future than they deserve. I don’t even blame the majority of Leave voters who were duped into believing this Utopian fantasy called Brexit.I blame the devious liars, dressed up as heavyweight politicians, who conned them.  Never forget that David Davis promised a “no-downside” Brexit with “the exact same benefits” of EU membership, Michael Gove assured us that when it came to deal-making “the UK holds most of the cards” and Liam Fox boasted that getting a free trade agreement with Brussels would be “one of the easiest in history”. How’s that going  In the midst of yesterday’s shambles, Tory Alan Duncan accused “absurd” Brexiteers of helping make Britain “ungovernable”. He’s right. They won’t be happy until they’re doing Vera Lynn impressions in their baths singing “there’ll be huge queues over the side roads of Dover”. But a better description of May’s rabble came last month from Army officer-turned-Tory MP Johnny Mercer, who described his party as a “sh*t-show”. Looking at them sacricing the future of a country they claim a superior love for,I’d say that never in the field of political conflict has such a sh*t-show been so deserved by such a shower of treacherous sh*ts.Enjoy their well-deserved disintegration.

By lunchtime, there’s already a buzz around the tiny Essex village. Unlike generations of politicians, a United Nations investigator, Philip Alston, is making time to visit during a tour of the UK to shyinvestigate the emergence of ‘extreme poverty’. Today, he will report to a disintegrating UK government what he’s made of the harrowing stories he has been hearing across the country. I hope Alston will tell ministers about Rob, a nurse, who developed a serious health condition and found himself assessed by “people who barely have a health qualication” and was found ‘fit for work’.  “In January I applied for ESA,” Rob told the UN man. “It took them seven weeks to tell me they had never received the form.I had to live on handouts. Going to a foodbank, it really does make you feel worthless.” And I hope Alston will tell them about a young disabled woman called Mollie who described “watching poverty crippling my mother”.And Rebecca who spoke about the “hostile environment” of zero-hours work.  And a young woman called Raven who spoke up about “girls with toilet paper Sellotaped into their underwear” during their period. Jaywick, which regularly tops the list of ‘most deprived’ parts of the UK, is well used to being the poster child for poverty. A few days ago, a picture of one of its streets – Austin Avenue – was used on an attack advert by the Republican party in the United States. “They’ve no right,” Doris Telford, , a retired advocate for elderly people says. “They’ve never even been here.” Scott Michael, , nods. “We’re fed up of people saying we’re a shanty town,” he says. “We’re a community.”  A tenant of one of the houses in the picture asks not to be identied. “I didn’t have a choice about moving here,” she says.“The council moved me out of London because of the benefit cap. It’s a good enough place but the houses are falling down.” Built when motoring was in its infancy, Jaywick’s streets are named after cars, and the street plan was designed to look like a car grille. In the s, newly mobile families were able to get to the seaside at weekends, and a shyproperty developer had the idea of selling them land to build chalets on.  During the postwar housing crisis people started moving to Jaywick permanently.Now, decades on, many of these originally shytemporary homes are desperately patched up, or in dereliction, but local spirit remains strong. Even the village’s one pub is called the Never Say Die.  Today, at the Community Centre, built on what was once the boating lake, most of Jaywick has squeezed in to see Mr Alston, the man from the UN, and to hear searing testimonies organised by Unite Community. One man, called Steve, tells Alston he and his we had both been made redundant by the job centre.“The debts just kept racking up,” he says. “We were relying on foodbanks. We could just about afford to feed the kids, but we were missing meals. I felt I needed to provide, as a man, and I couldn’t do it. I didn’t realise how bad it had affected me. “In January , I contemplated taking my own le. I thought no one will miss me, I’m useless. I’m just going to end it.”  When he tried to get help he was told he could only have telephone counselling. Another speaker, Trisha, tried to take her own le after getting pound, into debt. She’d worked her whole le for the NHS but left with spinal problems.Help from Christians Against Poverty made her realise “I’ve got a lot to live for and a lot to offer”.  But she adds: “Now, my area has gone to Universal Credit and I’m struggling again.All the clothes I’ve got on now are from the British Heart Foundation. I was six weeks with no money coming in, living off baked beans.” She finishes sadly: “It’s a lonely world out there.” Wheelchair-user Erin’s family went from “a comfortable middle-class two-income household” to near destitution after she had a brain haemorrhage.The family have found themselves excluded from the rental market because of insidious ‘no DSS’ rules. “So I am to be made homeless,” Erin says. “I don’t where I am going to be putting our -year-old child to bed.This is the hostility faced by disabled people under austerity. We’ve even lost the very human right of a home.” Alston is clearly moved by what he’s heard, and he reassures people their testimonies “are not going to be for nothing”. At the end of the meeting, in carefully chosen words, he echoes one of the final speakers.“Mike says that ‘Austerity is a political choice not an economic necessity’. That’s right. Poverty is a choice. You can choose not to make people poor.” Outside, night has fallen, and opposite the Community Centre the boarded-up Mermaid Inn and the derelict Dolphin Diner are a reminder of what Jaywick once was and could be again, given a fair chance. Today, the world will hear from Alston.How bitterly ironic that while he’s been here one of the politicians most responsible for these stories – Esther McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions – has resigned. Not from shame, but because she now hopes to become Prime Minister. "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa offering false choice brexit","story":"NewsopinionTheresa May is offering  choice on Brexit.

Instead, it has turned into a national humiliation. All the promises of greater sovereignty and a swashbuckling UK negotiating new trade deals have turned to dust. And one by one the advocates of those promises have resigned and walked away. With the publication of the withdrawal agreement we can now see more clearly the reality of Brexit. Instead of taking back control it turns out to be the biggest voluntary surrender of sovereignty in living memory.  The UK – the fth biggest economy in the world – is faced with signing up to the rules which govern our economy with no say over them - and paying tens of billions of pounds for the privilege. The only argument the Prime Minister can come up with for the Agreement is that it was the best we could get and the alternative of no deal is worse. The Government has tried to tell parliament and the country that this agreement must be accepted because no deal would be an economic disaster and would mean a hard border in Northern Ireland. No deal certainly would be a disaster but the idea that it has to be this agreement or no deal at all is a  choice. Parliament would have the opportunity to halt a slide into a no deal departure and, indeed, the Prime Minister herself has admitted this when she said outside Downing St that “no Brexit” is now an option too. She knows this deal satisfies neither Remainers nor Leavers. For two years this has been a theoretical argument with ious models being pitted against one another. It’s not theory anymore. Now we have an agreement which shows the reality of Brexit and exposes just how distant it is from the promises of its leading advocates. I have never believed the measure of our country’s power is just about our degree of sovereignty. Instead, I believe Britain’s power is magnied by the alliances we have with other countries. But even on its own terms this agreement fails to meet the promises of sovereignty made by those who championed Brexit. I know that many of my constituents voted for Brexit and I understand their anger at lack of opportunity and the sense that the economy was not working for them. I passionately believe that areas like the one I represent need a better deal, with more educational opportunities, better jobs, higher pay, more housing and a bigger stake in the future of the country. This agreement gives them none of that and I do not believe many of them voted for an outcome like this.

But the very first caller challenged her to step down. The man, who identied himself as Daniel from Louth, said he commended the PM for trying to strike a Brexit deal with the EU but sadly that has not worked. And he asked her: Please Prime Minister, tell me why do you think you should stay on as PM when you have failed - despite your no doubt honourable intentions - tothe referendum result  If you cannot do that, I respectfully ask you to do the right thing in the national interest and stand down to allow someone from the Brexit camp to take the lead. There is still time to sort this out.  Mrs May responded by going through details of the draft withdrawal agreement. Youre absolutely right that for a lot of people who voted Leave, what they wanted to do was make sure that decisions on things like who can come into this country would be taken by us here in the UK, and not by Brussels, and thats exactly what the deal Ive negotiated delivers, she said. Later in the programme, another caller thanked her for everything youve done for this country - before telling the Prime Minister shed let Brussels get the better end of the deal, and suggested arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Moggg should take over. Asked whether she had spoken to Environment Secretary Michael Gove about his future in the Government, Mrs May said: I had a very good conversation with Michael yesterday actually. Mrs May said she had discussed the fishing industry with Mr Gove but, asked whether she had offered him the job of Brexit Secretary, she replied: I dont talk about things to do with the Cabinet reshuffle. I havent appointed a new Brexit Secretary yet, but obviously I will be doing that over the course of the next day or so.  Askedpeople would be wise to put bets on Mr Gove getting the job, she told presenter Nick Ferrari: Ive always made it a sort of rule in my le that I dont bet on anything to do with politics. I would advise you not to either. Mrs May explained her comparison of her approach to Brexit to the cricketing style of her sporting hero Geoffrey Boycott. The thing about Geoff Boycott is he was absolutely steady, he kept there at the crease, he carried on and relentlessly went about his goal, and I think thats important, she said. Mr Ferrari said that Boycott had ended his career by being run out by one of his own team, Jim Love of Yorkshire, and asked whether Michael Gove might play the same role in her career. She replied: I think Michael Gove is Scottish.

Judi James, a leading communication ace, toldthe Prime Minister won the dance-off against Rees-Mogg despite showing several signs of tiredness at Number  Downing Street. She also compared her nemesis and influential Brexiteer Rees-Mogg to a Bond villain and Ming the Merciless, the ruthless tyrant in the Flash Gordon comic. Nevertheless, Mrs May vowed to stand and fight in a stubborn statement warning of consequencesshe is forced from power. Speaking exclusively to , Ms James said: Despite the presidential setting of her statement tonight the start of her speech was so poorly and ambiguously worded and her and her facial expression initially so drawn that it was dficult to guess whether her aim was to resign or to fight another day.  In the end she mustered her energy and gave a speech that was a reiteration of her stance in Parliament this afternoon, only with several verbal and non-verbal swerves to avoid questions about the very obvious problem of the cabinet resignations and the Ming the Merciless stance being taken by Rees-Mogg. For sheer resilience and grit it looks as though she could have won the dance-off against Rees-Mogg.  She clearly showed several signs of tiredness, with her face getting shiny and her words becoming confused at times, but she corrected herself with good humour, rolling her eyes to the ceiling when she called a reporter by the wrong name and throwing her hands to her face in a gesture of mock-shock that sadly also probably provided the papers with their shot for tomorrows front covers. May has lost some of the steel that she can show when shes battling at her best, but to fight back from a last cricketing-based press question by comparing herself to Boycott as her exit line suggested shes not going to give up easily any time now.  After three solid hours of grilling in the Commons, where her own backbenchers provided most of the open back-stabbing, and then this speech and press questions May is still clinging to her Brexit solution with no body language clues or tells suggesting she secretly knows she is trying to bluff or sell the country a load of snake oil. She arrived in the House looking puffily pink-eyed but her emotional display today ranged from a very normal-looking sparring with Corbyn where she raised a finger of power and righteousness or sat laughing and mocking his points, to a more charming and patient-looking fielding of questions from the benches on his side through to some much more testy and impatient-looking replies to questions from her own benches. Her responses to her back-benchers involved a speeding up of her verbal delivery and a staring ahead to suggest shes had more than enough of the dissenters in her own party and it was then that she looked truly rattled.  When Rees-Mogg threw his killer point and then sat back to use the unblinking stare of a Bond villain though she carried on regardless and this repeated assertion that she is doing what is the best for the country does seem to be her genuine belief that she could stick to whether anyone  believes it or not. Was it Custers last stand  She looks isolated, and clearly tiredness was understandably a problem, but her constant repetition andto her core message and her emphasis of the dangers of any alternatives suggests she could stick to her guns, genuinely believing she is right, to the bitter end.

His big moment has arrived. So lets not forget his views on gay rights, abortion, food banks and zero-hour contractsShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporterDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsJacob Rees-Mogg is a big-time Brexiteer - so what  does he believe  \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has fired the starting gun on a challenge to Theresa Mays leadership today. Its his big moment - the pinnacle of months of campaigning for a hard Brexit he knew the Prime Minister wouldnt deliver. The famously plummy-voiced Old Etonian chairs the European Research Group, a forum for the Tories extreme Eurosceptic backbenchers. Today he wrote to Graham Brady, the chair of the influential  committee of Tory MPs calling for a vote of no confidence in Mrs Mays leadership - and his group urged others to follow suit. Its likely to start an avalanche of similar letters to Brady, andhe gets  therell be a vote. If Mrs May loses the vote, shes out.  So who is Jacob Rees-Mogg - and more importantly, what are his views on issues that arent all about Brexit  Heres a quick reminder. Who is Jacob Rees-Mogg   Parliamentary history geek Mr Rees-Mogg, who even wears a double-breasted suit in family snaps, is the son of a former Times newspaper editor and amassed a vast fortune through his City firm Somerset Capital Management. He has six eccentrically-named children with his aristocrat we Helena, whose ancestors include Charles I advisor Thomas Wentworth and former Prime Minister Charles Watson-Wentworth. A painting of his horse hangs in the National Gallery. Her family inherited the sumptuous stately home Wentworth Woodhouse, which was given a pound.million repair grant by the Tory government last year despite soaring homelessness. Mr Rees-Moggs quirky mannerisms have given him a cult status among Tory activists with one, Ross Atkinson, getting a tattoo of the word Moggmentum on his chest. The Mirror later revealed Facebook rants in which Mr Atkinson complained sex assaults were a cultural norm for refugees.  He sparked fury last year by claiming the huge rise of food banks is uplting. The free marketeer insisted the state cant do everything adding: I think there is a need for some private charity on top of what the state provides. The MP told LBC radio: I dont think the state can do everything that it tries. It provides a base of welfare that should allow people to make ends meet during the course of the week but on some occasions that will not work. And to have charitable support given by people voluntarily to support their fellow citizens I think is rather uplting and shows what a good compassionate country we are. There are two Trussell Trust food banks alone in the MPs North East Somerset constituency, while he lives in a Grade II-listed manor house with Helena, the children and a nanny.  Committed Catholic Mr Rees-Mogg said last year he is opposed to abortion, even for women who have been raped. The traditionalist backbencher said he was “completely opposed” to abortion, adding: “Le begins at the point of conception.” Askedhis opposition was so absolute it included cases of rape and incest, he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I’m afraid so. Le is sacrosanct. It begins at the point of conception, and I think it is wrong.” Labours Yvette Cooper said the idea that the Conservative Party would consider someone with Mr Rees-Moggs views as a potential leader was an appalling thought. She added: Eveybody’s entitled to their own personal views and their own personal views and their own conscience views about an issue like abortion, but for somebody who the Conservative Party seem to be suggesting could be the next Prime Minister to want to control women’s bodies in this way, even in cases like rape and incest, I personally find quite shocking.  Speaking at a fringe event at Conservative Party Conference, he said: “I loathe this idea that we’ve got to give baubles to young people. I think it is so desperately condescending. Young people are not some alien species that we have to treat dferently from other voters.” Of Labour he added: “Of course they want to give everyone free tuition. because they’re socialists. They like spending other people’s money. That’s what socialists do.”  In a  article he said zero-hour contracts were an excellent way for students to find work in the university holiday. People find these contracts could be an important stepping stone from unemployment and welfare dependency to employment, he declared. They benefit business, consumers and taxpayers by keeping costs down. And he claimed Labours campaign against the exploitative measures was the standard response of the left to market forces. And he opposes gay marriage  Last year Mr Rees-Mogg said he supported the teachings of the Catholic church, which opposes same sex marriage, because marriage is a “sacrament.” He added: “The teaching of the Catholic church is completely clear. The marriage issue is the important thing. This is not how people arrange their lives. It’s that marriage is a sacrament, and a sacrament is under the authority of the church, not of the state.

A deal was agreed between the UK and the EU, but it chances of survival are fading. Theresa May faces defeat for the deal in the Commons, a Tory no confidence vote, and seven resignations - including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey. As time runs out, plans are now being put into action in case a deal doesnt happen. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and have to stockpile food and medicine at the stroke of pm. The government has issued  technical notices on the practical effects of No Deal - everything from driving licences to cats. FOLLOW IT LIVE HERE  A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But thats not what whove written this guide for. More than enough has been written about business. Instead we have looked through the facts to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader - and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen.  No Deal will happenBritain cant find a compromise between all these issues that keeps everyone happy enough before  March . It will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increase the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . . You need to renew your passport early  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, a government note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There would be a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners would have to visit a vet at least four months before visiting the EU. This means pet owners intending to travel to the EU on  March  would need to discuss requirements with their vet before the end of November , government papers warn.  The animal would have to have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days before travel, to prove the vaccination worked. Once that was completed, the pet owner would have to visit a vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. This is the worst case scenario. In another form of No Deal Brexit, the UK could be made a listed third country. This would increase red tape but not as much, with a visit to the vet only needed three weeks before travel.  Flights could be grounded in a worse case No Deal Brexit. British airlines hoping to fly planes between the EU and UK would have to win permission from each separate country, the government admits. European firms wanting to carry passengers between Britain and the continent would have to seek authority from the UK. UK airlines would also lose the automatic right to fly planes between two EU destinations, such as Milan and Paris. The government says it envisages granting permission to EU airlines and getting permission to fly in the EU. But Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said there was a risk that flights would be groundedgoodwill fails. He told MPs: “It’s not implausible, it’s not impossible. It could happen deliberately, it could happen by mistake. It depends on how friendly or unfriendly the accompanying music is while all this goes on.” . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar disruption  Eurostar services could be suspended in a no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the notice seems to be saying that the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . Youll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you may need an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents would be sold at , post offices from February. Currently theyre sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Your mobile phone roaming charges may be hiked  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked - less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June , meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreementthe UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing % of customers - Three, EE, O and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government has warned. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left stranded with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your cheap holiday bus to the continent faces being cancelled  The government warns UK coach operators may be unable to access the EU at all. Currently, the EU is part of the “Interbus Agreement”, which allows for coach operators to run occasional and regular services in other countries. The plan is for Britain to rejoin the agreement as a third country member. The new agreement will only apply to occasional services - so coach holidays and tours can continue. But regular services would not be permitted. The documents urge UK operators to rewrite their terms and conditions to allow them to subcontract some or all of their journeys to EU-based operators. The document also warns new checks at EU borders are could cause delays at ports. But the government promises “contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic.”  November : After months of stalled talks over the Northern Irish border, deal is reached at a technical level between the UK and EU.  November : Cabinet meeting reluctantly agrees the deal after  hours but  ministers speak against it.  November : Theresa May gives statement to Parliament.  November : Emergency EU summit with  other leaders to sign off the deal. - December : The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to agree a deal. Already its much later than was ideal. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day. After a deal is reached: MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will likely face a Tory leadership challengeshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But talk has been floated of extending this by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. Read the full guide to the timetable here. Tory ministers could hand corporate giants a massive tax cut in a No Deal Brexit , a top Cabinet figure revealed in October. Dominic Raab said the government will “pull every lever weve got” to ease business “disruption”the UK leaves the EU with no agreement in March . The Brexit Secretary even left open a radical idea of slashing corporation tax from % to % - which would firms a huge tax break while millions of working families struggle. He spoke on the fringes of the Tory conference hours after Chancellor Philip Hammond said he was reserving “fiscal firepower” to “support the economy” in No Deal Brexit.  A leaked warning revealed NHS chiefs fear RUNNING OUT of drugs in a chaotic No Deal Brexit . NHS Providers, the body for inidual hospital trusts, sounded the alert in a private memo to Tory ministers and the head of the NHS. The bodys chief executive Chris Hopson declared there is a lack of communication nationally about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal. Without national planning and coordination, there could be both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices, he wrote.  As a result, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed plans to fly in medicines to treat millions of patientstheres no deal. The Cabinet minister said officials are drawing up the plans to import lesaving drugsports are blocked, meaning they cant be shipped to the UK. He told MPs: Were working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry.  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. . Your local supermarket giant faces having to stockpile food  The government has all but confirmed food could be stockpiledwe crash out of the EU without a deal. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government will be ensuring Britain has an adequate food supply. Indicating private firms, or others, could be the ones to stockpile food, he told MPs: It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling. Reassuringly, Prime Minister Theresa May added: This is not just about stockpiling. Presumably it’s MS stockpiling. . You could be affected by civil unrest  A No Deal Brexit could spark civil unrest within just two weeks, the UK head of Amazon warned - and the firm is planning for such an outcome. Doug Gurr allegedly made the shock comment to Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab during a business retreat at his grace-and-favour stately home Chevening. A source revealed the comment to the Times, and it was not denied by Amazon. Instead a spokesman said: Like any business, we consider a wide range of scenarios in planning discussions so that we’re prepared to continue serving customers and small businesses who count on Amazon, eventhose scenarios are very unlikely. The government has been actively hiring experts on civil emergencies to deal with leaving the EU. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government recruited three pound,-a-year workers to do the disaster job. The job description warned any takers must ensure public authorities are ready to prepare for, respond to, and recover from civil emergencies of all types.  A major motorway is being closed overnight for more than a month in the run-up to Christmas so it can be turned into a lorry park in case of a no-deal Brexit . Highways England began preparations in October for the M in Kent to be used as a holding area for lorriesthere is gridlock at ports like Dover. But the plan was not disclosed to local councillors or MPs until just hours before work began. Tom Tugendhat, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, was furious. He said his community was kept in the dark about the M work after receiving assurances that nothing was planned. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Tugendhat said: Its come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members.  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

Kristy Watson, from Victoria in Australia, made the decision to post the photos on Facebook in the hope that no mother, no family ever has to go through the pain, heartbreak and loss she has suffered. The -year-old cafe worker said it was dficult to come to terms with being pregnant as a single mum, following three dficult miscarriages, but calls it the most beautul experience. She praised her body for being strong enough to carry a baby when she didnt believe she could, but  weeks into the pregnancy she had an inkling something was wrong. I knew something wasn’t right, she explained. From the horrible swelling in my feet hands and face, the headaches that lasted weeks on end, the blurry vision, my blood pressure going up and down I knew that this weren’tjust normal ‘pregnancy symptoms’.  But after numerous amounts of doctors visits, in and out of hospital, even trying to contact another hospital for a second opinion I was told it was just normal. Kristy claims that for the next six weeks she was repeatedly sent home after sharing her concerns with doctors. It was not until a nurse sat down on the end of her bed,  weeks and five days into the pregnancy, that she found out she had pre-eclamspia, a condition that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine. The nurse also told Kristy that her baby no longer had a heartbeat. Three days later, she was induced and endured a -hour labour before finally getting to hold her leless baby boy, who she named Kaycen. She bathed him, dressed him in his baby clothes and lay him in a cot surrounded by teddies.  She warned women to listen to their gut, fight for answers and make sure theyre listened to. I felt my sons last movements on the th of July around . to then not be able to find a heart beat the next morning at am, Kristy said. I had to go from having my whole le line, my world move around and be healthy in my belly to then be induced to deliver my sleeping baby. I had lost my gorgeous little boy due to the system letting me down and not listening to me when I knew something was wrong. I had to watch my family be so heartbroken over the loss of their nephew, grandson and cousin and myself because no one cared enough to help when I needed it. I want people to know my story so they know when their gut is telling them that something is not right to fight for answers, to travel back and forth until they know what is going on, to make sure they are listened to. Because I now have to go home to a nursery full of everything I needed to raise my little boy.  To an empty cot that my son never got to lay in, to books I never got to read him, to his favourite outfit I never got to dress him in all because I was not heard. I now go home empty handed with a heart so broken that it’s going to take a long time to heal. She ended her heartbreaking post with an appeal to other women to listen to what their bodies are trying to tell them - and insist that doctors check them over until they have an answer. Please listen to your bodies, I know some people don’t have to go through the stress I had to go through weeks leading up to my sons death. We have to look after ourselves just as much and I couldn’t imagine any other mother having to feel like they failed their child like I’ve had to. She added: Please feel free to share, I don’t want this post to be looked at as a blame on anyone. I want people to know what I went through and in any way help prevent such a thing happening to someone !

It also affects their speech, as well as their ability to move their eyes or even blink. Alex, from Coventry, says he knows when Erin is happy because she always puts her head on one side and says ooh.Erin, from North Carolina, in the US, added that its great having someone who understands her.Their condition is very rare, with only around  people with it in the UK and less than , worldwide. But Alex and Erin found love after meeting on a social media site for people with Moebius syndrome. And despite only meeting four times, they are already engaged.  Alex said: “If I meet people for the first time they might smile at me in greeting and then they are wondering why is he being rude  Why is he not smiling back  And I’m like I’m not smiling back because I actually can’t…I actually can’t do it. The main issue that I have is that I can’t show facial expression, so my speech is slightly slurred, and I can’t smile or express any emotion.As you can also see I don’t have all my fingers and I have not got all my toes either, so walking is quite dficult.  Growing up, Alex had a happy childhood until he reached his teens, when he was severely bullied. He said: I was the only disabled student and I got bullied and I hated it.It just made it really, really hard for me to cope and I was like, why have I been made like this  All my friends were getting girlfriends, I felt quite excluded from that. Dating was really, really hard.If you went onto a dating site and said, ‘look, I am a really nice guy, got my own house, got a good job, but one of the dficulties is that I can’t smile.’Its a bit of a relationship killer before it even gets started.”  But things have turned around for Alex after he found love with Erin. She said: At first, I would never have thought that I would ever fall in love with someone that was born with the same thing I was. But I mean it’s not just the Moebius, we have a lot of other things in common too. It is so nice to have someone that understands me for me.I love his British accent. It makes me melt. It does it just gives me chills. Being unable to smile at each other has meant that Alex and Erin have had to find other ways to communicate their feelings.  Alex explained: I can tell when Erin is happy because she always puts her head on one side and goes “ooh,” and I think although we can’t show facial expression, we know each other’s mannerisms, so when we’re upset or when we’re frustrated or whatever, there is a lot of nonverbal communication that goes on. I think the eyes tell a lot too, even not just Alex, but my family and friends have always said that they can look in my eyes and I smile with my eyes, they know I am happy. The couple have recently spoken to a specialist about the chances of passing on the condition to any future children.  Dr Jonathan Cole, who has studied Moebius syndrome for many years, said: With the genes,it were the same gene that you both had,it was a gene, then that would obviously increase the chance that any child that you had would have Moebius. If you had dferent genes they are likely to be very recessive and rare genes so the chances I would imagine would be less. But then you have to say, well, you have a child with Moebius, so you have a child with Moebius. And there again, who better to take care of a child with moebius, then two parents that have it  But for now, the lovebirds are focusing on their relationship. Alex said: Just having Erin’s hand in my hand, just means the world.It means we don’t have to show any facial expression. And I know when Erin is looking at me that there is a smile inside somewhere. Erin replied: There is a very big smile.- Body Bizarre is on Saturdays at pm on TLC UK.

Ursula Keogh was discovered by police in a river just a few hours after she was reported missing in January this year. The daughter of author and local radio presenter, Nicola Harlow, who said that she received a text from her daughter before she went missing that read: I love you, so sorry. It has now transpired that Ursula, whose mum described as older than her years and sensitive had been looking at suicide sites on Instagram and was self harming at the time. Her family attended the inquest at Bradford Coroners Court and were told by Coroner Martin Fleming that there was going to be a lot to take in, according to ExaminerLive . Ms Harlow told the court that before Ursula had left for school that day she stopped by the door and said: I love you. The post mortem revealed Ursula died from a head injury after she jumped from the bridge.  Ursula, who lived with her mum in Halax, west Yorkshire had a history of self harm. It transpired that in five days before her death she refused to remove her school blazer during a cookery lesson.This led the school to believe she may be self harming. Her dad, David Keogh, was unaware of the pain she was inflicting on herself, but he was worried about her obsession over social media. She had told him about a childs suicide note she had seen online. The court heard that Ursula had got the bus to the bridge with a friend who she gave a sealed envelope which said: do not open until pm. Inside was her suicide note. Ursulas mum told the coroner that she felt fobbed off by her GP after she went to discuss her daughters self destructive behaviour.

Denise Fergus had to wait until the programme went out to learn of its revelations about her little boy’s case at the same time as millions of other viewers. And she was reduced to tears as James Bulger: The New Revelations raked over details of how two-year-old James was tortured to death by -year-olds Jon Venables and Robert Thompson in . She was furious that the Channel  show aired Thompson’s confidential parole papers, which her own legal team had been denied permission to see.  Denise, , said: “I didn’t know what to expect. I was on pins all day before [the broadcast].I didn’t know what I was going to see or hear in it.I felt like I was an outsider looking in on someone ’s story. I was fuming.He is my son, not theirs, and I was not allowed to see what they were saying about him. “I feel like they consider him their property. He is not a property. He was a little boy and he is mine.” Denise says she has complained to show bosses about the documentary, which she believes was too sympathetic towards the murderers. And she is also demanding an inquiry into how the confidential parole papers were broadcast on the show this week.  They contained statements from Thompson, who told of his “shame and revulsion” over the Liverpool murder as he made a bid for freedom in . Denise said: “Why were they allowed to see them and we weren’t  I want to know how they got them.” The Probation Service was not available for comment last night but it is understood bosses do not believe the leak came from their offices. Denise also felt the programme was biased towards the killers. She said: “I just felt it was all one-sided. They tried their best to get sympathy for them two.” And she felt it went into too much grisly detail, adding: “When they started going into detail about what they did to James, that’s when I had to leave the room.People know the details. They don’t need to hear it all the time. They didn’t have to do that. “I kept telling myself, ‘Don’t break, carry on watching, just get through this’, but it got too much in the end.”  After watching with husband Stuart, , at their home in Kirkby, Merseyside, Denise tweeted: “I’m upset, fuming with the one-sided sympathy with the evil killers of my beautul son.”Yesterday she added: “I think they’d already made their minds up about what they were going to show.” Thompson and Venables, now , were convicted  years ago this month over the murder of James and released on licence aged  with new secret identities.Thompson has led a largely unknown le since his release in . Venables is serving  months for possessing child abuse images, his second term for the offence.

The tributes have been taken from the family grave of Steve and Pat Russell and their daughters Kerry and Kirsty nearly every week for the past seven months. A friend of the family hid a camera in a tree at the cemetery in Hull and captured images of a man picking up flowers and leaving on a bicycle. The friend told Hull Live that none of the other graves nearby have been disturbed, so this is personal.  Both Steve and Pat suffered the agony of losing their children Kerry and Kirsty at a young age due to a heart condition. Kerry died at the age of  after collapsing at school  years ago. Kirsty suffered from the same condition and died in  at the age of . Four years ago, Pat died after suffering a heart attack and her husband passed away a year later. Their ashes were placed at Eastern Cemetery in Hull underneath a rose bush next to their two daughters.  Allan Hiley, , from Halax, West Yorkshire, was “horried” when he was told by friends that someone was taking the flowers from their grave. He said: “Its the grave of my auntie and uncle and their two daughters. I come over every now and again to visit the grave and friends who knew them. They rang me up a while ago to tell me someone was taking the flowers and decorations. I was horried. “The love that family had between them was incredible and the fact that someone could be doing that to their grave is a farce.  “I was upset about it. They were a lovely family. They are not resting in peace because of this.” Friends of the family became concerned back in April with the missing flowers and decided that it was time to figure out what was going on. They placed a camera in a tree looking over the grave. One person, who did not wish to be named, said: “My we and her friends all visit the grave every week or so to put down flowers and other decorative items to make the grave look nice.  “We started to notice back in April that things were going missing and rang each other to figure out what was going on. Every so often we would go there and they were gone. “There are graves either side and around it that don’t get touched so this is personal. It’s just disgusting. Why would you do that to a grave  I can’t get my head around it. “Someone suggested to me to put a camera there to catch who was doing it. So I purchased one and hid it in a nearby tree.” On September  the camera had recorded footage of a man no one could recognise visiting the grave. He can be seen standing in front of the plot with his bicycle before picking up a bunch of flowers and tipping the water on the ground.Pictures taken by the camera also show the flowers missing from the grave two minutes after he arrived. The footage was reported to Humberside Police. The same man was seen again visiting the grave on the evening of November , and shortly after his arrival the flowers were no longer there.

The businessman claims his back was injured after having to sit next to the overweight inidual. Stephen Prosser, , who works as a company director, claims he suffered soft tissue damage after the man wedged himself into the seat next to him. The pair were given seats by BA next to each other on the -hour flight from Bangkok airport in Thailand to London Heathrow on January , . Mr Prosser, who is only ft in, claims that the obese passenger was so large that his body fat spilled into his seat by several inches.  The freelance civil engineer said he was crushed against the side of the plane by a ft in man weighing -stone. His lawyers say Mr Prosser was forced to adjust his body and sit in an awkward and uncomfortable position for the whole  hour and  minute flight. Mr Prosser says he was left suffering symptoms from his injuries for the following three months - and is now seeking damages. But British Airways deny the claims - stating Mr Prosser did not not display any signs of injury when leaving the flight. Dad-of-two Mr Prosser said: Id spent Christmas  with some friends in Thailand and was ing home on January , . Id paid over pound, for the flight and usually I fly Thai Airways but because BA had a sale on and were cheaper I went with them. Just as the plane door was about to close, this ft in elk, weighing about -stone got on-board and sat between myself and another passenger who had the aisle seat. He was a huge bloke, not just overweight but really big boned as well. He was a real lump. I felt discomfort as soon as he sat down because I was pinned against the side of the cabin. Im only about ft in and weigh  stone. I suffered problems with my posture -years ago when I used to drive to Kent for work every week so I knew I was in trouble straight away. As soon as the plane had taken off and we were allowed out of our seats I took the matter up with the flight attendants. I asked whether they could move him or move me but it was a full flight and they decided not to move me to a crew members seat because Id have to keep on getting up to allow them to get to the galley.  They said there wasnt anything they could do so I said I wanted to make a formal complaint which I did with the on-board customer services rep. I had no choice but to go back to my seat and the discomfort at being squashed up against the cabin soon turned to agony. To be honest the big guy looked in pain himself as he had his knees wedged into the seat in front so I didnt want to bother him personally. I think its up to the staff to take control of a situation like that and they should have asked the passenger on the aisle seat to swap with the larger man in the middle. But they didnt and I ended up doing a lot of damage to my back over the course of a nightmare -hours. Mr Prosser says he continued to see a chiropractor up until May this year. Defence documents to the claim show Mr Prosser was sitting in a window seat on the plane and the obese passenger was in the middle seat. Immediately after take-off Mr Prosser asked to speak to the Customer Service Manager and refused to sit in his seat. The airline manager was under the impression he wanted an upgrade and told him the flight was full. Mr Prosser told the manager he would have back pain and would not be able to go to workhe wasnt moved. But the manager found the comments surprising after it was less than half an hour after take-off.  The manager said the passenger next to Mr Prosser was well built and over six feet tall, but certainly not fat. British Airways say the passenger did not have fat which was spilling over the arm rest. Mr Prosser, of Tonypandy, South Wales, was offered extra pillows and blankets to support his back - which he accepted. He is claiming between pound, and pound, as general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity. The case is set to be heard at Pontypridd County Court on Friday. Before the hearing, a spokeswoman for BA said: As the case is subject to ongoing proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.

Instead of passing on germs, experts say that the habit may result in the “transfer of healthy micro-organisms” to their young offspring. The study, by Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, involved interviews with  mothers. Of the  per cent who reported their child currently using a dummy,  per cent said the parents sucked the dummy to clean it.  The author of the small American study said they found those children to have lower levels of Immunoglobulin E , an antibody related to allergic responses in the body. High IgE levels typically indicate a greater risk of having allergies and allergic asthma, lead author Eliane Abou-Jaoude said. Co-author Edward Zoratti said: We found that parental pacier sucking was linked to suppressed IgE levels beginning around  months, and continued through  months.

It is unclear whether the lower IgE production seen among these children continues into later years.  Scientists cautioned that the study, being presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and ImmunologyAnnual Scientic Meeting in Seattle, required more research. Dr Abou-Jaoude said that while it indicated an association between parental pacier sucking and children with lower IgE levels, it does not necessarily mean the practice itself causes the lower levels.

It will feel like -C in London by next Thursday, -C Birmingham, Manchester -, while Scotland will feel the coldest with a wind chill of -, according to Net Weather . The rest of the week will will see temperatures hover at around C as wintery conditions begin to take hold.  Martin Bowles, an Operational Meteorologist with the Met Office, told : Temperatures will be below average and the top of the mountains in northern Scotland might well get snow. There will be some light frosts quite widely around the country. We will start to get an east wind from Poland and Russia, so while the official temperature is C, it will feel like C or C sometimes. it will be quite cold.” Forecasters warn the UK could be hit by bitter blizzards at the end of the month.  The blizzards could bring fierce snowfall, plummeting temperatures and severe transport disruption. Piers Corbyn, forecaster for WeatherAction, said: “An active low-pressure system will move in from the northwest next week signalling a change to much colder conditions. “We are expecting this to bring some early winter weather with heavy snow and very cold winds in the north and a risk of wintry showers even across southern Britain.” The plume of freezing air, which is to sweep in from Scandinavia, could linger throughout December and into , forecasters say. Mr Corbyn added: “This pattern is likely to hold out through the rest of the month and into December with a risk of blizzards in Scotland and the north and widespread snow showers.  “There will be a risk of travel disruption through this period with volatile, stormy weather combined with the cold brining a risk of winter thunderstorms and outbreaks of thunder snow. “What we are looking at is a pattern of circulation similar to that which was observed during the mini ice-age.” The historic Mini Ice Age which occurred during the mid-th century and saw Britons hold frost fairs on the frozen River Thames.

Amanda Robertson, , was in and out of hospital as she suffered from severe headaches, nosebleeds and vomiting. Her parents Caroline and Monty say she underwent a CT scan and she was sent home with painkillers after a neurologist said her headache was caused by trapped nerves. But the parents say opportunities to spot the benign tumour on the scan - and provide treatment that would have saved her - were missed. Theyve now accused NHS bosses of killing their daughter and received a settlement over the case, Daily Record reports.  A report found that Amanda would have had a  per cent chance of survival had the tumour been spotted on the CT scan, which was performed after four hospital admissions in nine months The parents, who cared for their daughter full-time at home due to her autism, said they pleaded with staff to perform an MRI scan. But they claim it was only agreed to weeks later when Amandas condition took a turn for the worse. Amanda died at home less than a week before the scheduled appointment, on September ,  - just six days before her scan at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. The parents say their grief was compounded when it was later established the tumour could have been spotted at the time of the first CT scan. This month, four years after Amandas death, her parents have won legal action against NHS Highland and spoke publicly for the first time. Caroline, , said: Its hard enough dealing with the death of your child, but when its caused by the very professionals who are there to help then it makes it all the worse. Amanda would still be alivestaff at Raigmore simply did their job.  As far as were concerned NHS Highland killed our daughter and ripped our world apart. I was very scared about what was happening to her. She was in a lot of pain and couldnt get out of bed - my husband and I basically carried her into hospital. Seeing her suffer was agonising and left us all in a constant state of fear. Your mind starts going round and round and you dont know what to think or do. We were also in a catch  because the hospital kept letting us down but we had nowhere  to go. In December , Amanda told her GP she was suffering from headaches, nosebleeds, balance issues and a suspected lump in the back of her head, her parents said. They said she was referred to an ENT consultant who removed a nasal ulcer in February  and suggested sinus issues were the cause of the headaches. But on July , her headaches ed so the same specialist ordered a CT scan. A fortnight later, on July , she was given the all clear, her parents say. But the vomiting and headaches continued and after Amandas lips turned white on July , she was readmitted to hospital. On August  a neurologist from NHS Highland examined her and diagnosed occipital nerve neuralgia , the Robertsons said.  Amanda was scheduled to be released three days later but on August  was violently sick, and a doctor who witnessed her distress pushed for an MRI scan to be carried out, her parents said. When a date of September  was planned, Caroline said she complained it was too long to wait and urged for an earlier appointment to be booked. Amanda died at home six days before her scan, with the cause of death was confirmed as a tumour on the central nervous system within the brain, her parents say. The family, from Alness, Ross and Cromarty, complained to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman who ruled thatthe tumour had been discovered in July or early August it would have been operable. A report said there would have been a  per cent chance of recovery from the benign tumour. NHS Highland was given  recommendations to improve patient care and was criticised for its lack of focus on the failings and ways to improve their services. The General Medical Council also investigated the family GP who failed to spot the early warning signs and handed down advice. Amandas dad Monty, , a retired oil rig fabricator, added: We begged that neurologist for an MRI and he said there was no need - then he just left. The hospital had loads of chances and time to act but did nothing. We cannot allow this kind of flippant approach to healthcare to go unchecked. Anyone who played a part in Amandas death needs to be held to account, at the very least so that standards improve and other families dont go through what we have. NHS Highland can no longer pretend to care about people - not when they refuse to help then drag innocent people through legal processes. Sue Grant, partner at Digby Brown Solicitors and head of clinical negligence, helped secure an undisclosed settlement for the Robertson family. She said: This was a very tragic and traumatic experience for the Robertson family. It would be inappropriate to comment on their case but I can confirm their civil action has now concluded and I hope they may now be able to rebuild their future. NHS Highland has been contacted for comment.

But his small British team had remarkable success against the murderous drug cartels in Colombia. The ex-VAT inspector’s unit could not compete in terms of size with the US authorities fighting the same battle. Yet the Brits masterminded the seizure of a record poundbillion worth of drugs. And while the gung-ho American narcotics agents publicly bragged about triumphs, Tom and his team went about things in a typically understated British way by keeping their exploits quiet. Only now is he lting the lid on his time in capital Bogota, starting in .  Speaking to the Mirror in a London pub, Tom said: “We were the British equivalent of Narcos. Everyone’s heard of the DEA [the US Drug Enforcement Administration] and the US agencies doing their stuff in Colombia, and the reason is because they talk about it. “They would say after a seizure that it was down to the DEA in Bogota and straight away the bad guys would go looking for the informant. “We never claimed a single result. No one even knew the Brits were there, because we didn’t want them to. We weren’t egotists. “Our idea was to let others take the credit and keep our heads down. The DEA were looking for glory. This is the first time the British story has been told.”  Now in his s, Tom grew up in Seaham, Co Durham. He joined HM Customs and Excise after studying languages, in the hope of finding adventure abroad. But he was sent to be a VAT inspector in Birmingham. When bosses gave him the job as a drug liaison officer in Bogota  years ago, it was in violent chaos. Weeks earlier Medellin Cartel boss Pablo Escobar – responsible for an estimated , to , deaths during a reign of terror that included the bombing of Avianca Flight , which claimed  lives in  – had been killed by police in a rooftop shootout. The Cali Cartel then took over as the dominant cocaine gang. The Americans, who had dozens of DEA officers there, aimed to take out the top brass of the cartels, one by one.  Tom could not replicate this because the UK did not have the resources there – he had just a handful of staff. Instead he wooed informants – including a prostitute who gleaned information during pillow talk – and found out about shipments before they left. Targeting the ports was something that had never been done. Based in the British embassy, Tom and his network penetrated the crews who raced coke-laden speed boats across the Caribbean sea and identied “motherships” carrying tonnes of the drug to Europe.  Tom – not his real name – developed a network of  informants who helped to intercept  tonnes of drugs. No investigator in history is thought to have been behind more seizures. Corruption was re. Workers were being offered – as Escobarsays in the hit Netflix drama series Narcos, “plata o plomo” – meaning, silver or lead. Most took the money rather than the bullet, so Tom had to offer cash. He added: “The Cali and North Valley cartels were the biggest organised crime groups in history. “Their intelligence services were so far ahead of anything that any other country had in that region, let alone crime organisation. The capabilities of the bad guys was terrying.  Tom, who has revealed his story in his new book Narco Wars, arranged customs training courses as a cover for meeting port staff, and urged them to work for the British government. After spending months grooming a customs inspector in the port of Cartagena, Tom asked the man for information and got a chilling reply. The man said: “If you repeat what you have said to me to anyone  around here, it will get you killed. “You are a nice guy. So I’m going to forget what you said and pretend that I never heard it... I think you are going to get yourself killed.”  While Tom survived, others did not. A key informant was shot dead by hitmen after a friend betrayed him. Tom said: “He had a we and kids, and he didn’t deserve to die. To some extent I was to blame.” Drug lords vowed to hunt down “the Brit” as he became known, but Tom rejected calls toto the UK. He said: “London said come home for six months... but I had invested so much work building up the sources. If I went home I might lose them. I had to plead with London to let me carry on.” It all ended in the early s, when new laws made handling informants impossible abroad. Stopping the flow of drugs into the UK is now down to the National Crime Agency. Recent figures show drug seizures are down to the lowest level in  years. And while alleged Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is on trial in the US, Tom believes the war on drugs has failed. He added: “A lot of [my] friends have died. Was it worth it  No, because we are no better off... The war will not be won with bullets. It can only be won through education and mass media and social media campaigns. These are our most powerful weapons.”Narco Wars is published by Milo Books, priced pound.."},{"url":null,"title":"woman who thought vampire tv","story":"NewsWoman who thought she was Vampire Diaries character stabs werewolf lover in chestThe Vampire Diaries fan Ekaterina Tirskaya told the victim she was on a mission to kill werewolves and kned him as he got out of the bathShareCommentsByWill Stewart:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsEkaterina Tirskaya, , has been jailed for attacking the man with a kne \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who thought she was a vampire from a long-running TV series stabbed her new lover in the chest thinking he was a werewolf, it is claimed. Ekaterina Tirskaya, , told police that she believed she was Elena Gilbert, a fictional character in US television fantasy drama The Vampire Diaries. She and her lover had slept together for the first time after meeting on social media, a court was told. The victim told her that he didn’t believe in the supernatural, and urged her to go home. But she grabbed a kne and attacked him as he was getting out of the bath, according to reports.  Tirskaya, from Novosibirsk, Russia, has been jailed for the kne attack. Psychological assessments ahead of her trial in Siberia found the hair treatment specialist to be sane, it was reported. The morning after sleeping with the man, the woman suddenly “changed”, telling him she was a vampire and like Elena Gilbert, played by Canadian actress Nina Dobrev, she had a mission to kill werewolves.  One report said: “She grabbed a kne in the kitchen and suddenly attacked him when he was getting out of the bath. “He managed to get hold of the kne. “But she grabbed another one and stabbed him in the chest.”  He staggered out of his flat and banged on neighbours doors pleading for help. They called an ambulance and police. The man was gravely wounded but survived the February attack. Prosecutor Felix Kuznetsov said Tirskaya was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison after being found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm. She was also ordered to pay pound, in “moral damages” to her stabbed lover.

For the -plus who travelled to watch the weekend win at Ross County, it might be well nigh impossible.Because at the Global Energy Stadium on Saturday, Neilson’s Tangerines looked every inch the kind of side that finish top of this notoriously dficult of leagues. That was largely down to there being nothing pretty about this win.Under McKinnon, Laszlo and even Neilson already, United have shown when it comes to quality football,everything clicks there’s not a team in the second tier who can live with them.They can pass any side off the park, keep possession and conjure enough chances to comfortably win a game.For all but a few sides with genuine aspirations to win the Championship, however, that’s seldom enough. This is a ision where the team finishing first must also have the ability to grind out wins.It’s what St Mirren did last season, Hibs the one before and even Rangers found they had to be able to do as they got up two years ago.Even Neilson’s young Hearts side that galloped away with the title in  did, on the few occasions when necessary, show they could dig deep and battle for points.Now, and arguably for the first time since they dropped down from the top flight, it’s a quality United possess.They ended County’s nine-game unbeaten home run since the start of the campaign, not through playing the kind of football of which we know they’re capable, but by standing up to the physical challenge that’s always posed by the home side up there.Yes, United had to do plenty defending, but through a clear game plan, organisation and a willingness of players to put their bodies on the line, it was executed so well that, for all their territorial dominance, the Staggies had very few clear sights of goal.A nice bonus stemming from that fact was, for the first time in his short tenure, in the build-up to the game injuries were a signicant issue.Frederic Frans and Callum Booth were doubts last week and unable to train with the rest of the squad until a Friday session confirmed they wouldn’t make it. In William Edjenguele and Paul Watson, the manager found able deputies.He’s said since he arrived at Tannadice winning promotion would take a squad of highly committed players.He now knows he has that

few and far between, manager Jim McIntyre has urged his midfield to provide more goal threat.And Kamara, who has been pushed further forward by his new boss lately, says he has ambitions to add some club goals to his single international effort.“I’d say I’ve had about one shot in my time at Dundee!” the former Arsenal man said.“I definitely need to shoot more and try to help out the team with goals, it is something I’m working on.”And despite firing in a goal for his country that sealed victory over the Greeks, Kamara wasn’t overly proud by the quality of his first touch.He said: “What was the goal like  Don’t watch it!“I made a really bad touch into a good touch and a finish.“It was great, something I didn’t expect but I was buzzing after it.“It’s a great feeling to score for your country and we got a - win over Greece as well.“They are coming up again so we’ll have to be ready again.”Ranked th in the world and below upcoming opponents Greece and Hungary in the world rankings, the Finns’ record of four wins from their first four Nations League games have surprised onlookers.However, Kamara insists nobody within the camp is surprised at how well they’ve fared.Under manager Markku Kanerva, the Eagle Owls as they are nicknamed, have spread their wings and begun to fly after years in the international wilderness following the retirement of former Ajax great and Liverpool forward Jari Litmanen.That’s despite a lack of household names with Norwich striker Teemu Pukki most likely to be known to football fans on these shores after an unsuccessful spell at Celtic.Momentum is building, however, and the Finns will be hopeful of finding a backdoor route to Euro  through winning their Nations League group.That needs at least one point from tonight’s trip to Athens or the game against Hungary in Budapest on Sunday.Kamara said: “The team is in a good place, the manager is doing well and they are a good group of boys.“Things are going well in the Nations League and we have a good chance of winning our group.“We have Greece and Hungary up this week and with a win I’d say we’ll top the group.“That’s maybe surprised a few people but the team knew we were good enough after playing a few games together and,you watch us, you can see we are at a good level right now.”Kamara’s Dundee team-mate Benjamin Kallman has also featured for the full national side this year, though is more often involved with the U  squad.He remains at Dens Park this week as the young Finns don’t have any fixtures scheduled."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

It was the first time we’ve performed an entire set of all our own work, which was pretty special.#Kirsteen said: #MOJO and the reception we got performing our own music for the first time was very special.#When asked where they would most like to perform, there was some surprisingly touching answers.Alana said: #I personally would love to play in Nashville, the country capital in the Bluebird Cafe.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same

UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-live-gove-to-stay-as-environment-secretary-as-pm-quizzed-by-public","story":"Michael Gove will be not be resigning from the Cabinet, sources have said, as the Prime Minister took part in an LBC radio phone-in and fielded questions on Brexit from members of the public.Herersquos the latest:.amWhen asked letters of no confidence had been received by the  Committee as he left his Westminster home on Friday morning, Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ldquoWersquoll see and raised his eyebrows.Jacob Rees-Mogg outside his home in Westminster .amHouse of Commons speaker John Bercow joked about ldquoquiet, uneventful times inn Westminster as he attended a charity tennis event in Stratford-upon-Avon.Mr Bercow travelled to Warwickshire to play against his friend Chris Onslow, a local tennis enthusiast who is playing for  hours non-stop to raise money for Children in Need and Welcombe Hills School..amMichael Gove will remain in post as Environment Secretary and ldquothinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best outcome for the country, a source close to him told PA..amFollowing Mrs Mayrsquos comparison of her Brexit approach with the playing style of Geoffrey Boycott, Conservative MP Greg Hands commented that the PMrsquos cricketing hero was once deliberately run out by a member of his own side ndash Ian Botham ndash for the good of the team.Interesting passage from Leo McKinstryrsquos biography of Geoff Boycott when the England team had to run out their own captainfor the benefit of the team.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree. This subsequently became a feature of part of the cellar, known since as ldquoThe Hawthorn Room.Legend has it that the tree has magical qualities which have on more than one occasion saved the castle from disaster.Modern scientic analysis has revealed that the tree died in approximately , most likely as a result of being deprived of light because the castle had been built around it. The other surprise  It is a holly tree, not a hawthorn.

But it was Mrs May that ruled out freedom of movement, so that meant outside the single market, and so on.In Strasbourg this week Ive done a tonne of media and had meetings with fellow MEPs to re-emphasise Scotlands view on Brexit. Across the board the response of our European friends is \"what the hell is the UK *doing* \"They respect the process that has led us to the result, but they do not understand why the UK has behaved as it has since.

Some estimates say more than , ethnic Tamils were massacred.These wartime atrocities and allegations of corruption and nepotism consistently marred Mr Rajapaksarsquos presidency.Last month however on October , the alliance between Mr Sirisena and Mr Wickremesinghe formally crumbled, with Mr Sirisena naming Mr Rajapaksa the new prime minister and suspending Parliament.After a week of upheaval that included street protests, Mr Sirisena announced he was dissolving Parliament and calling snap elections due on January .Since then Mr Wickremesinghe has been holed up in the prime ministerrsquos official residence in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, maintaining he is the countryrsquos rightful leader and repeatedly calling for Parliament to be reconvened so that he could prove his majority support among the countryrsquos  politicians.This week the crisis deepened even further after Sri Lankarsquos politicians passed a no-confidence motion against purported Prime Minister MrRajapaksa.His allies however have now refused to recognise the legitimacy of this weekrsquos vote, further fuelling the uncertainty of the past weeks and leaving it unclear who,anyone, is currently Sri Lankarsquos lawful prime minister.It would be wrong to underestimate just how signicant this crisis is, given that its outcome will likely determine the future course of democracy in Sri Lanka, a country still struggling with the legacy of its bitter -year civil war that ended in .Already a number of international human rights groups and conflict monitors have flagged up the dangers in President Sirisenarsquos efforts to impose Mr Rajapaksa as prime minister.According to Alan Keenan an analyst at the conflict monitoring think-tank International Crisis Group , Mr Sirisenarsquos actions were ldquoillegal, with the result that ldquoSri Lankarsquos democracy is at stake.ldquoRajapaksa appears to be in a strong position. He has the backing of the president and the sympathy of the police and army. The longer he controls the state, the more likely it is for him to win the vote when parliament convenes, Mr Keenan said recently.While this weeksrsquos motion aimed at removing Mr Rajapaksa and his cabinet from their posts is a boost to sacked incumbent Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, few expect Mr Rajapaksa will take such a move lying down and many fear the worst may yet be about come in this bitter contest between the two men. For his part Mr Wickremesinghe remains undaunted.ldquoIf anyone wants to challenge the speakerrsquos decision they can put it to a vote, he insisted yesterday.ldquoWe will now take steps to ensure that the government in place before Oct  will continue, he later posted on Twitter.Just who precisely is prime minister though still remains unclear, adding to confusion over who controls the army and other state bodies. As the stand-off continues and tensions rise itrsquos not just Sri Lankans that are looking on nervously.The US, UK, and other powers have raised concerns over the crisis in this strategically important island nation of  million people. For behind the struggle for power inside the country a bigger tussle for economic power between India and China is going on.The big fear for India is that Sri Lanka, just off its southern coast and on one of the worldrsquos busiest maritime routes, could become a Chinese military outpost.ldquoIndia can ill-afford to ignore the strategic advantage China has gained in Sri Lanka so close to peninsular India, was how Colonel R. Hariharan, a retired Indian Army intelligence officer summed up the threat recently.In Colombo, Chinese companies are constructing a . billion new commercial district, including hotels, marinas and a motor racing track, and have already built a giant container terminal nearby and a huge port in the south.This economic backdrop has only exacerbated the current leadership crisis in Sri Lanka where the issue of how far to accommodate Indian interests has been a signicant factor.While Mr Wickremesinghe is seen to lean more towards New Delhi Mr Rajapaksa has long been regarded as more pro-China. For the moment both giant countries have remained comparatively quiet on the current crisis.Earlier this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered to moderate in discussions, urging the Sri Lankan government to respect ldquodemocratic processes and institutions.So far his offer has fallen on deaf ears."},{"url":null,"title":"third-of-eu-doctors-look-at-moving-out-due-to-brexit","story":"Doctorsrsquo leaders at the British Medical Associationwarned such an exodus ldquowould be a disaster for the health service.The BMA survey also found  per cent of European doctors working in Scotland are ldquounconvinced promises made about their rights would be protectedthe UK quits the European Union without a deal.That proportion was higher than the % who were not convinced by this across the UK as a whole.BMA Scotland chairman Dr Lewis Morrison said: ldquoAs Brexit creeps ever closer, it is appalling that so many of our colleagues are living with such uncertainty over what their future will be.ldquoThe results of this survey clearly show a deep distrust in the promises that have been made to date.More than , doctors working in the UK who had been trained in Europe completed the survey, including  currently working in Scotland.But more than a thirdof these doctors north of the Border said they were not aware of the UKrsquos settled status scheme for European citizens currently living and working in the UK, while % said they are considering moving abroad.Dr Morrison said: ldquoWe should be absolutely clear that losing the contribution to our NHS of doctors from where in Europe would be a disaster for our health service.ldquoThese are our friends and our colleagues and with just a handful of months to go, too many of them do not know what their future will be afterBrexit.The survey was carried out between the end of September and the beginning of November, before Theresa Mayrsquos Government agreed a Brexit deal with the EU. But with a number of ministers having quit the Government after a crunch Cabinet meeting, it is by no means certain the Prime Minister will be able to get the agreement approved by Parliament.Dr Morrison said: ldquoA clear and unequivocal guarantee, setting out in detail how the rights of EEA nationals will be protected in the event of a no-deal Brexit, is urgently required.ldquoThe Scottish Government has been clear that it wants to protect the rights of European NHS staff and this is welcome and appreciated by many, but it is ultimately the Westminster Government that must act before further damage is done.Last night, Scottish Labour MSP Neil Findlay, the party spokesman on Brexit, said the survey was ldquoyet more evidence of the need for a General Election.He said: ldquoHere is yet more evidence of the impact of the Toriesrsquo chaotic Brexit shambles.

The Spice Girls approach to feminism was always at pains to be palatable but it doesnt do to overthink them, for ones own equilibrium.Carrying on the tradition, Emma Bunton says the band is, rather than all about Girl Power, now about \"people power.\"Opining on the most serious situation Britain has faced in my letime, the Spice Girls are calling for unity. \"Wersquore about equality and bringing everyone together, she says. And thus, the band is concerned about Brexit. Fortunately, Ms Horner, using the skills honed during her -plus years as international ambassador for the UNs population fund, is on hand to help out.\"Britain,\" she says, digging out a replica Union flag dress and standing tall, \"Come together, whatever it is. We donrsquot have to agree on politics, itrsquos bigger than that.\"You can just support a woman doing the best she can and thatrsquos it. Not an easy position.\"Its not an easy position, Geri, is it. Nor a position entirely without its problems.Horner is somewhat famed for her admiration of Britains first female Prime Minister, \"the first Spice Girl, the pioneer of our ideology\". There is much about the Spice Girls message that is conservative: inidualism not co-operation a focus on making money pro-British, anti-EU the pursuit of capitalism.At the death of Margaret Thatcher, Horner tweeted in her praise, was lambasted and deleted the tweet. She later publicly chided herself for doing so, saying she had failed to show the same strength of character as her heroine.Unlike Mrs Thatcher, the lady was - altogether now - for turning.Ms Horners latest trite pseudo-profound warbling is that high-achieving women are automatically positive role models, regardless of the impact of their achievements on women collectively. But not all female success is by default feminist.Its the logic supporting former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albrights famous \"theres a special place in hell for women who dont support other women.\" I see Ms Albrights stance and raise her Katie Hopkins.The logical end to that would be that I am compelled to support the Janus-faced Horner - she who has both pinched the bum of Prince Charlesand acted as UN Goodwill Ambassador - and Im afraid I do not.Mrs Albright used her catchphrase in relation to Presidential candidate Hilary Clinton during the US elections of .Mrs Clinton herself refused to heed this advice when she criticised Monica Lewinsky recently, denying her husbands affair while in office constituted an abuse of power. An intern, lest we need reminded, and the President of the United States.Mrs Clinton also chose to back the incumbent Andrew M Cuomo over his challenger Cynthia Nixon in New Yorkrsquos Democratic gubernatorial primary. What would Ms Horner make of it all In a way, she is correct. Feminism is an obligation to support and help other women. It is a willingness to lt other women up, mentor women, promote them, evenit means putting oneself out.It is not, though, a case of unquestioningly promoting other women at any cost.It is desperately patronising to suggest that the simple fact of being female is a bridge that should cross any political isions, any ideological ide, between women. It does, in fact, do far more harm to not contest or contradict women who are doing great damage to other women.The Spice Girls turned heads for being unabashedly bombastic. Mel B once compared the bands musical petition for girl power with Nelson Mandelas decades-long anti-apartheid fight. Whats the opposite of imposter syndrome Tthe bands great power came from their insistence of friendships taking priority over romantic relationships.During the interview praising Theresa May, Melanie C chips in to compliment the politicians dance techniques. This is a position I can back. There was a distinct whf of bullying in the response to the Prime Ministers attempts to move to the music. We all cringed but they who who wouldnt cut some mad shapes while under pressure to be rhythmic may cast the first stone.The message of friendship is perhaps one Ms Horner could apply to her relationship with the questionable Mrs May. Harriet Harmans verdict on Mrs May was that, \"Shes a woman - but no sister.\"It is possible to be friends and disagree, it is possible to be sisters and disagree. We can, say, vehemently oppose a womans politics while not mocking her dancing.A woman in power is not necessarily a positive force and it is distinctly unfeminist to suggest women shouldnt speak out to say so."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-branded-modern-day-chamberlain-during-radio-phone-in","story":"Appearing on LBCs Nick Ferrari Show, Mrs May was told to quit, make way for Jacob Rees-Mogg and even compared to former premier Neville Chamberlain, notorious for his policy of appeasement towards Hitler.Caller John, from Gillingham, labelled Mrs May a \"modern-day Chamberlain\", the prime minister who famously claimed to have secured \"peace for our time\" in negotiations with Hitler, only for the Second World War to break out the following year.John asked the Prime Minister: \"Do you consider yourself the modern-day Chamberlain, who also went to Europe and negotiated with a foreign power and came back having appeased that foreign power and not stood up for our country \"I would like you to stand up for our country and stand up for whats best for our country.

There is still time to sort this out.\"Mrs May responded by going through details of the draft withdrawal agreement.She said: \"Youre absolutely right that for a lot of people who voted Leave, what they wanted to do was make sure that decisions on things like who can come into this country would be taken by us here in the UK, and not by Brussels, and thats exactly what the deal Ive negotiated delivers.\"LBC phone-in caller Gary, from Acton in west London, said that it appeared the EU had \"got the better deal\" in negotiations, and asked Mrs May: \"Dont you think Jacob Rees-Mogg is the person to lead us at the moment \"She replied: \"A lot of people look at this and think the only side thats given anything is the UK. Actually thats not the case.\"Mrs May said that the EU had initially wanted the European Court of Justice to have jurisdiction in a wide range of areas of UK le following Brexit.\"We are very clear that that cannot be the case, and thats what weve negotiated,\" she said.\"There are other areas too where the EU has felt that a particular approach is right and weve said no. Weve held out, weve held our ground and theyve given in to us.\"But its a negotiation and any negotiation, complex as it is, is actually a negotiation which leads to compromises.\"However, some callers were supportive of the Prime Minister, with Michael from Derry in Northern Ireland supporting the deal and Ellen, from Alicante in Spain, saying she had been left in the lurch by Brexiteers.Michael said: \"Im from the North and when we voted in the majority to Remain, myself included, I actually feel the Prime Ministers deal will be of huge benefit to the region.\"Can the Prime Minister give any reassurance that the bespoke deal wont be scuppered by her confidence and supply partners, the DUP \"Mrs May explained there were complications over the Northern Irish border but said she believed she had got the best deal possible and hoped MPs would act in the national interest.And British expat Ellen told the PM she had \"every sympathy\" for her as she endured criticism from her hard Brexit colleagues.\"Those people who started this all off have all walked away and left you to it and they just want to stand on the sidelines shouting,\" she told Mrs May.Responding to Ellens concern about the status of expats living in EU countries in the case of a no-deal Brexit, Mrs May said: \"If theres no deal, I have said that EU citizens living here in the UK will have their rights protected, and I would expect other countries in the EU to do the same for UK citizens living in their countries.\"I would hope that other countries will show the same respect for people whove chosen to live .\""},{"url":null,"title":"council to consider setting wheels in motion for kintore blackburn link","story":"A new #, pedestrian and cycle route linking Kintore and Blackburn is expected to be approved by councillors.Aberdeenshire Council has been providing new facilities along the A corridor for cyclists on a phased basis.Phase one began in  with a shared use path linking Kintore to the town’s business park, while phase two works have recently been completed linking Kintore with Inverurie.That route is already proving a hit with pedestrians, with an average of  daily users recorded during October.Now the local authority is seeking a decision on a favoured option for phase three works to provide a shared use path between Kintore and Blackburn.In a paper to the Garioch Area Committee which meets tomorrow , infrastructure services director Stephen Archer says the route would essentially provide a facility for cyclists wishing to commute onwards to Aberdeen.Discussions are currently ongoing with Aberdeen City Council with a view to the creation of a connection from the city to Blackburn.Mr Archer will report: “The proposal to develop the phase three works was included on the Procurement Work Plan which was approved at the Infrastructure Services Committee of March , .“A successful grant application was subsequently made to the Sustrans Community Links Programme and a % funding commitment has been made by Sustrans for the project.”A feasibility study was undertaken to identy four potential routes, with option two running adjacent to and north of the A and south via the A underpass being favoured by officers.Mr Archer continues: “While the report does not make a definitive recommendation on which route to take forward, on the basis of cost, implementation and socio-economic impact, option two is regarded as being the overall best value option.“It is therefore requested that option two is now taken forward for detailed design to create a design and tender package before the end of the current financial year that would allow the council to approach funding partners for construction funding for future years.”He will also indicate that while the third option of using the old turnpike road would perhaps not fulfil the requirements for a commuting route, it could have some value as a recreational resource to the council.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local piper Michael Mackay played at Inveruries Keithhall Road cemetary\"  Inverurie piper pays tribute to the fallenviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Naomi is looking for a home.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amUnder s have until midnight this Sunday to enter Orkney#s heat of the Rotary Young Musician Competition.

Descendants of both Vice Admiral Fremantle and Rear Admiral von Reuter will be attending the conference.The conference will cover not only the scuttle, but also the history and impact of that fateful day.Speakers will explore the American navy#s vital role in the war, how the scuttle was interpreted in Germany and how the legacy still lives on today.Six months before the centenary itself, this will be a wonderful opportunity to share Scapa#s history, stimulate ideas for  and build a lasting knowledge of what happened and why.Nick Jellicoe will publish two books next year: The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet and, in partnership with the Orcadian, Scuttle to Salvage, a book about in photographs.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Buses will be the initial target of the pollution crackdown, with an increasing proportion having to have the cleanest diesel engines to use the zone.For First Glasgow, clean diesel, rather than electric, is the “only show in town” when electrics can only manage  miles before having being charged for four hours, when a typical route involves  miles a day.: Alastair Dalton: Failure to curb cars in cities is throttling busesIt said electric buses were three times the price of diesel ones, at about £, each, and you would never recoup the dference in lower running costs.But the worry must be that while the technology is evolving, there could be repeats of the situation in Glasgow, where the city’s only electric service was threatened with the closure because operator Garelochhead Coaches said the cost of running it had become prohibitive because the four-year-old vehicles’ warranty had run out.Electric buses are smoother and will cut pollution where it matters, such as around passengers waiting at bus stops.But there are likely to be a number of jolts to come on the road to buses becoming greener as well as more attractive to passengers.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4830460.1542310923!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie tv bosses discover formula to make us all get netflix anxiety disorder","story":"Netflix Anxiety Disorder # the social pressure to watch TV box sets # has replaced obsessional interest in music and trainers as the way to define whether you are cool or not, writes Kevan Christie.“Have you seen Killing Eve yet  You should watch it - you’ll love it. Yeah, you can download the lot on BBC iPlayer.” Fast forward one week ... ”Have you watched Killing Eve  I’m telling you – you’ve got to watch it ... you’ll love it. Watch Killing Eve.”The above passive-aggressive conversation or similar is being played out in offices, cafes and pubs across the country anytime two or more friends get together for a catch-up and a break from the daily grind.The problem is that as soon as you’ve watched the eight episodes of female psychopath drama Killing Eve as ordered, your telly tormentor will be onto the next ‘must see’ show.So, by the time you’re ready to have the Killing Eve conversation – they’ll be smugly telling anyone who’ll listen to watch the latest series of Inside No  on BBC – “it’s genius”.If none of this makes sense to you and you’re asking what Killing Eve is, don’t worry you’re fine. You fall into the category of ... perfectly normal human being and who might even spend time outdoors.If, however, you’re cancelling social engagements, gym appointments and the flu jab in the hope of getting ill, so as to make time for ‘box-setting’ then you’ve got a problem and are showing the first symptoms of a fledgling illness, let’s call it Netflix Anxiety Disorder .This obsession with television in the form of box sets is the new cool for those of us who care about such things.In my day, it was what music you were into and what trainers you wore to stand outside the chippy that mattered and woe betide anyone who turned up in the school playground wearing Adidas Kicks instead of Samba. The Face magazine was our bible and everyone dressed like a golfer on acid.: The most exciting TV dramas still to come this yearGo back to the s and it was the album under your arm that defined you – Roxy Music, Bowie or Steely Dan good, anything by The Wurzels bad.But now, the all-consuming television or ‘idiot box’ as it was once known is calling the shots and heaven forbid that you’re one of those relics who still watches terrestrial TV in chronological order – Bic Biro pen at the ready waiting to circle preferred programmes in the paper.At this point, I have to admit to I’m exhibiting the classic symptoms of NAD. I’ve found myself getting anxiousmy TV planner has less than  per cent capacity left for recording programmes. It’s the same feeling I get when running low on milk or sticking the last piece of bread in the toaster. I also worry that I’ve not got enough Maltesers in my chocolate stash to see me through a marathon box set sesh.To compound the problem, my planner is full of stuff I’ve taped – yes, I still say taped – but know I’ll never watch.This is made up of programmes I watched as a child and still feel nostalgic about – The World at War and the Rockford Files being two examples, although I reckon this is down to the theme tunes.: Dani Garavelli: Killing Eve heralds new lease of leThere’s also a fair chunk of pretentious stuff that I know I’ll never watch but I have taped in the faint hope it might improve me as a person.This includes the Art of France, Germany and Scandinavia, Jean-Luc Godard’s classic  French New Wave drama Vivre sa Vie, starring Anna Karina and the sublime  film noir Crime Wave, starring Sterling Hayden and Charles Bronson, directed by Andre De Toth. This was referenced by the great Stanley Kubrick in his film The Killing. I know all of this useless information because it comes up in blue every time I scroll through my TV planner to see what I’ve taped – before scrolling back to watch Ballers starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson. To my knowledge, Ballers hasn’t been referenced in any classic film noirs but it’s early days.Such is my TV planner anxiety, I’m thinking of putting a note in a will telling my we to delete the  episodes of the Rockford Files that I’ve taped in the event of my passing.The last thing I’d want is for a grieving widow to run out of TV planner space.Don’t get me wrong – I totally understand the benefits of being able to pause the telly while you nip to the loo or make a cup of tea.But there’s definitely a formula to these types of shows, an alchemy that draws us in and keeps us coming back series after series. I know it involves the unexpected death of a main character having learnt that from The Sopranos and The Wire but the rest is as yet a mystery.At this point, I have to ask, does anyone go the pictures anymore Could it be that we’re going through one of those dark periods for cinema, much like  years ago when television was king and movies took a backseat as picture houses started to close  If so, this is a shame.I cherish the memory of Friday,  October,  – the date Goodfellas had its UK cinema release. I remember that day like it was yesterday. I took a half day from my job as a Visual Display Unitoperator with Standard Le to head up to the Dominion  on my own to watch the Scorsese classic. I bought my box – it has to be a box of fruit gums – and sat through two hours  minutes of sheer unadulterated psychopathic joy. Just me and one other person in that tiny art deco theatre, watching Joe Pesci ask menacingly: “I’m funny how, I mean funny like a clown ” At the last count I’ve watched it  times ... it was on TCM again last week – and I’ve now added it to my TV planner.Oh, and just in case, Netflix Anxiety Disorder is not a real illness.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4830372.1542284835!/image/image.jpg","title":"defiant david mundell insists carpetbaggers won t force him to resign","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...In his first interview since reading the full draft withdrawal agreement on Tuesday night, David Mundell has given a strong defence of his decision to stay in the Cabinet - and twice dismissed ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab as a #carpetbagger#. The Scottish Secretary came under fresh pressure to resign after Mr Raab quit this morning over Theresa May’s draft withdrawal agreement, warning it would damage the union.: Calls for David Mundell to quit as he defends Theresa May’s Brexit deal Speaking to ITV Border’s Peter MacMahon, Mr Mundell said: “I’m not taking lessons on standing up for our United Kingdom from carpetbaggers.“Only a couple of years ago Dominic Raab was proposing to introduce a bill of rights into Scotland that would have overridden the Scottish legal system and devolution, so I’m not impressed by his latter-day commitment to the Union. I’m sure this is more about manoeuvring and leadership. I’m absolutely committed to the integrity of the United Kingdom. “I made clear at the cabinet yesterday that I needed to understand in greater detail the  pages of the Northern Ireland protocol and be satisfied that they didn’t indeed compromise the integrity of the United Kingdom, but I also take very seriously my job in ensuring that Scotland and the United Kingdom get the best possible Brexit that doesn’t also threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom and that’s what I’m still committed to doing.“I believe that the best way of keeping the United Kingdom together is to ensure that we have a deal as we leave the EU, that Brexit delivers for Scotland and the rest of the UK, and that’s what I’m focused on, not being part of some soap opera of resignations, and I’m not going to be bounced into resigning by carpetbaggers.”Mr Mundell said he backed the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement put before the cabinet on Wednesday despite widespread concern over provisions on Northern Ireland and fisheries. He had come under pressure from within the Scottish Conservative group at Westminster to quit, with the pro-Brexit MP Ross Thomson understood to have called on him to resign. : Brexit fallout LIVE: Theresa May faces turmoil as Ministers resign©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4830718.1542355564!/image/image.jpg","title":"sleep in the park named edinburgh s best cultural event","story":"A mass sleep-out in Princes Street Gardens which raised # million to tackle homelessness, and was backed by Sir Bob Geldof, Liam Gallagher, John Cleese, Deacon Blue and Frightened Rabbit, has been named Edinburgh#s best cultural event.More than  people brave sub-zero temperatures to take part in the first Sleep in the Park event last December, which was recognised in the country’s flagship tourism awards.The event, instigated by the social enterprise and sandwich shop chain Social Bite, will go forward to VisitScotland’s national Thistle Awards final after being recognised in the regional ceremony at the Prestonfield House Hotel.Social Bite founder Josh Littlejohn – who billed Sleep in the Park Scotland’s answer to Live Aid – will next month expand the event to Aberdeen, Glasgow and Dundee, as well as ato Princes Street Gardens.It is hoped , participants will sign up for the second Sleep in the Park, which will see Scottish singing stars Amy Macdonald and KT Tunstall flying around the country in a helicopter to perform in each city.Other acts lined up by Littlejohn and Sleep in the Park producers Unique Events for next month include Eddi Reader, Lulu, Kyle Falconer, Irvine Welsh, Kathryn Joseph and Withered Hand.The first event helped pay for  homes to be made available to homeless people and rough sleepers,  jobs being offered and  spare rooms being made available throughout the country. Social Bite has also opened Scotland’s first “homeless village” in Granton, in north Edinburgh, since last year’s event.The homeless village was developed on vacant land in Granton and is made up of  two-bedroom houses. The houses were built off-site before being erected in Granton ahead of the residents moving in this summer.Mr Littlejohn said: “To win this award for our debut Sleep in the Park fundraiser is an incredible achievement.“I’d like to extend a huge thank you to Unique Events for all of their hard work and dedication in executing such a memorable event. “Not only did Sleep in the Park bring together thousands of people for one single cause, but the money raised has allowed us to make signicant steps towards ending homelessness in this country.”Other winners at the ceremony included a city-wide tourism campaign to tell the history of Edinburgh in  objects, which was recognised with a working together for tourism award.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Friday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Armadale to Mallaig crossing is among the most popular ferry routes in Scotland according to new figures obtained by Kate Forbes MSP.According to  statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism.

A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

As part of the application the agent has included details of a study carried out to identy suitable existing town centre sites. “The study extended to both Carrickfergus and Larne and identied six alternative locations. These were assessed against a set criteria and discounted.“The existing buildings primarywas as Class B office use albeit ancillary to the main industrial use of the former Michelin factory. The site benefits from existing transport infrastructure and car parking facilities.”Mr McGuinness added that given “the lack of a Civic HQ” Mid and East Antrim Council have been highlighted as the “prospective end user”.He continued: “The existing industrial use of the Michelin site has ceased with a signicant loss of employment for the local economy. The reuse of this existing site would reintroduce employment to this site and potentially attract other businesses”.The Planning Officer concluded: “Given the fact that the proposed building is an existing office block and would therefore limit precedent the shortage of suitable office accommodation in Ballymena town centre the fact that Mid and East Antrim Council do not currently benefit from a Civic HQ and that by council locating facilities at Michelin may encourage further investment at this location, on balance, the proposed change of use is considered an acceptable other use,limited to a temporary period allowing it to be reconsidered in the future under the prevailing policy at that time.”He said the change of use shall be for a temporary period of six years, commencing from the date of approval.The Planning Department recommended that the committee approve the application.It was proposed by Councillor Audrey Wales and seconded by Alliance Councillor Robert Logan that members approve the recommendation. This was agreed with eight members voting in favour of the proposal.

I am leaving a small gt to the charities I care for in my will.Will to Give member the USPCA added its appreciation of the value of legacy gts with Brendan Mullan, Chief Executive, explaining:ldquoThe USPCA was established in  and since then the activities of the USPCA have evolved to meet the ever-changing needs of animals.By deciding to leave us a gt in your will you are helping us protect all animals across Northern Ireland.Legacies are extremely important to the USPCA and without these the charity would not be able to deliver our vital services to animals. We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our values.Will to Give added: Anyone can leave a gt in their will.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East. I mean, what’s the most exotic thing for a Westie  It’s’ getting on the Glider and heading East, seeing Stormont in real le,” he laughed. “The characters Gerard and I have created Jean and Joan, Tablets and Muttley and our two doormen Feargal and Maxi are all there as well. Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

He said: \"We have repeatedly warned that the backstop would come back to haunt us and unfortunately so it has.\"At the time, we wrote to the Prime Minister outlining our serious concerns about the implications of the text on the constitutional integrity of the UK and democratic decision making in Northern Ireland.\"The Government were hoodwinked by the EU, and the DUP bought the December agreement hook, line and sinker too.\"Instead of demanding and scrutinising meaningful legal advice regarding the potential implications of the backstop, the DUP and Arlene Foster instead chose to boast of commitments they had supposedly secured and ultimately welcomed the December agreement.\"Mrs Foster said that at the time, Northern Ireland will not be separated constitutionally, politically, economically or regulatory from the rest of the United Kingdom.\"Mr Nicholson claimed that the DUP had failed in their \"primary duty\", which was to protect the Union.He added: \"The Prime Minister now owes an explanation to the people of Northern Ireland why she has signed up to a deal which contains proposals that arent very dferent from the March version of the backstop which Mrs May said at the time no British Prime Minister could sign up to \"This draft Withdrawal Agreement makes for grim reading.\"But Mr Paisley rejected the UUP claims and said unionists did not want to see the parties clashing at this time.He said: \"Unionism in Northern Ireland should also stand united against a deal which is bad for Northern Ireland.\"Grassroots unionism does not want to see such a petty squabble when the real focus should be on the proposed Brexit deal.\"The DUP will work with those from all sides of the House of Commons and all parts of the UK to oppose a deal which weakens the Union.\"If the UUP is prepared to set their own petty agenda aside, they could play a constructive role in that process,\" Mr Paisley said.Meanwhile, Theresa Mays Brexit plan has failed to win the backing of the British public, with an opinion poll suggesting that more than four in  Britons oppose it.A YouGov poll conducted yesterday found twice as many people oppose it as support it, % to %."},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre inquest army campaigner has tweet reported","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

An opinion poll showed more than % distrust of Mrs May, a figure which spanned Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalists.Still, just as an earlier unionist leader, James Molyneaux, found to his cost with another Tory leader, Margaret Thatcher, in November , perfidious Albion works in deviously unpredictable ways.Ulster Says No was the unionist mantra then, but the question now is to what extent Ulster will say No in . The answer to that among unionists is far from as clear-cut as it was in .In the House of Commons yesterday, the DUPs Nigel Dodds delivered a menacing glare across the chamber in the Prime Ministers direction. He could point to the claims of her resigning ministers that the Brexit deal undermined the Union. He could warn her directly: \"The choice is now clear: stand up for the United Kingdom, or vote for a vassal state and the break-up of the Union.\"But beyond the bitter words of betrayal, where does that leave the DUP and the general unionist public back home  Whether the constitutional future is at stake, as unionist leaders and anti-deal Conservatives are claiming, there is no stomach for the level of protest which accompanied the Ulster Says No campaign three decades ago.Nor do the arguments for and against the current deal ide on simple constitutional lines, as evident from the Brexit referendum in , which showed % in favour of staying in the European Union. For the first time in the history of Northern Ireland, the leadership of unionism cannot claim to represent majority opinion on such a fundamental issue as the Brexit deal.It may be that the % Yes vote for staying in the EU is actually enhanced now by people who are relieved there will be noto a hard border, or who are actually pleased that, in future, Northern Ireland business and agriculture will have unique access to the UK and European markets.Certainly, on the evidence of statements and reports from the commercial community, the DUPs wrath at Westminster is not reflected in the broader mood of people, some of whom see new opportunity in Mrs Mays deal and are also influenced by envy expressed by the Scottish Nationalist leader, Nicola Sturgeon, who thinks Northern Ireland will have an unfair advantage.All of this may be immaterial, of course,Theresa May cannot survive the Conservative rebellion,her Government falls,a general election, or a new referendum, is called, orno deal can be brokered with Brussels. The imponderables are everywhere and no one has a clue how it will all end, not least the people of Northern Ireland.Our future is centre stage in the battle for power and influence, but we find ourselves watching the last act at Westminster from the wings. What we do know is that for all its pro-Brexit bluster, the DUP did not have the influence in London, or in Brussels, that its supporters may have believed it had.Just like James Molyneaux in  and Brian Faulkner in , Arlene Foster has been wrong-footed and misled into a  sense of political comfort by a Conservative Prime Minister. It is not asMrs Foster was not warned of this possibility, or that it could not have been foreseen.Meanwhile, in Dublin, there is subdued delight that virtually everything Leo Varadkar asked of Brussels and of this Brexit deal has been granted. For all the unionist criticism of Mr Varadkar, he has won a signicant victory in the Brexit negotiations and can even condescendingly ask the Dail to show understanding of the unionists dficulties.The Irish government has a huge advantage in Brussels and undoubtedly brought all its diplomatic pressure to bear on the negotiations. In contrast, hampered by no Assembly at Stormont and cut out of the UK negotiating team, the local politicians effectively sidelined themselves and the unionists, in particular, are now paying the price and trying to pick up the pieces belatedly.By aligning itself so trenchantly with the hardline Brexiteers at Westminster, it was always going to be dficult for the DUP to back a moderate deal to exit Europe, such as the one now on the table.Evennew regulatory checks had not been proposed for Northern Ireland, could the DUP have supported wholeheartedly Theresa Mays deal any more than Boris Johnson, or Jacob Rees-Mogg, or Nigel Farage  Hardly.Having shored up Mrs Mays premiership for so long, the DUP now finds itself in a Brexit no-mans land at Westminster: loved by the Brexiteers, unloved by Remainers, in danger of detachment from the mainstream of the Conservative Party and a long-standing critic of Jeremy Corbyn, a potential Prime Minister,Theresa May falls.How the DUP plays its cards in the coming days may determine not only the future of Mrs May and her Brexit deal, but also who remains a friend of unionism at Westminster and in Europe."},{"url":null,"title":"may says she wants all ministers to feel they can stay in their posts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Type  diabetes is treated by daily insulin doses – taken either by injections or via an insulin pump. It is also recommended to follow a healthy diet and take regular physical activity.Jillian Patchett, National Director of Diabetes UK Northern Ireland, welcomed the partnership with Click Energy which included funding for pilot programmes including a new role for Connections Ambassadors to provide help and support in diabetes clinics and also the  Diabetes Volunteer Inspire Awards.She added: “The theme of World Diabetes Day  is Family. We know how important it is to have a network of family, friends, colleagues, class mates and healthcare professionals who are all there for support when it’s needed. We really appreciate all the help we receive and encourage everyone to continue to raise funds and awareness about this serious condition.”ABOVE - Damian Wilson, MD of Click Energy and his son Harryhelping raise awareness for World Diabetes Day on Wednesday November th ."},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt security alert ends suspicious item declared hoax","story":"A security alert in Magherafelt has ended.Inspector Bownes said:  “A suspicious object found on the A Magherafelt bypass, between the Castledawson roundabout and the Aughrim Road, around :am this morning has been examined by ATO and declared a hoax.“The A Magherafelt bypass, which was closed for a time, has re-opened.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I want to thank the public for their patience while we worked to keep the community safe.“Our enquiries are continuing and I would appeal to anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the area recently, or anyone with any information, to contact police on the non-emergency number , quoting reference number  of   .”Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on    which is % anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."},{"url":null,"title":"nie called review deal customers residents street derry wait nine hours power restored","story":"Concerns have been raised after residents of a street in Derry waited nine hours to have power restored to their homes after an underground cable was damaged.The incident happened at the Paddock Lane area in Ballyarnett at pm on Friday, which resulted in a number of homes experiencing a power loss.However, concerns have now been raised that it took NIE nine hours to restore power, given that many of those who live in the area are elderly.Commenting, the independent councillor for the area, Warren Robinson, said that while he understands that certain circumstances could delay power being restored, he was nonetheless concerned at how the issue was handled by NIE.“I was made aware of the problem after being contacted by some residents who were affected. “Concerns were raised in particular because this area houses a large proportion of elderly residents. “I immediately contacted NIE and was informed that a third party contractor had damaged a cable in the area and was told that a repair team were on site but NIE could not give me an estimate for when the fault would be repaired.”Cllr Robinson added: “I understand that sometimes circumstances may mean there is a delay in having repairs carried out but electricity was off in this area for ten hours and my concern would be that elderly residents were left with no information and no offers of help from NIE.”“NIE do have a duty of care to these customers, I believe they have a particular duty of care to our elderly neighbours. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“NIE need to tell us why it took ten hours for the repair to be carried out.

The spokesperson continued: “We do endeavour to provide our customers with information where possible, however, it was dficult to provide an exact time for restoration on this occasion due to the unforeseen nature and complexity of the fault, as well as the safety required to undertake the repairs. “This was further compounded by our engineers operating in adverse weather conditions.

dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and donrsquot have to climb up to get them.Cararsquos infectious personality shone through in the programme as did her determinism to try out everything despite her stature.Her love of sweets are shown in

never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges.

eastern section of the U- league with an excellent ten-try victory over a game but outclassed Ballyclare side.Despite the torrential rain on Friday the pitches at Ballymacarn Park were in perfect order for running rugby and the boys did not disappoint.Despite missing three key forwards, the pack dominated the scrum and breakdown to supply a stream of quality ball for the backs to exploit.The line speed in defence was excellent after all the hard work in training under Brian McLaughlin during the week.Ballynahinch scored five tries in each half and Ballyclare had no answer to the pace ofCameron Lyons and Cameron Patterson in midfield and the power of Matthew Torney, Morgan Croskery and Shaun Lin up front.Lyons scored a hat-trick, while Patterson weighed in with a brace and Torney, Mark MacAleenan and Harry McCarroll were also on the scoresheet.Flanker Kai Shields made the most of his first start of the season, scoring twice during an eye-catching display in the back row.Front rower Logan Mallon put in his best sht of the season, dominating the scrums and showing excellent off-loading ability while fly half Dan Hewitt knocked over six conversions and led the line well in attack and defence.With seven replacements also getting game time, selection for this weekendrsquos top of the table clash at home to Malone could prove dficult.The U-s continue to show real promise and are progressing well with the quality of their Wednesday night sessions under Kyle McCall and Brian McLaughlin building real structure to their play.Their pride in keeping their line intact is particularly impressive and they have conceded just one try in the league this season.However, they will need to be at their best to get a result against Malone and all support will be greatly

help deliver best of both worlds brexit","story":"The author of a report, \"Brexit at the Border\", has said that the ldquopressure is on our political parties especially those with the influence of the DUPa \"best of both worlds\" brexit is to become a reality.Dr Katy Hayward, who is a Reader of Sociology at Queens and who has  years research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process, was responding to an article penned by DUP leader Arlene Foster in last weekrsquos Impartial Reporter.In that article Mrs Foster laid out what the ldquobest of both worlds would be for Northern Ireland, which included full access to UK single market, full access to the EU single market, and full access to future UK and EU trade deals.Mrs Foster said that no-one has offered this ldquobest of both worlds to Northern Ireland but Dr Hayward claims that it is possible but onlythe ldquoUK remains closely aligned to the EUrsquos single market andit stays in a customs union with the EU.Dr Hayward does not see a smooth path to any such scenario however.ldquoBut, as Mrs Foster is well aware, the most vocalMPs in the Tory party want the UK to have a far more remote relationship with the EU after Brexit. If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She too said the regulatory proposals for Northern Ireland were “threatening to break up our precious Union”.Shailesh Vara, a minister in the Northern Ireland Office, was the first to announce his resignation from the Cabinet this morning.Mr Vara said in his resignation letter that “the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom must be respected.”Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab announced his resignation on Twitter, saying: “Today, I have resigned as Brexit Secretary. I cannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU. Here is my letter to the PM explaining my reasons, and my enduring respect for her.”DUP MP Nigel Dodds, also writing on Twitter, said: “Thank you @EstherMcVey and others for standing up for the Union.”Dominic Raab becomes the second Brexit secretary to stand down, following David Davis’ resignation from the role in June.In the letter Mr Raab posted on Twitter, he wrote: “I regret to say that, following the Cabinet meeting yesterday on the Brexit deal, I must resign.I understand why you have chosen to pursue the deal with the EU on the terms proposed, and I respect the dferent views held in good faith by all of our colleagues.“For my part, I cannot support the proposed deal for two reasons. First, I believe the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland presents a very real trheat to the integrity of the United Kingdom.“Second, I cannot support an indefinite backstop arrangement, where the EU holds a veto over our ability to exit.

If we accept that, it will severely prejudice the second phase of negotiations against the UK.”He added: “Above all, I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manesto at the last elections. This is, at its heart, a matter of public trust.”The resignations came as European Council president Donald Tusk announced an extraordinary meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on November , at which the withdrawal agreement and a political declaration on future relations will be finalised and formalised.try catch     .               ..

That will cover a iety of dferent areas.“A lot of it will be around social le and social engagement - whenever players go out, how they conduct themselves and how they can protect themselves as well.”He continued: “It could be situations with the opposite sex, it could be situations where it’s with other iniduals who want to be antagonistic or want to start a fight.“A lot of material within the courses will be about behaviours but it will get into much wider topics as well.“This is about educating them in how to make good choices.“It would be remiss of any professional sport not to fully engage with as much support as they possibly could from outside sources around making correct decisions.”Referring to the rape trial, Mr Cunningham said: “Irrespective of what happened we knew that there would be reputational damage from it.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Oly-1.jpg","title":"titanic quarter office scheme out for tender","story":"Posted on Tuesday  November  by Ulster Business A huge office scheme for the Titanic Quarter has taken a step forward as the development is put out for tender.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
