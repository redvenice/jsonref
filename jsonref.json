Samba was then incorporated in 1917.   While the masquerade aspect of the carnival is derived from Italy, African culture also influenced the Rio Carnival costumes which are made of feathers, grass and bones.             Members of the Barroca Zona Zul pay tribute to the quilombola leader Teresa de Banguela during their performance on the opening night of Carnival              Dressed to the nines: One dancer cut a sleek figure in a plunging leopard print body suit (pictured left) while another adorned emerald green accessories and spectacular feathers (pictured right)         A dancer from the Tom Maior samba school performs on a float during a carnival parade in Sao Paulo, in the early hours of Saturday              Two performers from Barocca Zona Sul put on a mesmerising display in Sao Paolo, last night.

I\u0027ve had hormones and HRT and I\u0027ve grown to a Double D. Some women moan about me having spent £8,000 on my breasts. But these are all home-grown.\u0027As part of her new identity, Nicole also had to decide what she wanted to be called – something she discusses in the Starbucks online video campaign promoting inclusivity called What\u0027s Your Name?She explained: \u0027I decided to open a magazine at random and go with the first name I saw, because otherwise I couldn\u0027t start my treatment properly.\u0027The names Nicole Kidman, Nicole Richie and Nicole Scherzinger were all mentioned on the same page. The rest is history. Not everybody gets to choose their name. With transitioning, almost everything else is out of your hands, what with waiting-lists and the whole process.\u0027I was so chuffed that in the Starbucks campaign I get the opportunity to share a positive side.\u0027 Fully transitioned, she\u0027s modelled lingerie for the designer Sonata Rapalyte, done bridalwear shoots and taken to the catwalk in London Fashion Week.TV roles have included the 2015 domestic comedy series Catastrophe and Channel 5\u0027s Borderline in 2017, which featured transgender storylines.Last week, the DIVA awards, which celebrate the achievements of gay, bisexual and trans women, announced she had been shortlisted in the Actor of the Year category for her performance in the TV comedy drama Flack.Her public profile has allowed her to become a spokeswoman for gender politics – but this has inevitably put her at odds with activists with more extreme views.One of the most controversial demands of some in the transgender lobby is that people, even young children, should be able to self-identify as whatever gender they choose – and that the law and society should unquestioningly accept it.However, Nicole insists that people should have to demonstrate a commitment to their new chosen gender. She said: \u0027I knew at 14 that I should have been a girl. But that doesn\u0027t mean I was mentally OK to self-identify.\u0027Self-identifying is problematic which is why, to undergo surgery on the NHS, you have to go through so many assessments.\u0027I saw different psychologists. I had to wait a few years for my surgery. I\u0027ve never understood why someone goes to a clinic wearing male clothes and with a beard saying they want to be a woman.\u0027If you\u0027ve got a beard and your name is Dave and you\u0027ve just stuck a skirt on, I think everybody would appreciate that\u0027s not trans.         In 2013, Glenn underwent gender reassignment surgery on the NHS to remodel his male body as female\u0027That\u0027s not how it works. I\u0027m not saying you have to look like Cindy Crawford but, come on, make an effort.\u0027 Among the most heinous crimes, in the eyes of some extremist transgender activists, is the practice of \u0027dead-naming\u0027 – where a trans-person\u0027s birth name or gender are used instead of their chosen name or gender. Some even insist they should never be mentioned.But Nicole is not offended by such reminders that she was once a boy called Glenn.She said: \u0027I don\u0027t like to use the term \u0027dead-name\u0027. I don\u0027t like saying that because I didn\u0027t \u0027die\u0027 – instead, I feel more like I evolved. I\u0027d hate to think of myself before then as being dead and I\u0027m sure my parents would as well.\u0027She also explains why she hasn\u0027t undergone any facial feminisation surgery. \u0027I never wanted to not look like me. I wanted people to still recognise me because I wasn\u0027t a bad person. I was a nice person. I just happened to be born in the wrong body.\u0027Another debate sparked by the growing awareness of transgender issues is whether trans-women should be allowed to compete in women\u0027s sport.For Nicole, this is complicated –but in her own experience, gained while she was shooting a film about the superhero Wonder Woman, trans athletes don\u0027t always enjoy an advantage.\u0027There\u0027s an assumption that because I\u0027m trans, I will be naturally stronger than some other women. But I was the only trans woman cast as an Amazonian female warrior in Wonder Woman. I trained at Warner Bros for four weeks in preparation, and days before we were due to go to Italy to film, I was dropped because I wasn\u0027t strong enough.\u0027We had to be physically strong enough to act while swinging a sword around all day and I couldn\u0027t keep it up. I had transitioned from male to female but there were all these other women who were a lot fitter and stronger, even though I\u0027m broad-shouldered and quite Amazonian in appearance.\u0027So on one hand, I understand that if you are built like a brick outhouse, that would be an unfair advantage. But at the same time, my personal experience was that I had been through all of that and I wasn\u0027t as strong as these women.\u0027Aside from debating the roles of transgender women, Nicole is keen to stress how ordinary her life is.She is about to start work in a cafe, which will provide her flexibility to audition for modelling and acting assignments, and is in a \u0027normal\u0027 relationship. She said: \u0027I\u0027m dating, but not someone in particular.\u0027I\u0027m nearly 40, so I\u0027ve had a fair few relationships but I get bored quickly. I date in a very normal fashion.\u0027For example, I\u0027ve dated somebody that I met in a bar and somebody that I met in a supermarket. I\u0027ve dated someone that I\u0027ve met on Tinder. On Tinder, I\u0027ve always put in my bio that I\u0027ve transitioned, but I don\u0027t tick the trans box, though perhaps I should in support of the trans community.\u0027I just put \u0027woman\u0027.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Sanders strong showing Las Vegas caucus sites","story":"Your browser does not support iframes.Share this articleBernie Sanders projected to win Nevada caucuses | Fox News"},{"url":null,"title":"Ryanair boss Michael OLeary denies calling Muslim men face extra security checks airports","story":"Share this article \u0027This could be a Gerald Ratner moment for O\u0027Leary, where his flippant statements come back to seriously affect his business.\u0027His comments have also been slammed by a Labour MP for \u0027encouraging racism\u0027.          Mr O\u0027Leary added: \u0027You can\u0027t say stuff, because it\u0027s racism, but it will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion.

At first it was assumed he\u0027d had second thoughts. His motives might have been more hard-headed, however. For it emerged that, examining the painting under a microscope, the copyists had made an astonishing discovery: the artist had hidden not just a tiny self-portrait in the painting but, hanging on a leaf, a glass tumbler containing a dark heart, referring to Princess Margaret. She had sat for Annigoni after her break-up with Group Captain Peter Townsend, the man she had hoped, as a young woman, to marry.With such emotional detail, the portrait was suddenly considered more valuable than the pre-sale estimate. In 1993, Snowdon had married Serena, whose father, the Earl of Harrington is said to have a £250 million fortune. For all its high profile, his company has not been hugely profitable. Hit by the 2008 financial crisis, the Earl announced that he had taken a £400,000 loan from Sergei Pugachev, once known as the Kremlin\u0027s banker. But Pugachev left the company in 2011 and, accused of embezzling £655 million by the Russian government, fled to France.An \u0027angel\u0027 investor, British yacht broker Jamie Edmiston, ploughed £4 million into the company. Then, in 2014, he sold 51 per cent to Overture Investments Limited, involving Malaysian banker Nazir Razak, and David Chua of Hong Kong.Today, Overture\u0027s holding stands at 76 per cent. The latest Linley accounts filed in 2018 confirm that \u0027M Razak... is regarded by the directors as the ultimate controlling party\u0027. For how much longer this will be the case remains to be seen, as Razak has had to deal with the fall-out from his brother\u0027s actions – and is accused of facilitating an illegal payment from Najib.As Prime Minister, Najib had launched the Malaysian state investment fund known as 1MDB, saying it would strengthen the country\u0027s economy. But prosecutors now say he stole £3.5 billion to fund a lavish lifestyle with his wife Rosmah Mansor. According to US and Malaysian prosecutors, the money lined the pockets of a few powerful iniduals and was used to buy luxury real estate, a private jet, Van Gogh and Monet artworks.It has been alleged that the Malaysian funds were also improperly used to fund Leonardo DiCaprio\u0027s Oscar-nominated film The Wolf Of Wall Street, the plot of which is coincidentally based on fraud.Najib is facing corruption charges including criminal breach of trust, abuse of power and money laundering. He denies the allegations. In October, it emerged that the bank account of his brother Nazir had received £4.7 million (25.7 million RM) in 2013 from the fund. Nazir insists that he acted in good faith and has pledged to co-operate fully with the anti-corruption investigation. He says that he didn\u0027t spend a penny of the money he received and believed it was legitimately transferred for the purposes of political donations to help with his brother\u0027s 2013 election campaign.He has since taken voluntary leave of his position as chairman of CIMB, the Malaysian bank that held the money, but remains a director of David Linley Holdings and a visiting research fellow in transformational leadership at Oxford University\u0027s Blavatnik School of Government.Yesterday, he told The Mail on Sunday: \u0027When the alleged links between 1MDB and Najib\u0027s fund transfer surfaced in the media in April 2016, I took voluntary leave from my positions at CIMB in order for the boards of CIMB Group and CIMB Bank to conduct a full review of what transpired.\u0027They did so with the help of an accounting firm and a legal firm. I was subsequently cleared and invited back to the board.\u0027I have been a vocal and frequent critic of 1MDB, and the idea that the funds that flowed through the account may have originated from 1MDB has been gut wrenching for me. I intend to engage with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission to resolve this matter. I fully respect the work that they are doing to recover 1MDB funds, and will assist as best as I can.\u0027David Linley \u0026amp Co made no comment when approached.Nazir, a Chelsea fan who has been staying in Britain to pursue his work at Oxford University, recently travelled to Morocco for a family holiday.\u0027At last some sun!

In particular, they are interested in trees. Whereas humans are “obsessed with the whole body”, trees can loses limbs and still thrive. Then there’s tree sex, which involves the intervention of insects and birds. “Within the body of a tree,” says Farresin, “there is both death and aliveness.”Next month they open an exhibition at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, Cambio, for which the Serpentine’s artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, invited them to provide “more a way of thinking than an exhibition of products”. They have chosen to make the show about trees. It is about nothing but timber, and about everything to do with timber that you might imagine, from its molecular structure to its uses in everyday objects, to the laws and lore of forests. It takes in a genre of American portraiture that dwelt on the reflections of its sitters in their mahogany furniture, the intensity of the polish being a sign of wealth. It tells how indigenous people of the Amazonian basin use oral traditions to navigate the forest.At first glance, Farresin’s and Trimarchi’s CV is typical of many aspiring design practices. Founded 10 years ago, the studio has built a reputation among design cognoscenti through exquisite objects displayed at (for example) Design Miami, a high-end fair dedicated to the rarefication of domestic objects to the point where they become valuable artistic collectibles. They have designed promotional installations for Fendi and Lexus. Their creations look like exceptionally skilled and stylish works, of a kind that sometimes adorn the world of products – a light fitting, for example, made of little more than its elegantly-looped and carefully specified power cable.Closer acquaintance reveals Formafantasma (which roughly translates as “ghost form”) to be more like alchemists, for whom all forms of knowledge of the world are ripe for inquiry. The shelves of their studio are like a latterday version of a 17th-century Wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities, in which objects of art and science were promiscuously mixed. In Formafantasma’s version, vases made of shiny black lava cohabit with a light made of a cow’s bladder, with a bell jar containing a balsa model of some kind of tower. Formafantasma’s understanding of their materials is biochemical, technical, social, cultural, aesthetic, ecological, economic and geographic.Farresin, 39, the taller of the two, currently sporting a moustache, is from Vicenza, near Venice, the city of Andrea Palladio. Trimarchi, 36, trim-bearded, is from Taormina, the Sicilian city famous for its Roman ruins and scenic views of Etna. Partners in life as well as business, they met as undergraduates in Florence, where they learned from the 1960s-formed gurus who taught them that “you can have energy and joy in design, you can have fun”. They then applied to the Design Academy Eindhoven as a single entity, with a combined portfolio, to be accepted or refused as one. They were accepted and have worked in the Netherlands ever since: they like the country’s “culture of pushing boundaries” and the Dutch government’s support for young businesses. In design, they say, “it’s normal that the people who survive are wealthy”, which Farresin and Trimarchi are not.Their home is a mezzanine gallery, just big enough for a bed and a living area, looking on to their calm white studio in a former Amsterdam stove factory. It must be intense, to live and work in such proximity, all the time, but it suits them. “We have never done a project ided,” says Farresin, “it wouldn’t work. Conversations and words are our tools. We always know how we made a decision because we have always talked about it.”Farresin is the more talkative. Trimarchi describes himself as “more organising”, adding of Farresin: “He is, like, a mess.”“He’s a bit of a Nazi,” says Farresin, “he’s very, very precise.”“He could go on discussing ideas for months,” says Trimarchi, “I’m the one who says it’s time to stop thinking and to deliver.”You can see the difference between the two in the way they treat the peel of the clementines they are eating: Trimarchi piles his into a neat stack, the smallest pieces at the top Farresin is a tad more careless.Their collaboration results in pieces with a just-so degree of precision and delicacy that are the outcomes of intellectual research and speculation. Their objects carry a certain self-assurance, as if they were inevitable and reasonable outcomes of imaginative processes that might actually be irrational and strange. They deal in calm weirdness, in fantastical logics that ultimately derive more from observation of the world they see around them than from their own heads.They are always keen to expand beyond a narrow definition of a designer’s role, as someone who gives shape to objects. “It’s pretty boring to redesign a sofa,” they say, “since they have been made in the same way for ages.” They cite the custom of drinking coffee at work, which apparently was introduced by companies anxious to make their employees more alert and less tempted to drink alcohol. “This is an example of how everything can be designed,” says Farresin. They are concerned with the whole life of a product, from mine to landfill they oppose the planned obsolescence of, for example, iPhones.Their experiments with lava are a reaction to Mount Etna – “almost a cliche for tourists, where it seems like nothing can ever happen”. So they wanted to start an industry based on the material that can picked up from its slopes – “a mine with no mining”. They developed a collection of tiles made from volcanic ash, whose yellowish-brownish colours are the natural outcomes of the processes of making, not an aesthetic choice by the designers.They are reviving bois durci, a 19th-century forerunner of plastic, made with powdered wood, animal blood (to which they are seeking a vegetarian alternative) or albumen. “By looking into the past you can better understand the present,” says Farresin. “Everything was designed, which means everything can be reinvented.” A material, for them, is never something inert, to be bent to the designer’s will. It has a life, a history, a voice. They want, they say, to “let the material speak”.Their Serpentine show will, if it works, make it impossible for you ever to see a timber-derived object – a chair, a book, a violin, a bag of barbecue charcoal – in the same way again. It will explore the use of rare hardwoods in musical instruments, and demonstrate that common softwoods sound just as good. It will draw attention to the way forests are managed and mismanaged, to the trade in wood, to the science and politics of the international agreements that regulate it. It will show you that the things you can buy in shops are the outcome of a long trail of decisions and actions.There’s potential for pomposity here. Designers, as Trimarchi and Farresin put it, “produce future waste”. They typically grease the process whereby the public is induced to buy things that are newer, better, faster, more stylish or desirable than those of the very recent past, which, in all probability, will then be thrown away. There is a limit to their ability to buck the system of which they are part. Formafantasma are smart enough to know this: they don’t claim to save the world, “but if you are able to infuse your products with small ideas it can be brilliant, it can have an influence”. Which, with wit and grace, is what their designs do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ef35f2a4d80bd6f440f292a09a602df1bb58d14/0_345_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=788ac26995e131e41da270d2e18ac59d","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The displaced children of Idlib, the Coronavirus outbreak, Stormzy at the Brit Awards and Milan fashion week – the best photography from around the world in news, culture and sport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e85e4745bd92b5e899188e1a99e0a4121608810/145_2008_3769_2261/master/3769.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d771810af36ba3dc0d5e81fae26b0f2f 700w","title":"my favourite mantel by margaret atwood colm toibin anne enright and more","story":"From Wolf Hall to Beyond Black and Giving Up The Ghost, cultural figures pick their highlights from a remarkable careerMargaret AtwoodThe Tudors! Who can resist them? Gossip! Rumour! Scandal! Ruffs! Backstabbing! Madrigals! Farthingales! Witchcraft! Lace-on velvet sleeves! Cut-off body parts! More!We know the plot, or at least its bare outlines, but we seem compelled to relive it in books, films, plays, operas, and television series: and all the more so when viewed through the shrewd, calculating, vengeful, cautious, Machiavellian eyes of master game-player Thomas Cromwell, fixer and hitman to Henry VIII, as rendered in sumptuous, riveting detail by Hilary Mantel in Wolf Hall. If Cromwell had had a phone Mantel could hack, you’d scarcely be brought closer to the inner wheels and cogs of his bloody-minded and bloody-handed machinations.Bring Up the Bodies picks up from Wolf Hall. Things are not going well for Anne Boleyn, who has beguiled her way into the queendom over the cast-off though not yet dead body of Katherine of Aragon, but has failed to produce a male heir. Nor is she playing her cards adroitly: she’s too smart, too argumentative, too intent on influencing policy, too secretly Protestant, and too prone to miscarriages. It’s clear that Henry now wants to be rid of her, having spotted a more docile girl in Jane Seymour and once he’s made this wish explicit, Cromwell goes to work. It’s always a dicey job, being henchman to an absolutist tyrant, especially one who’s becoming increasingly paranoid and petulant. There was that fall from the horse and the concussion, and then the weeping sore on his leg: what exactly was wrong with Henry? Doctors are still pondering but whatever it was, it did not improve his temper.We’re the silent sharers of Cromwell’s deliberations as he weaves his way to his goal – the removal of Anne, and, not incidentally, payback for the courtiers who had humiliated his old master, Cardinal Wolsey – through secret dealing, blackmailing, hectoring, torturing, and the stage-managing of a bogus show trial worthy of Stalin. We know the story won’t end well for him – henchmen often capsize – but we watch with horror and admiration as he achieves his gruesome ends.Mantel’s triumph is to make us understand – and even like, in a grudging sort of way – this historically unattractive figure. Her meticulous research is lightly worn, unlike the carefully considered fabrics and textures of the courtiers, and her depiction of the many flawed human instruments on which Cromwell plays is sadly convincing.I await the forthcoming third volume, The Mirror \u0026amp the Light, with great anticipation. There’s an axe in it somewhere, I’m guessing. No spoilers though.Ben MilesI had heard that the Royal Shakespeare Company was going to dramatise Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies and so when, a few months down the line, I got a call asking if I’d like to play Thomas Cromwell I was excited and slightly daunted. That was the beginning of my journey with Cromwell, and also with Hilary Mantel, who I first met in the RSC rehearsal rooms. Having just read her books it really hit home what an incredible piece of work they are.Of course the stakes were high, but through it all we had the writer. Hilary became a great editor and adapter of her own work. We’d be rehearsing a scene that wouldn’t quite click and in 20 minutes she would rewrite it and it would work. If she said “leave that with me” she’d come back the next morning and there’d be a far better version of the scene which you could learn in an instant because it sounded so much like the characters you were playing.I loved inhabiting and reading the stories and it’s hard to pick a favourite. But I’ve just been reading the section where Ambassador Chapuys comes to dinner with Cromwell. There are fabulously intimate one-to-one moments in the room: you can hear the timber creaking in the chair, taste and smell the food being served by the cook - the eels, the apricots, the sauces – and then there’s the conversation, which is delicate, world changing, threatening, light, funny, horrific. It’s all there as these two great men discuss greater men than themselves. I often get transported into that room and feel if as if I’m simply transcribing what’s going on in a world in which I’ve been placed. These books are the most wonderful social and psychological studies.Colm TóibínIn the London of 1782, many spectres haunt the Giant O’Brien. These include his own failing health, and also the prospect of another, even larger giant following from Ireland to compete with him. The fact that he continues, painfully, to grow in size makes him melancholy, and the rumour of a performing pig that can count and read makes him wonder. Most chillingly, for the reader, there is a bodysnatching doctor who wishes, when the Giant’s demise occurs, to possess his bones in the name of science. In the meantime, O’Brien and his hangers-on get what income they can from putting on a peep-show: pay money and see a giant. All around them are men and women, many from Ireland, down on their luck, some of them almost starving. When they are not scrambling to survive, they sit around and drink and tell stories, O’Brien the most intelligent and best raconteur among them.The novel is written in darting, suggestive sentences the dialogue, in all its stoical tones and elements of good and bad humour, is like a chorus, or a commentary on life and its hardships. Using hints and clues, a deceptive indirection, Mantel allows us to enter the wounded spirit of her giant and the restless mind of the inquiring and ambitious doctor-cum-bodysnatcher. Their circling of each other is conducted with slow subtlety, but also with an unsparing sense of doom.The writing has a dark, sly wit. The Giant himself often becomes magnificently eloquent, his very height, it seems, giving rise to exalted thoughts and extended anecdotes. The novel feels guarded, intimate. Mantel has no interest here in panorama, or painting a large-scale portrait of late 18th-century London. Instead, the drama is between the characters their lives and their visions are, by necessity, circumscribed, which gives the texture of the novel an intensity. There are moments that dramatise the tension between Ireland and England, but that is just background. In the foreground are hunger and greed, and many types of distraction, not least the hope of money and a sense of abiding fatality and the arrival of other so-called freaks, including a woman who eats pins.Towards the end of the book, the Giant “has learned this lesson: anything you can imagine, can exist”. In her novel, Mantel conjures up this world in all its strangeness with astonishing single mindedness. Anything she imagines comes into complex life. The text gives you no clue about the author or her concerns, her own history or her opinions. Instead, Mantel’s gaze is directed outwards. Her imagination in this novel is neither mirror nor lamp, but rather a piercing ray of light that makes the layers of shadow in the scenes she creates all the more pronounced and beguiling.Sarah WatersIt’s hard to pick a favourite Mantel novel. Not just because they’re all so good, but also because each is so distinct. She is one of those inspiring authors who has been fabulously unafraid of pushing her writing into new physical and literary landscapes.The landscape evoked by Eight Months on Ghazzah Street (1988) is that of 1980s Jeddah. Thirtysomething Frances Shore arrives to join her architect husband, and finds herself part of an expat community that has been lured to the city by the promise of swollen salaries. It’s a stultifying world, gossipy and casually racist – a world of sticking it out till pay-day by hosting jolly little dinner parties, by brewing bootleg wine in the bathroom, stocking up on gold at the souk ... Mantel’s fiction bristles with “difficult” women, and this novel features one of the best: much of the mordant humour comes from the fatally bad fit between Frances and the ghastly fellow Brits with whom she is obliged to socialise, as well as from her furious run‑ins with the misogyny, hypocrisy and Kafkaesque obfuscations of everyday Saudi life.Because the Jeddah of Eight Months is a nightmare of a city. Glutted with wealth, throttled by censorship, it’s a place of secrets, fear and disorientation, a place where even the physical terrain seems to shift and baffle, as brash new buildings spring up almost overnight. Frances, a cartographer by trade, has lost her bearings. But is she also, we begin to wonder, losing her mind? Jobless, stuck at home all day, unable to take a stroll on streets where unveiled women face continual harassment, she begins to obsess about the supposedly empty flat upstairs. She hears footsteps and muted sobbing, she glimpses figures in the hall. Is the flat, as local rumour has it, the trysting-place for a pair of illicit Saudi lovers? Or is something much more sinister going on? One of the delights of this novel is the way it speaks to a thrilling tradition of “woman in peril” stories, the footsteps overhead evoking Patrick Hamilton’s Gas Light, the apartment building’s decor – a mass of hideous tiles, each resembling a single bloody-eyed face in a rictus of pain – recalling the jaundiced walls of the bedroom-prison in Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s The Yellow Wallpaper. Ultimately, however, as the disorientation expands, we realise that there are not just misogynies at work here: there are cultural myopias, competing models of freedom, competing versions of Islam.Or do we? I’ll be honest: I’ve read this book three times, and I’m still confused about what the hell’s going on. But that’s part of what takes me back to it. Creepy and claustrophobic, Eight Months on Ghazzah Street is a gothic masterpiece, and as with all great gothic texts, the reader has to forswear comfort, surrender confidence, become like Frances Shore herself – not sure, in fact. Not sure at all.Anne EnrightHilary Mantel sees things that other people do not see – and not just political undercurrents, secret ambitions or subtexts. In her memoir Giving Up the Ghost she is happy to discuss her experiences beyond the literal the fact that she has seen or sensed presences of one kind or another, including the ghost of her dead stepfather. This “flicker against the banister” is only one of the spirits mentioned on these pages there are also metaphorical demons and the devil incarnate, not to mention the ghostly forms of pennine sheep, by which she means real sheep, the kind that go “baa”.Mantel grew up in Hadfield, Derbyshire, a stony town so windswept she was 11 years old before she saw a real rose. Her family was part of a beached and declining Irish Catholic population of immigrant workers: her mother was a mill-girl, her grandmother did not have the luxury of knowing her own birthday. Mantel’s grandfather served in North Africa and her memory of him is thronged by the men who did not come home. At the age of four, she walked into school knowing how to load a machine-gun belt, and waiting for the moment she would become a boy. “My best days,” she writes of this moment, “were behind me.”The psychic rupture happens first in her parents’ marriage and then in herself with one piercing, childish thought: “I stop them from being happy.” She falls into repeated fevers, loses her thick hair, her robust about-to-be a boy body, and she turns into a child the local doctor calls “little Miss Neverwell”.At seven going on eight her (under-described) father yields his place in the marital bed to a man called Jack, and moves into his daughter’s bedroom. At around this time she sees in the back garden a nauseating “disturbance of the air”, a terrible absence that fills her with dread and then with itself, “a body inside my body, amphibian, budding and malign”. Not many writers could deliver this episode as fact, but to do otherwise, Mantel says would be to deny its phenomenological accuracy. This happened to her. It may be explained but not explained away.“This was the beginning of shame.” If you want to know why Mantel writes fiction, or indeed if you want to know why fiction is necessary, then the answers to both of these urgent questions can be found in Giving Up The Ghost.Sara CollinsIn the epigraph to her first published novel, Every Day Is Mother’s Day, Hilary Mantel quotes Pascal: “Two errors one, to take everything literally two, to take everything spiritually.” According to Mantel in an interview in 2009, this could well have been the epigraph for everything she’d ever written to that date. It would certainly have been an apt introduction to Beyond Black, her 2006 Orange-prize shortlisted novel, which aims to avoid both errors by intending very firmly to be taken both literally and spiritually. The result is a rare, almost hallucinatory reading pleasure.Actual ghosts circulate in the village halls where travelling medium Alison channels messages from the dead, striking only in their sheer banality: exhortations to get an eye exam, compliments on kitchen renovations. What feels like magic is carefully constructed by building up the minutiae of daily life (“A certain class of dead people was always talking about cardigans. The button off it, the pearl button …”). It’s what convinces the punters their dearly departed are really there, and it’s also how this novel pulls off the same trick: keeping the reader at once on the literal plane and the spiritual one.While the afterlife is mundane, the real world is re-cast as anarchic purgatory, with night closing in on its “perjured ministers and burnt out paedophiles …” Alison is also haunted by apparitions far more sinister than cardigan-hunting grannies, including her lecherous spirit guide Morris. Dark hints intrude, suggestions of a childhood in which he played some despicable part: a mother who prostituted her own under-aged daughter feral dogs with a taste for human flesh a disembodied head floating in the bath. This feels agonisingly literal, but we sense that Mantel intends these vulgar, rampaging demons to stand in also for dislodged fragments of memory, the novel reaching for metaphor to make its point, which is of course about the everyday world, not the spiritual one. We might, it suggests, be just as likely to find hell growing up in a rundown house in Aldershot as anywhere else.Yet even where its terrors are biblical in intensity they often also manage to be entertainingly absurd, marrying the ridiculous and the sublime, as when Princess Diana manifests, wearing her wedding dress. “Give my love to my boys!” she exclaims, and then: “Oh fuckerama! Whatever are they called?” It is an astonishing novel, with a spine-shivering gothic pulse. Part of the joy of rereading it, as with all of Mantel’s earlier work, lies in discovering the motifs that return again and again. Resurrecting Thomas Cromwell may have won her the Booker, twice, but Beyond Black is propelled by an awareness of text as a kind of transubstantiating material, a vehicle for bringing back the dead.Kate WilliamsA Place of Greater Safety, Mantel’s magum opus on the French Revolution, follows three young men from humble backgrounds, good lawyers, three times as intelligent as the men they serve. Maximilien Robespierre, Georges-Jacques Danton and Camille Desmoulins: provincial boys given a head start thanks to their preternatural intelligence, living in Paris, hauling themselves up through hard work, surrounded by a profligate and lazy aristocracy. They are, like everyone, at the mercy of whimsical, spendthrift monarchs, the king a “large, pious, conscientious boy”, the Queen wearing “diamonds like naked blades”, and a selfish aristocracy. Sound familiar? But, of course, unlike Thomas Cromwell, they don’t become the power behind the throne, they throw it all to the ground.Mantel has done her research, explored deep into the sources, as we know she always does. What the historical novel gives us beyond those facts is imaginative proximity. The historian cannot attribute motivation but the novelist must go deep into the head, find desire, faith, love and hatred – and in the characters of the French Revolution she does, to brilliant effect. Danton most of all is made real, a man of fear and hope, desire and equivocation. And she brings to life the ordinary people whom Marie Antoinette sees on her way to the scaffold, the glass-workers who down tools and stream out for revolution.The inner lives of women are often hidden from historians, but Mantel imagines them superbly. Most of all, Paris bursts from the page: the court, the exhausted milliners, the actors painting their faces every evening, the hard-drinking shoe-makers, the markets and factories and, as the city freezes and starves, “ships are impaled on the ice, with grain rotting in their holds”. These are the people who drove the revolution but are so often hidden from historians because they left so few traces. Mantel takes us into the ordinary houses and streets in which revolution was plotted, a new world was planned.

Thirty years ago it was the Irish. If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat.”His remarks were condemned as Islamophobic and threatening community relations, in a week in which a far-right terrorist killed nine people in Germany.The Muslim Council of Britain said: “This is the very definition of Islamophobia. Institutional discrimination against Muslims is well-established: whether it is the ability to get a job, buy a flat or even getting car insurance. The challenges of flying while Muslim are well documented across the globe.”Tell Mama, which monitors anti-Muslim incidents in the UK, criticised O’Leary for “being discriminatory and basing judgments on the looks of people, which is abhorrent”. It also warned that his “flippant” statements could come back to haunt him by putting off customers.In the interview, O’Leary described airport security as “utterly useless”, accusing politicians of trying to give the impression they were doing something to protect the public. He also took aim at the need for wheelchair-friendly facilities, mocked transgender people – “I’m male today and I’ll be female tomorrow” – and criticised Greta Thunberg.The aviation magnate, who has compared himself to Jesus, is no stranger to controversy, appearing to revel in his reputation for being outspoken. He has described environmentalists as “lying wankers” and said: “The best thing you can do with environmentalists is shoot them.” He has expressed similar disdain for travel agents, saying: “Take the fuckers out and shoot them. What have they done for passengers over the years?”Customers and staff have also been subjected to foul-mouth tirades. O’Leary called passengers who failed to print out boarding passes “stupid” and said they should “bugger off”. He ridiculed the idea that staff were a business’s most important asset, saying: “We all employ some lazy bastards who need a kick up the backside, but no one can bring themselves to admit it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c149601d1f7ddbe3786b83682e31409d21da01b5/0_322_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2154f891afcb48272443a9e8aa0806bf","title":"brexit deal fishing cornwall devon trade talks europe","story":"Fishing was a powerful factor in the case for leaving the EU. On the eve of crucial trade talks, the Observer finds optimism tempered by caution on the quays of Devon and CornwallNeil Watson was eight or nine when his dad took him out to sea for the first time. Soon he was earning his first pocket money by washing fish boxes on the quay at Brixham in south Devon. Three years after he started crewing, he got his skipper’s ticket and eventually he bought his own boat. For 30 years, he regularly spent seven days at sea followed by one night off, only stopping when his boat sank two years ago.“I fished through good times and bad times. Fishing’s like riding a wave – one minute you’re up the top, and the next you’re down in the trough,” he said. Now Watson works at Brixham’s fish market, one of the largest in England, where £40m of fish was sold last year across the UK and Europe. A fisherman’s life is brutal, he said, but he badly misses the camaraderie.Along the coast, in the picturesque Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey, Andrew Trevarton, a fisherman for 37 years, hasn’t been out to sea for two weeks because of atrocious weather. Nevertheless, Trevarton is feeling cautiously optimistic about the future. “You have to be an optimist to go fishing in the first place,” he said.In 2016, Trevarton and Watson voted for Brexit, along with the vast majority of UK fishermen. The image of rugged men in sea-slicked oilskins braving weather and waves to put food on the island nation’s plates was a powerful emotional factor in the case for leaving the EU. After decades of battling over Brussels-set quotas, which allow European fleets to take a lion’s share of fish from waters around the UK, the idea of taking back control was irresistible.Much, therefore, is riding on trade talks that are due to begin at the start of March. According to Nigel Farage, fishing will be the “acid test” of Brexit. Boris Johnson reinforced this view in a key speech on EU trade negotiations earlier this month. Any agreement must ensure that “British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats”, said the prime minister, who visited Brixham last summer to meet fishermen and sample hake and chips on the quayside.The timetable is extremely tight, with the EU saying that an agreement on fishing must be reached by the end of July, and the talks will be tough. A fishing deal is a precondition to a wider trade agreement, the EU has said – and some European politicians and officials have suggested that Britain’s access to the EU’s lucrative financial services markets could depend on EU fleets being allowed to continue to fish in UK waters on the same basis as now.At the heart of the talks are issues of access and quotas. Under the EU’s common fisheries policy (CFP), all member states have equal access to EU waters apart from the first 12 nautical miles from the coast. At the end of this year, the UK will become an independent coastal state, operating under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea rather than the CFP. As such, Britain will have control over an “exclusive economic zone” up to 200 nautical miles off its shores – some of the most bountiful seas in the world.Expectations among British fishermen are high, but history has taught them to be wary. In Mevagissey, memories of what happened in the 1970s when Ted Heath was negotiating the UK’s entry into the European common market are part of local folklore. “We were traded off, basically thrown to the wall, sacrificed for other sectors,” said Trevarton.Almost half a century later, they want redress. “We’re hoping politicians will recognise the great injustice done to the industry back then. We believe this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to put it right,” said Trevarton.He and Ingram were at pains to stress that they were not looking for European boats to be excluded from UK waters, pointing out that the UK fishing fleet doesn’t have the capacity to land the entire permitted quotas. But, they say, they want the cake ided up more fairly.Trevarton, who is chairman of the Mevagissey Fisherman’s Association, listed their objectives: control over UK waters, a greater quota share, priority for UK vessels in inshore waters, and a management structure combining industry representatives and scientific experts.Another point of contention is the EU’s demand that any deal negotiated between March and July is permanent. Britain wants annual talks.“An annual agreement allows you to be active and nimble,” said Jim Portus, of the South Western Fish Producers’ Organisation. “It can reflect the movement and biology of fish, the needs and aspirations of fishermen, and bend and sway with fisheries science. The CFP had enormous fault lines running through it, but it was only amendable after 10 years.” Norway had been negotiating annually with the EU for 40 years, he pointed out.Taking fish out of the sea is only part of the overall picture. About three-quarters of the seafood landed by UK fishermen is sold to EU countries – a trade reliant on being fast and frictionless. Brexit is likely to mean more customs delays and inspections – and if Britain restricts access to UK waters, the EU could impose tariffs on British exports. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French minister of Europe and foreign affairs, warned last week that if European boats were barred from UK waters, France would press for British trawlers to be prevented from selling their catches on the continent.Some British fishermen fear their militant French counterparts could simply take direct action to prevent fish landed in the UK being brought into French ports. Barrie Deas of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations (NFFO) said he fully expected blockades. “French fishermen have done it for much less. I would imagine there will be disruption.” There is a long history of fishing skirmishes, most recently between the UK and France over scallops in 2018. But, unlike the French, “we aren’t naturally a confrontational society,” said Trevarton.In an indication that such concerns are being taken seriously, it was reported this month that Britain has recently beefed up the Royal Navy’s Fisheries Protection Squadron with two extra ships, two aerial surveillance aircraft and 35 extra enforcement officers to police UK waters. A further 22 ships will be on standby.Some argue that the fishing industry has distorted perceptions by depicting itself as beleaguered and struggling – a strategy that has allowed it to punch above its weight. Chris Davies, a former Lib Dem MEP and chair of the European parliament’s fisheries committee, said there was a national myth of a “small fishing boat with a couple of guys on board, going out from a little Cornish harbour at dawn and returning at sunset”.Rather than focusing on who catches the fish, the key question was how many fish there are to be caught, Davies said. “The industry and the government should make the strongest commitment to sustainability. The last 10 years have been pretty good – stocks are stable and in some cases increasing. The most important thing is not to go back to the days of overfishing.”For the NFFO, fishing as a symbol of British sovereignty is welcome. “I don’t think fishing has ever been stronger politically,” said Deas. “The idea that past wrongs need to be righted is powerful. I think it would be extremely difficult for the government to come back from talks with fishing having been sold out again.”He added: “We may not know the full implications of Brexit for years, or decades. But by the end of 2020, we’ll know if fishing has a more positive future.”Nevertheless, any Brexit idend would not be enjoyed equally across the sector, he conceded. “It will vary by area, by fleet, by fishery. There will be winners, and there will be lesser winners.”On the quaysides of Devon and Cornwall, alongside hope there is a deep mistrust of politicians. At Brixham fish market last week, as boxes of sole, monkfish, plaice, brill and scallops were auctioned, loaded with ice and packed on to lorries, Neil Watson said the prime minister had “promised the earth” on his visit to the harbour last year. “I’m hoping Boris will be strong, but we know there could be a slap around the ear coming.”In Mevagissey, Andrew Trevarton was also worried about being “sold down the line again”. He said: “The biggest fear within our industry is that the government will buckle under EU pressure and maintain the status quo. I hope that anything that comes from negotiations will be an improvement on what we have now. After all, could it be any worse? But it means putting our faith in politicians to push this through, and that’s always risky.”The 70 registered fishing boats in Mevagissey’s harbour belonged to local family businesses, he said. “This place absolutely relies on a vibrant fishing industry. Our tourism is built on the back of fishing – people come to see a working harbour.”Mevagissey is unusual in the relatively high number of young men entering the industry. Trevarton, whose 30-year-old son is also a fisherman, said: “I want our industry to thrive, and our fishing stocks to be sustainable. My son has a long working life ahead of him. I want a future for him and the other young men of this village.”11,961The number of fishermen (and a few women) in the UK22,000People employed in fish processing and servicing the industry .£784mThe value of the sector to the UK economy: The value of financial services is £132bn(Based on data from 2018)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e1a9aee9760c0fefeb7883f19c590f924057cc/0_157_3340_2005/master/3340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad5020f91db2cf15e32e8135bff0d1c3","title":"charity does not begin at home for jeff bezos amazon","story":"Last year, Amazon gave $5m to homeless charities in Seattle. The city has the third largest homeless population in the US. So, who could argue with Amazon owner Jeff Bezos’s philanthropy? Well, the homeless of Seattle probably could.In 2018, the city council voted unanimously to introduce a $275-per-employee tax on large employers as a means of funding homelessness programmes. Amazon launched a ferocious public campaign against the tax. It also “paused” work on new offices and suggested it might move staff elsewhere. Four weeks after the tax started, it was scrapped. The tax would have raised £48m annually. So the price of a £5m donation was $43m lost for the homeless. And that’s just for the first year.It’s a story worth keeping in mind when thinking about Bezos’s latest philanthropic wheeze: $10bn “to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change”. That’s a month after Amazon threatened to sack employees who spoke out about the company’s climate crisis policies.How come Bezos has $10bn lying around to throw at climate change? Because, as journalist James Bloodworth observes in his book Hired, Amazon workers are thought to be among the worst treated of all low-paid staff. An investigation last year by Reveal and Atlantic magazines showed that the injury rate at Amazon’s US centres was more than twice as high as the industry average. It’s little different in Britain.So, if anyone is paying for Bezos’s philanthropy it’s Amazon’s workers, on whose backs he has become the richest man in the world. Rather than flaunting his philanthropy, Bezos might try providing decent wages and better conditions. Charity, they say, begins at home.

Yet just the previous week the government had tried to press ahead with deporting 50 men it described as guilty of “very serious offences” to Jamaica, despite the fact that many had grown up in Britain, had been convicted of drugs-related offences for which they had already served a prison sentence and have families in the UK.These are the Janus faces of the government’s immigration policy. Even as it continues to make Britain an inhumane place to live for low-skill immigrants, to demonstrate its tough credentials to voters at home, it talks up how liberal its immigration policy is to the international business community. Judged by the low bar of Theresa May’s immigration proposals, which proposed a minimum £30,000 salary threshold for longer-term visas in a post-Brexit immigration system, Johnson’s proposed system is marginally more open. Like May, he plans a system that scraps free movement and treats EU and non-EU immigrants alike. But the salary threshold will be dropped to £26,500 and for designated shortage occupations, it will be lower at £20,480.But there are major problems with the proposed system. One is purely administrative: the lack of capacity in the Home Office, a notoriously chaotic department, to introduce such a big change. The last such change took four years to implement. The government is planning for this new system to be operational in just seven months’ time.That is just the start. Many critical sectors of the economy, such as social care, have become reliant on low-paid workers from the EU. There is huge uncertainty about how this system will work for them most care workers, for example, do not come close to the minimum salary threshold. The government’s argument is that making it harder for low-paid sectors to rely on immigration will force up wages. This is crank economics. Social care is highly skilled work, and of course should be better paid. But it is underpaid not because of immigration, but because it relies on skills that are fundamentally undervalued by society. The government is indirectly the biggest employer of care workers and it is its lack of funding for social care that holds down wages.In making the case for overall levels of immigration to come down, Priti Patel, the home secretary, has argued that the 8.5 million “economically inactive” people aged 16-64 could do the jobs currently undertaken by immigrants. But the vast majority of these are retired, studying, full-time carers or sick. To take social care as an example again. Our ageing population means we will probably need an additional 800,000 more care workers in just 15 years. As the ratio of working-age adults to older people continues to decline, it would be very challenging to fill those vacancies without to some extent relying on immigrants. Those who argue that immigration acts to depress wages right across the economy buy into the fallacy that there are a fixed number of jobs. In fact, through spending their earnings, immigrants also create jobs. And working-age immigrants are net contributors to the exchequer: without immigration, taxes would have to go up to maintain current levels of healthcare and pension provision in an ageing society.The economics are indisputable, but there is a real danger in making the case for immigration solely in these terms. It risks real people being cast as commodities as assets to move here, contribute and leave. That belies the reality of how human lives play out. People who come to Britain to earn a livelihood contribute far more than pounds and pence: they enrich our collective cultural life. They put down roots: they make friends, fall in love, have children. None of that fits neatly into the 2.5-year segment of a working visa.Yet this government treats immigrants less and less like human beings. Its hostile environment policy has resulted in the wrongful deportation of members of the Windrush generation who have lived and paid taxes here for decades. Men who came to this country as young children, some of whom became ensnared by county lines gangs, have been deported to countries they do not know, where their lives are at risk from gangs, despite having British children and to all intents and purposes being British. The extortionate visa, citizenship and health charges levied by a profiteering Home Office mean young people who have grown up in Britain face thousands of pounds in fees and several years of navigating Kafkaesque bureaucracy in order to secure their status. The government’s right to rent policy – whereby landlords are forced to run checks on tenants’ immigration status if they suspect they do not have the right to be in the UK – has been ruled racially discriminatory by the high court.For all the government’s sales pitch about its liberal and open approach to immigration, the message once immigrants actually get here is clear. If you live and work in Britain, but are not British, do not try to become so. Do not put down roots, settle down, or integrate. You are not welcome here. Britain is not open, not while we have a government that fails to treat those immigrants who live among us and enrich us with the dignity and humanity that they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5a62744ab9e530e56cc222c72f11d9c350ed902/95_306_1915_1149/master/1915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5d0521ad2f7783c92c35be65bcff33d","title":"it is a little puzzling readers on early signs of spring","story":"We asked you to tell us about the early signs of spring near you. Here’s what some of you saidThere are beautiful signs of spring popping up in the grounds of the hospice where I work. It’s hard not to have mixed emotions: it is beautiful, especially bathed in bright winter sunshine, but knowing it’s only early February means we could just as quickly have deep snow next week. The life that’s appearing feels all the more fragile at this time of year and in turn it’s a reminder of the crisis our planet is facing.The photo of flowers above was taken this year on a ‘path of life’ at St Gemma’s hospice in Leeds on 6 February. The path is a place where anyone can come to reflect and remember. The wintry photo is from a similar time last year on 1 February when there was snow on the ground. Looking at the two they look like completely different seasons. In early February last year our gardening team were out clearing snow off the paths, whereas this year there’s barely been a hint of it. Natalie Clince, digital marketing manager, Leeds With the warmer weather our rhubarb is growing strong – which is a concern if we have frost later. Our rhubarb is organic and has been in the garden since we bought the house over 30 years ago. This year they seem to be appearing incredibly early. The daffodils are just coming up now too. I was in shock at how early they were and how beautiful and vibrant the colours are against the starkness of winter. Clare Howarth, 54, designer, from ManchesterSerra da Estrela is the highest mountain range in mainland Portugal, reaching 1,993 metres above the sea. Back in the late 80s and early 90s it was very common to see snow at this time of year. Lately it is rare a snowfall will last more than a couple of days, except at the top. It’s actually becoming more common to watch the fruit trees blossoming earlier. The above photo was taken on 5 February this year, a very warm day of about 20C, and shows an almond tree in bloom – something that usually happens in early March. The below photo was taken in February 2013 at the same location but showing the surroundings on a snowy day. Isabel Garcia, 35, PortugalMy partner and I are passionate hill walkers, hikers and in general outdoorsy people, so there’s plenty of room to compare. It’s been an incredibly warm winter this year and we’ve barely noticed the snowcaps on the hills in Lomond and Trossachs national park. Last year we were not able to take the road over the hills from Aberfoyle due to ice and snow today it was completely clear and not a sign of snow. We found these flowers during a walk in February this year around Loch Katrine, near the southern slopes of Primrose Hill. It’s a stark contrast compared to last winter here in Scotland when we went over snow of 10-15 centimetres for many kilometres – bloom was completely out of question. Martynas Virzintas, 39, hospitality manager, from Glasgow Spring is starting to burst out all over. The snowdrops have appeared and opened fully within a few days which is a little puzzling as they seem to have done so more rapidly than usual. Rather strangely, most of the flowers are coming out at the same time, even though they are normally staggered between late January through until April. Often the UK winter is persistently dull and grey – but not this year. David Seedhouse, author, Wolverly, West MidlandsI am chair of an environment scrutiny commission looking at ways we can reduce our carbon emissions in Southwark. I live in the middle of the city on the river and took the below photo in Southwark park, one of the oldest in London. I have noticed that spring is coming earlier and earlier each year. Snowdrops, prunus, narcissus and iris are not usually fully out but they are in full vigour right now. Blossom does make dreary places look beautiful and at the moment the scents of spring are greeting us before the end of winter. Leanne Werner, Labour councillor in Southwark, LondonMount Fuji is visible most days from the training ring where I work as a horse groom. Locals say that usually at this time of year the whole mountain is white. Last year there was more snow in January and February, whereas this year Fuji-san is only half covered in snow. You can see this from the photo I took on 3 January this year. Even though it was last year, when I arrived in Japan on 21 March, I noticed the sakura (cherry blossom) bloomed four days later when normally this doesn’t happen until April.

She stopped laughing. She stopped talking. And she stopped eating.”Ernman, a celebrated Swedish opera singer, and her husband Svante Thunberg, an actor, struggled to deal with their daughter’s silence and refusal to eat anything except tiny amounts of rice, avocado and gnocchi.She lost 10kg in two months and was on the verge of being admitted to hospital before turning a corner. Yet when Thunberg returned to school, her father realised she was being bullied. “The school isn’t sympathetic,” Ernman writes. “Their understanding of the situation is different. It’s Greta’s own fault, the school thinks.”After recovering some weight, Thunberg was assessed by psychiatrists and diagnosed with “high-functioning” autism, which Ernman describes as Asperger’s, as well as obsessive compulsive disorder.She went on to become attuned to the climate crisis, with the pivotal moment coming during a film shown in class about rubbish in the oceans, “an island of plastic” in the south Pacific. But after the lesson, while Thunberg was gripped with concern, other pupils enthused about a teacher’s trip to New York and flights to Thailand and Vietnam.“Greta can’t reconcile any of this with any of what she has just seen,” her mother writes. “She saw what the rest of us did not want to see. It was as if she could see our CO2 emissions with her naked eye.”In the summer of 2018, Thunberg began her first school strike, taking a homemade placard to stand outside the Swedish prime minister’s office.When she was joined by other activists, her father tried to persuade her to go home, aware of the emotional toll it was taking on her. But she refused and the time with other people had an unexpected effect on her.On the third day, a Greenpeace activist offered Greta some vegan Thai noodles. “She takes a little bite. And another. No one reacts to what’s happening. Why would they? … Greta keeps eating. Not just a few bites but almost the whole serving.”Thunberg is expected to come to the UK this week to take part in a youth protest in Bristol.Her presence at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate on Friday has been welcomed with delight by the organisers. “We are all just so excited – everyone is so excited about the thought of hearing her talk,” said Milly Sibson, who, like Thunberg, is 17. “I would love the chance to meet her because she is the founder of this movement and she is so important to it – she is an idol even though she is younger than me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2c7d4f5348e760f0b43305c1cf7b0c95ab57c4f/0_23_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f115a85b8b8ef40a76d018b39ce5644e 1320w","title":"bottega veneta daniel lee milan fashion week instagram","story":"Milan, Italy’s capital of cool, has laid claim to all manner of personalities over the decades: from the 19th-century author Alessandro Manzoni to the former prime minister and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi. But yesterday, in a frenzy of excitement culminating in a late-afternoon appointment at a former ice rink, the city swooned over a rather more unlikely target: the fashion world’s “boy wonder” from Bradford.Daniel Lee, who took over the 54-year-old luxury Italian brand in the summer of 2018, unveiled Bottega Veneta’s latest collection in front of a Milan fashion week audience which included musician Dev Hynes and Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver. The clothes had a sculptural feel, with wide sleeves on trenchcoats, fringing and sequin dresses, but there was a definite focus on items that, budget permitting, could be worn easily - suits, knitted dresses, flat boots and XXXL bags.Backstage, creative director Lee said the look was “about things that allow you to be very elegant and done up, but at the same time very comfortable.” Weaver, congratulating Lee, called it “spectacular”.Lee, who previously worked at Celine under the designer Phoebe Philo, has – like Philo – quickly created a zealous cult around his designs.What’s behind the Lee effect? The clothes have a mix of quiet 1990s-influenced minimalism and louche sex appeal that chimes with what luxury customers want after the brights and logos of streetwear. But Bottega Veneta, founded in 1966, has always focused on leather, and much of Lee’s success can be put down to a series of hit, waiting-list-worthy accessories that take this heritage and remix it.Hit designs include the sought-after Pouch (priced about £1,760), a ruched leather clutch partly based on a bag that Lauren Hutton carried in 1980’s American Gigolo mules (£570) and flat shoes using the brand’s plaited leather known as intrecciato and the Cassette bag, which blows up the intrecciato on a boxy shape. “It’s currently sold out in all colours,” says Elizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director of Net-A-Porter. “We can hardly keep any stock in and whenever we have an upload we sell out.” The pouch is the brand’s bestselling style ever.If Tomas Maier, the previous creative director, appealed to a traditional luxury customer, Lee’s Bottega Veneta has successfully cut through to his own millennial generation. This is partly through an awareness of the power of social media. All of his designs are photogenic – either worn or snapped alone. Speaking to The Business of Fashion website about the Pouch, Lee said “this bag had a tactile, soft, sensual, very photogenic aspect to it ... and obviously objects that photograph well work today when the internet is such an important tool.”Gabriel Waller, who sources sought-after designs for celebrity clients through her Instagram account @gabwallerdotcom, says Bottega Veneta is by far her most requested brand: “I have never witnessed or experienced this level of demand before.” She puts this down to the fact that designs are “instantly recognisable – we all know exactly what a Bottega Veneta design looks like if we are simply walking down the street.”“I love how fashion and social media combined can bring people together from all over the world,” says Rossi.Even those who might not follow fan accounts are seeing an effect of Lee’s designs on their wardrobe. Von der Goltz says other brands have the clutch now, and the square-toed mules are influencing “multiple footwear categories by multiple brands”.This is true beyond the luxury sector. Shoes at Topshop and Zara both have the feel of a Lee design. But will it continue? Rossi thinks so. “As long as they keep reworking the brand’s codes the way they have so far, I think there will always be something to be excited about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06e397e1ce2a2698618febd047d7a3357b0f17e5/0_0_4950_3280/master/4950.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e6e25d3d1eec28615bd287795ca2f8d0 1320w","title":"midnight family review documentary mexico city ambulance lorentzen","story":"There’s a twilight zone that the Ochoa family, the subjects of this superb observational documentary, inhabit. It’s a very dirty grey area situated somewhere between moral and amoral, occasionally dipping into outright immoral. The Ochoa men (and only once do we get a glimpse of one of the women of the family) save lives. Which, in any normal world, would make them the good guys. But the Ochoas live in Mexico City, in which there are just 45 government ambulances to support a population of around 9 million.Mopping up the overspill is an unofficial network of private ambulances, for-profit services that ferociously compete to pick up the victims of accidents and then charge them – or at least attempt to charge them – for emergency care. The Ochoas run one such ambulance Luke Lorentzen’s remarkable film rides along inside a vehicle that supports an extended family financially and provides a lifeline for the injured and sick. It also serves as a mobile childcare unit for the younger Ochoa boy, who prefers the outlaw thrill of prowling the streets at night to the grind of the school day. And who can blame him? Captured by a camera that frequently rattles against the sides of the hurtling ambulance, the Ochoas’ night-time escapades are electrifying and urgent, doused in strobing emergency lights and powered by adrenaline.As the film unfolds, however, it becomes clear that the Ochoas are in the business of what looks increasingly like extortion, albeit extortion wearing a caring face. With the cops strong-arming the family for bribes and the private hospitals paying out for each patient brought in, nobody comes out of the situation well.

And, as far as this lurid portrait is concerned, he has no redeeming features whatsoever. This may well be an entirely accurate appraisal of the man’s character, but it doesn’t make for a particularly nuanced piece of cinema.That said, the brash, gung-ho approach makes sense with the showy, win-at-all-costs personality of the man, with his veneered killer smile and casual cruelty. What is less successful is the film’s scattergun assault on other issues – I am not sure that the plight of Syrian refugees, for example, invites the same broad satirical slicing as the grasping head of a retail empire.Still, the film – an account of the run up to Sir Richard’s lavish, Gladiator-themed 60th birthday celebrations on the Greek island of Mykonos, spliced together with flashbacks and interviews (with a bumbling biographer played by David Mitchell) – is as rambunctiously entertaining as it is crude."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ea611bd90ed1364dcb91d190f4ea6ebf73791f/0_119_2566_1540/master/2566.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cb59e3259658a306010436bfce36d01","title":"erling braut haaland cartoon freshness borussia dortmund champions league","story":"Teenager’s goal for Borussia Dortmund against PSG was a perfect reminder that football is meant to be enjoyableIt can be difficult sometimes to remember why we ever started liking football. What was it that first stirred us back in our childhood to make sure we were always by a radio or television at twenty to five? That led us to pore over the details in the Sunday papers? That made us belt a ball endlessly against the garage wall and keep detailed records of the games of Subbuteo we played against ourselves? It’s hard to remember now. Was it the legal wrangling? Was it the appeals to the court of arbitration for sport? Was it the futile pixel-by-pixel examination of offside decisions? Was it even the thrill of seeing the rich and greedy hammer much poorer opposition and then demand to be even richer? Was it human-rights-abusing states pumping money into the game to make everybody forget about their wars and torture centres? It’s so hard now to remember.One noise was enough it bring it back, the noise of a ball struck with such incredible velocity that it whacked into the metal grating behind the net. It obviously would be unfair to place on Erling Braut Haaland the burden of being the only thing in modern football that is good and uplifting but that doesn’t mean it isn’t broadly true. In a jaded world when nothing is free from tribal sniping, he alone seems fresh and pure.Even those who insist Liverpool’s run of 103 points out of a possible 105 has somehow been fortuitous or the result of conspiracy surely haven’t found anything with which to denigrate Haaland yet. He’s 19. He’s played 462 minutes of Champions League football, 372 for them for an Austrian team, and yet this season he’s outscoring Barcelona in the competition.There’s something ridiculous about him, something so outlandish about his size and speed and power that the only appropriate response seems to be to laugh. No striker, perhaps, has operated so outside the bounds of what seems reasonable since Ronaldo, whose goal for Barcelona against Compostela in 1996 left Bobby Robson responding by clasping his head in disbelief and awe.Haaland doesn’t seem entirely real. At times he can seem like an adult playing against the under-14s: he’s 6ft 4in, quicker than anybody else and able to kick the ball harder. He’s like a cartoon, not only in appearance but in his capacity to command the narrative. Who has scored a hat‑trick on their Champions League debut and then, four months later, marked their debut for their new club by scoring a another hat-trick in the Bundesliga, in 18 minutes, after coming on as a second-half substitute?Other than Roy Race or Captain Tsubasa, who could respond to conceding an equaliser to Paris Saint-Germain, against the run of play, by, two minutes later, gathering the ball from Giovanni Reyna’s pass, switching it in full stride on to his left foot and unleashing that shot into the top corner from 20 yards? You could almost see the thought bubble: “Oh, for goodness’ sake, I’ll sort this out,” as he set off, almost see the whoosh‑lines on the page as he struck it. Even that noise, that chunk, seemed like something out of a comic book.There is still a rawness about him. Haaland’s touch is not entirely deft and perhaps his movement is not as refined as it could be, but at the moment that’s part of the joy of him. He will develop and he will, with experience, be adapted into more orthodox patterns, but for now he is something magnificently brash, on the pitch at least, a playground footballer with an uncomplicated shooting ability that recalls the greats of a previous era, a Jackie Milburn or a Bobby Charlton.The worry with a young player of that size is that they have been used to dominating through the age groups because of their physique, but Haaland was a late developer. Even at 15, there were many – including the former Oldham, Leeds and Bradford right‑back Gunnar Halle who worked with him in the Norway national setup – who thought he might not be big enough to make it. His growth came relatively late, which means he learned to play as an average-sized kid, and then as a gangling one he has a normal human consciousness operating within a superhuman frame.What made Tuesday all the more special was that the goal came for Borussia Dortmund, a club that, while far from perfect, have at least managed to retain their sense of connection with their fanbase, against Paris Saint‑Germain, the apogee of the self-regarding nouveaux riches, a side that change the colour of their kit on a marketing whim. One of their two star forwards has already been spoiled, a great talent erted by the unbearable pressure of being the most famous sportsperson in Brazil the other, after recent spats with his manager, is showing worrying signs of going the same way.Perhaps Haaland, too, will be tainted in time – the culture of football tends to the toxic and his agent is Mino Raiola, which does not exactly suggest a young man uninterested in money – but for now his worst trait appears to be his grumpiness with the media. Even that, in a world of image management and knowing celebrity, seems refreshing. Salzburg players have spoken of how on away trips, as they played cards or messed about, he would be reading articles on how to improve his diet or sleep.There is still with Haaland a love of football for the game itself, not for the trappings it might provide him, something that was seen in his celebration, running away before collapsing, Charlie George-style, as though overcome by what he had just done, a faint smile just beginning to tug at his lips before he was engulfed by teammates.This is what it was once about, before cynicism and greed, before leaked emails and overstated sponsorship deals, before sophisticated patterns of gegenpressing and frustration over frame rates. Haaland is a reminder that, at some level, football is still about the joy of absolutely wellying a ball to score a winning goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a788faa34ed9bfe7c32fb5c8de7acf94a855549/0_0_2262_1357/master/2262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3119764c70fd1f6d51f2326f6eb33e1d","title":"frank lampard chelsea red card var tottenham","story":"Frank Lampard was fiercely critical of VAR after Giovani Lo Celso escaped a red card for a stamp on César Azpilicueta. The Chelsea manager, who could revel in a 2-1 home victory, felt that the challenge had put his player at risk of injury and he was astonished that after the match referee, Michael Oliver, took no action, the VAR, David Coote, did likewise.It was reported by BT Sport that, after further reviews, Coote conceded he ought to have recommended a dismissal but that cut no ice with Lampard, who had watched the replays on a pitch‑side monitor. When Lo Celso was allowed to continue Lampard threw his hands into the air and made a stamping gesture, clearly indicating that he felt there was violence to the tackle.Because the incident was seen by an official who chose not to take action, the FA confirmed that Lo Celso will escape retrospective punishment despite the VAR’s volte‑face.The former Chelsea manager had said on Friday that he knew Lampard would play a formation with three centre-halves, raising a spying subplot. Lampard said he was serious about his belief that Mourinho had tapped into an old contact at the Chelsea training ground. “That’s the world we live in,” Lampard said. “I’m not being sinister about it. Whether someone has worked previously at the club, I think that that can happen. We’d been working on a back three for two or three days. I am not that trusting in all ways, in everybody, but that’s life.”Mourinho appeared to backtrack when he said Lampard always went to three central defenders in times of bad results. “No one leaked me anything,” Mourinho said. “They are loyal to him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3211cbcee2f557c96ec031d5c7ca214117ea9a9e/42_176_4729_2837/master/4729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69e86a7142b50f0fc44596c746fac03e","title":"liverpool finanacial fair play manchester city uefa","story":"In the days after Manchester City were found to have seriously breached Uefa’s financial fair play rules by overstating their sponsorships from Abu Dhabi companies, some of the ensuing discussion rapidly erted from that guilty finding to questioning the merits of FFP itself. Approved by Uefa in the 2009 season after years of wondering how to drag European football from overspending on players’ wages, FFP has since transformed top ision clubs’ finances overall, and was introduced by the Premier League in 2013.City’s impatient ambitions after the great fortune of the 2008 takeover by Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family were based on him bankrolling mega-spending, rather than the FFP principle that clubs should not spend more than they make in revenues and not rely on owner funding. Mansour’s executives were adversarially hostile to FFP and threatened to sue Uefa in 2014 as its club financial control body (CFCB) assessed City’s deficit at around €180m, far greater than the €45m allowable then.The idea has grown that FFP was specifically introduced after the big clubs lobbied to prevent Manchester City competing with them, based on the new Abu Dhabi fortunes. Senior people who were involved in developing the regulations reject that one recalled that discussions about incorporating financial discipline into Uefa’s licensing system continued for years and the detailed work began on creating FFP in 2008.City were in crisis then, at risk of becoming a classic illustration of the need for such rules. Their owner for a single season, the former prime minister of Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra, had backed heavy spending but was then accused of corruption in his homeland and had his assets frozen. City made a loss of £33m but Thaksin had no more money to fund it. That year, 13 clubs in the Premier League, the world’s richest, made losses, and six subsequently fell into some form of crisis after their owners decided they could no longer keep pouring the money in.Mansour’s purchase was a startling reversal of City’s luck over the previous 30 years – apart from inheriting the City of Manchester stadium after the 2002 Commonwealth Games. City could have fallen like Portsmouth, or Leeds, or Bolton, then in the Premier League, who finally went into administration last year after their owner, Eddie Davies, called a halt after writing off £180m, or Málaga, the Spanish club whose crisis was cited by Uefa when FFP was finally introduced.The then Uefa president, Michel Platini, had talked about debt being the issue, but as accountants worked on the principles, they formed the view that debt can be taken on for investment purposes, but losses, overspending, was the key problem driving clubs into trouble.Platini and his officials notably said at the time that they were not aiming to stifle investment in football but to encourage it for long‑term development. Owners’ money could not count to reduce allowable losses if it was just paying excessive wages but they could make unlimited investment in stadium improvements, youth development and other infrastructure.Uefa can point to Liverpool’s recovery since then as an example of the system working as they hoped. In 2009-10, Liverpool were falling into financial crisis under the debt‑loading ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett they finished seventh in the Premier League, made a loss of £20m and owed the Royal Bank of Scotland £200m.When crisis bit and RBS in effect took control of the failing club, John W Henry ultimately bid and fought the court battle to buy the club partly because he believed FFP made it a viable prospect. A private equity investor and owner of the Boston Red Sox, Henry believed from his business experience that if unlimited spending on players backed by owner funding were allowed, nobody could compete with a Gulf state. However, the FFP framework restricting losses meant that his FSG ownership could plan for rebuilding Liverpool through its revenues.In almost 10 years since his FSG takeover, they have not put money in to bankroll player signings, but have advanced a £110m interest-free loan to build the new main stand, ending years of Anfield stadium stagnation. Revenues have grown steadily as the recruitment of players and, transformationally, Jürgen Klopp as manager have improved the team’s performances.Liverpool were always a big club and similar growth would not produce a Champions League victory and impending Premier League title for many others. The issue of “competitive balance” is real, as success is consolidated in a few rich clubs, but that was not the problem FFP was designed to solve. The richest clubs were carrying off the trophies before, as they do, but unlimited spending was no rational model for football competition, because a club needed a Gulf state backer, as City and the Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain had, or a Russian oligarch as Chelsea had, to fund the necessary wage bill.In 2017, after six years of FFP, clubs across Europe’s top isions recorded an overall profit for the first time, €615m, finally reversing years of losses. Premier League clubs were also transformed into profit immediately FFP was introduced in 2013, although City and a small group of other clubs had voted against it.City got through their initial years of massive losses by agreeing a settlement with Uefa in 2014, involving relatively modest restraints. Making agreements with Uefa to enable large initial investment is now built into the FFP system. City are now looking to build a global football empire and not share more money to facilitate competitive balance: they led the campaign by the Premier League’s “big six” in 2018 to have more of the international TV rights than the other 14.Contrary to some of the fury expressed this past week, City have not been found guilty of breaching FFP rules by exceeding permitted loss limits. The finding, which City are appealing against, is that they overstated their Abu Dhabi sponsorships in their accounts and in their submissions to Uefa, a different issue entirely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7be2e79ee86ae2ffe866327f4fb635aeb0205e/338_454_5278_3167/master/5278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b19c9154b08e02eb0b06566986151afa","title":"tell us have you moved across europe for love","story":"If you have moved across Europe to pursue romance we would like to hear from you.

Before moving into her flat last June, she sold all of the art on her gallery wall to fund the purchase of this new print. Three of Daley-Clarke’s grandparents took a similar journey from the West Indies in the early 1960s: it’s a journey she is reminded of every time she sees the print, and an image she hopes her daughters will remember growing up with.Daley-Clarke, 29, lives with her husband, Jermel, 33, and two young daughters – Israel, 4, and Ezra, 2 – in a social housing flat in Islington, north London. The street they live on comprises mostly detached Victorian villas. The property they live in has been split into three apartments. Here, on the first floor, in a two-bedroom flat with a front room, kitchen, bathroom and small balcony, Daley-Carke has created what she describes as a “natural, nourishing home” for her young family. “I never want my family to go without because we can’t afford to live in a bigger home,” she says. “But really, we don’t need any more.”Through her social media channel, @thevitamindproject, she talks openly about home ownership and the stigma of living in social housing. “When I was growing up, I genuinely didn’t know that people rented privately,” she recalls. “I thought you either owned your home or you lived in social housing.” It wasn’t until her early 20s that she realised the opposite was also true: friends and colleagues who rented privately had very little understanding of social housing.“There is nothing to prevent anyone from applying for social housing,” she says, before going on to explain the “very fair” points-based system housing associations use to allocate properties. The rent – which is non-subsidised and non-profit – is pegged to local salaries and their tenancy is secure for five years. “All of that is rarely talked about,” says Daley-Clarke, “and I think that is where the stigma comes from – from not understanding that not everyone has the same start in life, and from not understanding that privilege comes in so many different shapes and forms.”According to a 2019 report by the English Housing Survey, the nationwide shortage of social housing has lead to the highest levels of overcrowding since records began 24 years ago. Daley-Clarke recalls her own experience of leaving home at 16 and living in temporary accommodation for seven years before her name eventually made its way to the top of the waiting list. Her first rented home was a one-bedroom flat in King’s Cross. While living there she met her husband and started a family. It was another three years before a two-bedroom property became available.When the call finally came to view their current flat, Daley-Clarke agreed to the tenancy on the spot, knowing it could be another three years before the next two-bedroom property became available.“It was in such a bad state of disrepair that six other families had already turned it down,” she recalls. While the housing association has a duty to ensure its properties are safe, anything deemed cosmetic is left to the tenants.The home Daley-Clarke has created bears little resemblance to the flat she first saw last June. Earthy tones, second-hand furniture, natural fabrics and abundant plant life fill the space with warmth and character. Daley-Clarke manages an interior design showroom: her eye for design is apparent throughout.Having moved in, the couple prioritised the girls’ bedroom. They painted the walls white and set up a second-hand Ikea bed and cot, draping the frame in natural fabrics in shades of turmeric, terracotta and grey. Their toys (mostly wooden, mostly second-hand) are corralled in easy-to-reach baskets and drawers and their books are displayed in an alcove created by removing the bedroom door, freeing up the dead space behind.By week three, they had also decorated the main living and dining area, filling it with plants and furniture from their previous flat. (The only new additions are the gigantic banana plant and dining table.) The hallway has been papered in a busy bamboo print that reminded Daley-Clarke of the set in Only Fools and Horses. The master bedroom is still a work in progress.The couple invested two-years’ of savings in the renovation of the bathroom and kitchen, both of which were dilapidated, cold and clinical. The work was undertaken concurrently in just 10 days. “If you’re living in the space at the same time with two small children, you’ve got to do it quickly,” says Daley-Clarke. In the kitchen, Jermel built the work surface and open shelving from reclaimed scaffolding boards. The bathroom has been turned into a cosseting, tactile space with irregular teal tiles and a patterned terracotta floor that wraps over the side of the bath, creating the illusion of a built-in tub.For Daley-Clarke and her family, their home is a safe place for memories to be made and savoured. “Paying fair, affordable rent has given us the freedom to plan financially,” she says. “It’s enabled us to both work full-time and support our family without relying on housing benefits. It’s given us breathing space.”Contact your council If you are planning to do any structural work on a social housing property, it will need to be pre-approved by your council or housing association. Social housing tenants are subject to yearly inspections and must provide safety certificates for any structural works carried out.Buying for the future When buying furniture or appliances, make sure you buy with intention. Save up and buy the best you can afford, not the first thing you see.Space-saving solutions We have hardly any floor space in our kitchen, but we also have beautiful 3m-high ceilings, so we’ve stacked our open shelving high to maximise storage. We’ve also maximised floorspace in the living room by fixing two shelving systems to the wall and using a row of vintage theatre seats in place of a second sofa. They fold up when not in use, which frees up more precious floor space."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b3c1d21b8aa4b8f287e2132bd8dc3aee81a76b/616_1277_6038_3624/master/6038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77f30bdd6180d86042027887de8aafaa","title":"this much i know don letts punk music dj windrush","story":"The DJ and musician, 64, on being black and British, finding a scene, and why punk’s not deadJamaican people love country and western. My first musical memory is sitting at home with my dad, listening to incarnations of what would become reggae on his sound system. But as well as Prince Buster, and Toots and the Maytals, my dad loved things like Welcome to My World by Jim Reeves. It was the storytelling he could relate to.I know the exact moment I wanted music to be my life. I was 14 or 15, it was 1971, and I was watching the Who at the Young Vic in London. I went after school, in my uniform, and I could see the whites of Keith Moon’s eyes and Pete Townshend windmilling and that was it. I didn’t know what it was. But it opened a door that I wanted to step through.My parents got a rough deal. They are the Windrush Generation, and there was a feeling among them that the way they would get on once they’d arrived in Britain was by Anglicising themselves. Obviously, that was a terrible idea, and when my generation arrived we reacted against that. But I’ll say this about my parents. Any fun they had stopped in their 20s. It was all about bringing the kids up right. My generation is much more selfish.The Windrush deportations are a disgrace. My parents were asked to come to this country to help rebuild it after the Second World War. They weren’t welcomed warmly, but they held it down. They drove the buses and worked the NHS. It wasn’t their generation that rioted. It was mine. It is the biggest of slaps across the face.Being British and black was a confusing concept for a long time. The point of conflict with my parents was when I went out with my dreadlocks. To me, wearing my dreads was me connecting with my heritage, the same heritage my parents had repressed in order to fit in. I was trying to find my scene, and the messages coming out of that Rastafarian world were much more interesting than what I was being taught at school. To be honest, I don’t think it was until the late 80s and stuff like Soul 2 II Soul that black Britain really found its feet. That’s the first time, really, I think we found our thing.My career was a let down to my parents. They’d busted their arses for their kid to go to a grammar school – and to see it from their perspective, the arts were not a way for black people to survive. They came around when they saw me on the bloody telly, mind!Punk was a refuge from racism. On the streets, young men like me were constantly getting pulled up by the cops. The far right were getting stronger throughout the 70s. But punk shows were bringing people together. The Clash were doing Rock Against Racism concerts. The Slits were doing gigs with Aswad. We were all cheering each other on. No racism in our bubble.Punk didn’t start and end in the 70s. It’s a constant spirit. An attitude. A living thing. It’s Woody Guthrie and Sun Ra. It’s just that the British did that colonial thing and put a Union Jack all over it, so it feels like a moment trapped in time. Enoch Powell did such harm to this country. When he did his Rivers of Blood speech in 1968 everything changed. I went from being “Lettsy” in the playground to “that black bastard” and “golliwog” overnight. And, thanks to Brexit, it’s happening again. It’s absolutely heartbreaking.

Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike was involved in a collision with a car outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August 2019. Sacoolas, 42, the wife of an intelligence official based at the US military base, claimed diplomatic immunity and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international controversy. The US refused an extradition request for Sacoolas last month. Dunn’s family has asked the foreign affairs secretary, Dominic Raab, to halt the extradition process for Assange before the beginning of the first full court hearing on Monday. The Mail on Sunday quoted Radd Seiger, the Dunn family’s spokesman: “Despite its disgraceful refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the US continues to seek the extradition of people in the UK – such as Julian Assange. In doing so, they are demonstrating an extraordinary amount of hypocrisy. “As Dominic Raab told us when we met with him on January 27: ‘We are reviewing all options.’ We want him now to exercise the option of not extraditing Julian Assange to the US.” Assange, 48, is being held in Belmarsh prison, in south-east London, and is wanted in the US to face 18 charges over the publication of US cables a decade ago. If found guilty he could face a 175-year sentence. Dunn’s family has previously called for the Duke of York to cooperate with law enforcement in the US amid allegations around his friendship with the billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. At a press conference earlier this month, Seiger joined a lawyer for alleged victims of Epstein to call for both Sacoolas to return to the UK and Prince Andrew to face questioning from the FBI in the US. Allegations about Andrew surfaced from Virginia Giuffre, who claimed she was trafficked by Epstein and alleged the duke slept with her on three occasions, including when she was 17 – still a minor under US law. Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b535dd73cfc924856aaf543a663a0f0e519eca2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba0213230d2f375886508c008cc40722","title":"keir starmer labour leadership blame each other or pull together","story":"The frontrunner in the Labour leadership race sets out his stall in a wide-ranging interview as the ballots go out to party membersWaiting for the train to Manchester on the latest leg of his Labour leadership campaign, Keir Starmer is approached by a well-wisher seeking a selfie. He makes small talk about football as the photo is taken. In Manchester, he visits his phone bank team, thanks them with a smile and makes a gentle joke about the competition to win votes, praising their polite approach to party members. At that evening’s hustings, he avoids any newsworthy interventions – save a crowd-pleasing criticism of the media over its coverage of transgender issues.These small exchanges reflect the qualities and calculations that have seen Starmer emerge as the clear frontrunner in a race which has largely failed to capture the public’s attention. His quiet competence, seriousness and determination not to rock the boat seem to be winning the day.Yet this approach has left huge unanswered questions about where Starmer’s politics are rooted – and what he would do with the party should he be announced as Jeremy Corbyn’s replacement on 4 April. It is a mystery the Observer is keen to address. In his own words, how would he describe his politics?“Let me just deal with what it is that the leader of the Labour party, whoever it is, has got to do in the next few years,” he begins, not attempting to disguise the fact he is answering his own question.“There are three very clear priorities. The first is uniting the party. We have to have a leader who is capable of bringing people together. We’ve got 580,000 members, we’re the biggest political party in Europe – and we spend most of the time taking lumps out of each other.“The second is to be the most effective opposition against Boris Johnson. The focus in this campaign now really has to be on him. He’s a dangerous man. We all love the caricature, but actually he’s a really dangerous man.“Then we’ve got to forge our way towards actually winning the next general election, because if we lose the next general election, the Labour party – our party – will have been out of power for longer than any period since the second world war.”In the debate around his personal politics, which has seen some on the left warn he is no believer in the Corbynite cause, he settles on tackling inequality. “I’ve been clear that if we are to deal with the gross inequality we now have in our society, we’re going to have to do some radical things as an incoming Labour government, with a fundamental shift in wealth, resource and opportunity.” He doesn’t want to be drawn on anything that might identify him too closely with any faction. “People are forever trying to badge me with reference to some historic figure. I’ve resisted that because it’s what I think about the future that matters.”With members able to cast their votes from tomorrow, Starmer is determined to point them towards his priorities: unity, opposing Johnson and building a credible election bid. They are his strengths in comparison to rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey, the left’s favourite, and Lisa Nandy, the outsider who has performed strongly at hustings.Given the huge isions within Labour, is his plea for unity remotely realistic? “You have to give the party something to fight for,” he says. “I genuinely think, and I’m conscious that sometimes you see what you want to see, that our members are yearning to turn a page now. At the hustings, at the members’ meetings we’ve had, there hasn’t been some of the ision we’ve seen in recent years in the Labour party.”It’s a pleasant fiction from Starmer, quickly dispelled by events. That evening at the LGBT+ Labour leadership hustings, Nandy is interrupted by a heckler demanding to know why she signed a controversial pledge on trans rights. The heckler is told “you don’t belong here” by another audience member. Heckling culminates in a cry of “fuck off” before someone is led out, complaining lesbian rights were being ignored. Meanwhile, in the past few weeks, some have contrived to have an argument about whether New Labour was “Thatcherite”.So, in the name of unity, will Starmer take any practical measures to improve the atmosphere and reduce hostility in the party? “I’m not interested in purging anybody out of the Labour party. On some key issues, antisemitism being one of them, we do have to be clear and we do now have to be robust. If you’re antisemitic, you shouldn’t be in the Labour party.”As frustrating as Starmer’s caution over upsetting the membership is, in purely strategic terms it is the obvious strategy for a frontrunner. And while there are stock phrases he falls back on (“no victory without values” is a favourite), he is no Theresa May, whose robotic responses and inability to think on her feet came to define her. With Starmer, there is a sense that he is setting his own parameters and making cold, lawyerly calculations about how far he can go in criticising the past regime and pointing towards a different course.In fact, Starmer is keen to tweak the dials of his election pitch. He presents a challenge to the membership. “They’ve got a choice – we as a party can mope around, head in hands, arguing with each other, pointing fingers about who’s to blame for this that and the other,” he says. “Or we could decide the next four years of our history is for us – we can pull together and shape what happens next, and if we take our party from where it is now to a position where it can win an election, that will change history.“This is a choice we’ve got to make – a conscious choice for half a million members. Do you want to make history, pull together and change? If the answer to that is yes, then let’s do it. Because if not, we’re going to lose the next election.” And he wants to make the fight against Johnson more personal. “We need to train our focus on Boris Johnson and attack him, not each other. We caricature him as a clown. He’s not a clown, he’s dangerous. What he’s doing is dangerous and will damage our country.”So did Labour underestimate Johnson? Suddenly, Starmer finds himself at the limits of his comfort in criticising the Corbyn regime. There is a long pause and words emerge slowly, syllable by syllable. “I think that we need to be absolutely clear about how dangerous he is and how ruthless he is and we have to be exposing him relentlessly, and I’m not sure we did that as well as we should have done.”Starmer’s adoption of huge parts of Corbyn’s policy programme, including abolishing tuition fees and increasing public ownership, has led some to wonder if he is prepared to make any changes to a party that crashed to a disastrous election. He has said Labour should not “oversteer” from the Corbyn era, but will there be any steering involved at all?“There’s a tendency in any party, in any organisation, when something goes wrong, to say we must have got it completely wrong. I’ve seen this in other organisations. Something goes wrong and everyone effectively moves to the other side of the room.“We have to remember and respect the fact that Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell made it very clear that the Labour party is anti-austerity, the Labour party is against cuts to public services, the Labour party believes in common ownership and the Labour party believes in the green new deal. These are really important steps.”That’s what he wants to keep. What does he want to change? “I want to get on with the job of writing the next manifesto for 2024. Therefore, going through the exercise of 105 pages of the last manifesto of what you would keep and what you wouldn’t doesn’t get us very far.”It’s disingenuous, of course, because keeping parts of the manifesto is largely what Starmer has done with his Corbyn-friendly “10 pledges”. Labour’s free broadband policy is not included. Has it been ditched? It seems so. “You’re tempting me into the thing I wouldn’t do, which is go over the last manifesto. On broadband, the policy was to do it if we got into office within 10 years. By the time we get to five years down the line, all of it is going to have to be rethought.”In trying to explain Labour’s lack of electoral success, Starmer does hint at a wider image problem. “We’ve lost four in a row with different leaders. Therefore, there’s something more fundamental we need to do if we are going to get back into a winning position.”That suggests there is some kind of overhaul ahead, however masked. If he isn’t going to give any indication of how he will change course, how would he reassure members who actually want him to confront the party with difficult issues?Starmer leaves having delivered his pitch to members, but with key questions about the future unanswered. It is a tactic that looks set to deliver him the leadership next month, but those “difficult decisions” will be lurking – and risk swiftly shattering the unity he seeks.Keir StarmerBrexitA big advocate for a second referendum, but has now said the RemainLeave argument is over.

As the clock strikes 11pm on Friday, the UK is officially orced from the EU and will begin trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Here’s a run-through the beginning, the middle and the end.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.Sir Edward Heath\u0026nbspsigns the accession treaty giving entry to the EEC in an official ceremony that was accompanied by a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship.

That’s the message of a week that saw two major premieres of new dance pieces by women choreographers that both made their mark.Cathy Marston has waited long enough for her chance. She’s been associated with the Royal Ballet for 25 years, but The Cellist is the first time she’s been trusted to create for the main stage. It is a considerable piece, full of feeling and imagination, lingering in the mind long after the curtain has come down.In dramatising the life of Jacqueline du Pré (1945-87), the gifted, charismatic cellist who made classical music sexy and vibrant for an entire generation before being struck down by multiple sclerosis at the age of 28, Marston decides to do something very difficult. She makes the central relationship of Du Pré’s life not that with her husband, the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, but with music itself – embodied in the form of her cello.Marcelino Sambé is cast as “the instrument” – no one is named in the cast sheet – who also “narrates” the ballet as a kind of musical fantasy. When he first appears, placed between the knees of a young cellist (lively, lovely Emma Lucano), arm elegantly curved like the cello’s neck, I thought it was all a bit music- and-movementy – a throwback to the kind of ballets that Hollywood films of the 1940s liked to imagine.But the conceit takes hold, thanks in part to Sambé’s impassioned dancing, and to Marston’s choreography, which bends, swerves and swirls as the adult cellist – danced by Lauren Cuthbertson – leans into the sound of the classical hits that Du Pré made her own, woven into an effective score by Philip Feeney. The movement is all circular, a great onward rush of love and passion that evolves into a trio when Matthew Ball’s dashing “conductor” joins the dance, stretching, turning and leaping in slim, sensual lines.There is slightly too much going on in too small a space. Hildegard Bechtler’s set, which conjures the lines of a cello, pinions the dancers into tight curves it’s deliberate but frustrating. A large chorus of supporting dancers takes many parts, sometimes coyly mimicking objects of furniture, sometimes sweeping around the principals. It sometimes works beautifully, as when they arch around Du Pré as the framing instruments in an orchestra (solo cello, Hetty Snell, in the pit, playing Elgar beautifully).But it’s often distracting. The moments that work best are when the elaboration stops and the dancers have time to sketch a feeling – when Kristen McNally’s mother swaddles her daughter in a cardigan, when Cuthbertson soars in ecstasy, and – most affectingly – when she begins to stagger and fall, unable to play, her movements becoming ugly, disjointed and finally still. Sambé gently kisses her hand as he unfolds away from her a moment of utter sorrow.The evening opened with more elusive emotions, in a revival of Jerome Robbins’s Dances at a Gathering, a sequence of glorious dances to the solo piano pieces of Chopin (magnificently performed by Robert Clark), beautifully performed by the entire cast, with Marianela Nuñez, Francesca Hayward and Yasmine Naghdi in particular finding just the right way to communicate its breezy mysteries.Over at the Peacock theatre, choreographer Kate Prince is attempting something even more difficult than Marston. In Message in a Bottle, she has created a popular dance show about the tragedy of the refugee crisis, told through hip-hop dance and the songs of Sting. It sounds improbable, and there were moments towards the beginning when I wondered if she could pull it off. There is a lot vigorous dancing in the cypher to establish a sense of community before a family are split apart by war, and the songs (rearranged by Hamilton’s Alex Lacamoire and sometimes sung by guest vocalists) can feel dragged into the action. (Don’t Stand Too Close to Me makes a particularly uneasy background to a scene in which women are threatened with sexual violence.)But gradually the piece finds its emotional punch, carving space for passages of expressive, almost abstract dance, as it also finds ways of charting the separate fates of two brothers and their sister to a narrative line created with the help of playwright Lolita Chakrabarti. It helps that they are danced with incredible skill and commitment by Natasha Gooden, Lukas McFarlane and Tommy Franzén, whose weightless fluidity enables him to make even the smallest gesture speak volumes.But Prince is also clever at shaping her narrative in compelling ways. There’s a brilliant scene of a raft wrecked on a pounding ocean, conjured by projections, with the orange life jackets of the dancers bobbing in the darkness a rousing plea for freedom set in an internment camp (to the title song) duets of love and estrangement, and above all, a tentatively optimistic close when Sting’s voice soars in They Dance Alone. It’s quite an achievement to bring so complex a subject to the dance stage in this way.Star ratings (out of five)The CellistDances at a Gathering ★★★★Message in a Bottle ★★★★• The CellistDances at a Gathering is at the Royal Opera House until Wednesday 4 March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/410d2c832ecb1db908e9c6439f23b41a7a695178/0_114_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b6dd2a522175e249f8e176d35a7d295","title":"airbnb call english councils powers regulate caroline lucas","story":"Caroline Lucas urges move to help ease ‘intolerable’ pressure on availability of local housingLocal councils in England must be given powers to regulate Airbnb and other short-term letting sites in order to alleviate the “intolerable” pressure they put on the availability of local housing, the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, has said.Her intervention followed a  investigation that found one Airbnb listing for every four residential properties in some hotspots across Britain. Airbnb has disputed the finding.Meanwhile, an organisation representing landlords has warned that imminent tax changes will drive an increasing number of landlords towards Airbnb and its rivals, depriving renters of long-term, stable tenancies.Last month Lucas asked the government to make it easier for councils to impose a 90-day cap on homes let out on Airbnb and other online platforms. Airbnb says the vast majority of properties on the platform are already rented for less than 90 days a year.She wants the UK government to follow Scotland’s lead. In January Holyrood announced new measures giving local authorities in Scotland powers to regulate short-term lets. This includes a licensing scheme with health and safety stipulations, which would also allow councils to address the concerns of local residents. A tax on short-term lets is also being considered.“Brighton and Hove city council should be given the powers to regulate this industry, which is having such a serious impact on an already overstretched private rental sector and on more highly regulated hotels and B\u0026ampBs, which are being undercut. There needs to be a level playing field,” said Lucas.“The pressure put on the availability of local housing by Airbnb in some areas of UK is intolerable. Local councils must be given powers to regulate this, so local housing needs are not squeezed out,” she tweeted on Friday.Airbnb said the ’s data was flawed and that some listings were for hotel rooms, single rooms in homes, and unusual properties such as caravans, meaning their rental did not affect housing stock.Patrick Robinson, the company’s director of public policy, said: “Airbnb is a good partner to cities and we were the first platform to limit how often hosts in London can share their homes. We are also working with cities across the UK on proposals for a host registration system that we will proactively put to the government later this year to help ensure that rules work for everyone.”But some critics of the company in hotspot areas say the saturation of their neighbourhoods is changing their way of life. Chris Hayes, a 55-year-old train driver who lives in the North Laine area of Brighton, said his life was being made a misery because five of the 29 cottages in his row were being advertised on Airbnb and similar sites.“Residents have no way of stopping noise without confrontation. The owners are unknown or uncontactable, the ‘hosts’ do not have contact numbers for out-of-office hours, the council does not have noise abatement officers at night, the police treat it as very low priority,” he said, complaining of being woken by parties and the sound of suitcases being trundled along the alleyway in the middle of the night.He added: “Airbnbs should be a planning change of use from residential. You need a change of use to convert a home to an office, hotel or shop. Why not to Airbnb?”The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) warned on Friday that renters were finding it harder to access long-term homes to rent because taxation changes are driving landlords to move into the holiday lettings market.Last month, research from ARLA Propertymark found that nearly half a million UK properties could be left unavailable for longer-term rent as more landlords exit the market in favour of short-term lettings. Many landlords blame the government for restricting mortgage interest relief to the basic rate of income tax, claiming they will be significantly worse off or even unable to make a profit on their lettings.David Smith, the RLA’s policy director, said: “Government policy is actively encouraging the growth of holiday homes at the expense of long-term homes to rent, which many families need. This is completely counterproductive, making renting more expensive and undermining efforts to help tenants save for a house of their own.“The chancellor must use his budget to give tenants a better deal by supporting good landlords to provide the homes to rent that they want to live in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d350918078d804a7776949f1a614201cba23000d/0_86_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bd5ec699365ae971fbce04a2a503512","title":"tv tonight the trials of a second marriage in last tango in halifax","story":"Sally Wainwright’s drama returns for a fifth season of family friction.

Here’s where we’re at: Elizabeth Warren is continuing to project confidence in her chances of getting the nomination. “Understand this: I’m not in this fight to talk about change. I am in this fight to make change,” said the senator who is known for her detailed plans. Her campaign was re-energized after a strong debate performance this week. But with nearly 75,000 Nevadans voting early, before the debate, it’s unclear whether her post-debate momentum had any impact in Nevada.In Seattle, she addressed a crowd of around 7,000. A supporter asked her who she’d choose as a running mate if she were nominated.“I would be presumptuous at this moment to talk about it, but what I can do is describe,” she said. “That is, I want to partner in this fight. That’s it.”Elizabeth Warren’s message to Nevadans: “Thank you for keeping me in the fight.” Warren, speaking to supporters in Seattle, congratulated Bernie Sanders on his victory in Nevada. “The race has been called. Bernie has won, congratulations Bernie,” she said.But she added that since Wednesday night – the day of the debate – “our support has been growing everywhere.” As she did on debate night, and in the days after, Warren launched into a takedown of Mike Bloomberg.“Michael Bloomberg is not the safest candidate, Michael Bloomberg is the riskiest candidate,” she said. Bloomberg was competing in Nevada, choosing to focus instead on the Super Tuesday states, where Warren will have to claim big gains in order to stay in the race.Here’s where we are: Mike Bloomberg’s campaign manager has put out a statement on Bernie Sanders’ victory in Nevada. Bloomberg did not contest Nevada, but is staking his candidacy on Super Tuesday.The Nevada results reinforce the reality that this fragmented field is putting Bernie Sanders on pace to amass an insurmountable delegate lead. This is a candidate who just declared war on the so-called “Democratic Establishment.” We are going to need Independents AND Republicans to defeat Trump – attacking your own party is no way to get started. As Mike says, if we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base – like Senator Sanders – it will be a fatal error.Elizabeth Warren’s strong performance in last week’s debate wasn’t enough to vault her into a winning position in the Nevada caucuses.Her campaign manager, Roger Lau, is arguing on Twitter that her vote share surged between the early voters and those who showed up in person, however. Bernie Sanders’s strength among Latino voters in Nevada could signal good things for his campaign come Super Tuesday, my colleague Lauren Gambino suggests. The two biggest prizes on 3 March, California and Texas, have significant Latino populations.Here is more on Bernie Sanders’s victory, from my colleagues Maanvi Singh and Sam Levin, who have been reporting from Nevada this week: Warren was pushing for a surge in Nevada after her widely celebrated performance at the debate days earlier in Las Vegas. Warren announced on Saturday she had raised $14m in the last 10 days, double the amount her campaign had set out as a goal ahead of the caucuses.Nevada’s “first-in-the-west” caucuses were also a major test for the campaign of the former vice-president Biden, who was a frontrunner in polls last year but performed poorly in the first two state contests. Biden gave a triumphant speech in Vegas before the results were finalized, and his campaign manager said he appeared to be in second place. “The press is ready to declare people dead quickly. We’re alive. We’re coming back,” Biden said to cheers.Sanders’ remarks provide a strong contrast to those of Buttigieg and Biden. With his frontrunner status cemented, Sanders is focusing his remarks on Donald Trump and his core message of economic justice, with nary a reference to his Democratic rivals. Bernie Sanders declared victory in the Democratic caucuses in Nevada, while speaking at a rally in San Antonio, Texas on Saturday evening.“We won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, and according to three networks and the AP, we have now won the Nevada caucus,” Sanders said.“We’ve put together a multi-generational, multi-racial coalition, which is not only going to win in Nevada, it’s going to sweep this country.” Early voting in Texas, a Super Tuesday state is already underway. “We’re going to win the Democratic primary in Texas,” Sanders told his supporters. Here is how the Associated Press describes its process for calling an election’s results: The responsibility for calling races rests with experienced staff in each state. They are armed with on-the-ground knowledge that no other national news organization can match. Plus, they have information on demographics, absentee and other voting history and political issues that may affect the outcome of races they must call. On election night, they are assisted by experts in AP’s Washington bureau. A “decision desk” in Washington, headed by the Washington bureau chief, has the final signoff on all top-of-the-ticket calls.Most of the television networks rely on Edison Research for exit polls and election projections, which uses exit polling to help project results.

It is believed the Aztecs and Incas were cultivating and eating the tomato from 700AD. Though the tomato originated from the Andean region, it eventually spread north to Mexico. The scientific name for the tomato is solanum lycoperscicum.While the Spanish were responsible for bringing the tomato to Europe in the early 16th century, its first reference in Italy was in 1544 in Pietro Andrea Mattioli’s Herbal, who refers to the tomato as pomi d’oro meaning golden apple. The tomato was not used in cooking until the 18th century as it was often viewed with fear and suspicion as a member of the nightshade plant family, which had plants such as the mandrake among them.Once the names the tomato were called were amended and confusion and ambiguity as to what it was subsided, it was able to illustrate its full potential. After its family ties became less relevant and it was allowed to exist for what it was, not how it looked, it thrived. This took an element of trust.Below, Nightshade’s subjects discuss their favourite recipes.I can tell you, lasagna is the first dish I learned to cook. I moved out from my parents’ house without knowing how to cook even a common pasta but since lasagna and pollo con patate, are my favourite dishes, I learned how to cook them first. Even though making the ragu isn’t so easy. I tried my best and my lasagna is one of the best in town, if you get in Brianza by any chance, you’ve got to taste it.Fry the onion until softened. Add the carrot and cook for five minutes, then add the celery and cook for another two minutes. Turn up the heat, add the chopped beef and cook until browned all over.Make a ragu over an afternoon, pour in the wine and passata, season with salt, pepper and a pinch of grated nutmeg, then bring to a simmer.Make your own béchamel. Place cooked ragu into an overproof dish and layer. Top with parmesan. Garnish with basil.This is a classic Italian recipe. If you ever jump on a plane to Italy, don’t miss it.Since I was a child, this has been my favourite recipe. I remember cooking it for every family party, even for my sister’s wedding. With this recipe you will never go too far wrong. Your guests will love Crostata. This recipe is a mix of authentic Italian flavours, in which lemon and marmellata (jam) are the main ingredients for a unique and refined taste.Good luck and enjoy!Ingredients: 250g cold butter from the fridge | 200g of icing sugar | 500g of 00 flour | 2 eggs | The rind of an untreated lemon | 400g of jam | Enough milk to brush the surface | A pinch of saltPut the flour, butter and a pinch of salt in the mixer. Mix in order to obtain an uneven sandblasting.Add the eggs, icing sugar and lemon peel to flavour the pastry and allow the citric acid to make it crumbly.Knead the dough before putting it onto a work surface. Start working it with the fingertips, to create a nice compact dough. Wrap it in clingfilm and let it rest for 30 minutes in the fridge, or ideally overnight.After letting the dough rest, we heat it and flatten it. Aim for a thickness of 78mm. Transfer the dough into a 24cm diameter cake pan and pinch the bottom with a fork.Then we make our short pastry with jam, we distribute it on the edge. After that, prepare 3 or 4cm strips of dough and place on to the jam, applying pressure to the edges. Lay the strips diagonally creating a grid of pastry and diamond shapes of jam. To make the tart shiny, brush the milk on the pastry with a pastry brush. After that, we bake the tart in a pre-heated oven at 170C for 50 minutes.Fiorentina is one of the most popular and biggest steak in Italian cuisine.I have eaten this more than three times and its taste was undeniable. I think it is one of the best dishes that I often have because it reminds me of Tuscany’s fabulous and iconic lifestyle.Use the highest quality steak, ideally Tuscan or Italian. Cook on an open fire if possible (on the embers of the grill). Rare or medium rare only. Garnish with salt and pepper.Pizza has always been a reason to gather with my friends. Pizzerias were fancy enough for our student pockets. When my mum would make pizza at home, we were always very excited.For me, it was nice to see the first generation of immigrants learning the Italian cooking as their way of integration.Ingredients: Semolina pizza dough | tablespoon olive oil | 2 cloves chopped garlic | 5 mushrooms thinly sliced | mozzarella cheese | 1 can tomatoes | chopped roma | 1 bell pepper| thinly sliced prosciutto | salt \u0026amp pepper to taste | oregano | pepper flakesPreheat oven to its hottest setting for 45 minutes. With about 1 teaspoon olive oil, sauté the sliced mushrooms and a pinch of salt over medium heat for 5-10 minutes, until well browned. Set aside.Sprinkle semolina on your baking sheet. Place the dough on top of the semolina and roll out into a circular shape. Brush the outer edges with olive oil and chopped garlic. Spread chopped tomatoes from the centre out to the edge of the oiled crust.Evenly place your toppings (mushrooms, mozzarella, bell pepper, etc) on the dough. Sprinkle with salt, Italian seasoning and pepper flakes, to taste. Add Parmesan cheese if desired.Transfer the pizza onto your stone by sliding it off the baking sheet. Bake for 10+ minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned and the cheese is bubbly. Remove with tongs and let rest for five minutes.I usually cook it during summer for lunch, after a long morning at the beach. It is easy, quick and everyone loves it, including my kids. The pepper is not that hot. It is a plate that I particularly love because I buy the shrimps fresh from the local fish store near the beach.Ingredients: Shrimps from Marsala Tomatoes from pachino | 300g spaghetti | Olive oil | Garlic | Hot pepper | SaltIn a frying pan add some oil, garlic and hot pepper then mix all together until the mixture becomes a little golden. In the meantime, boil some water for the pasta.Add two or three tablespoons of the boiling water into the mixture. Then let it sit for a couple of minutes until the pasta is cooked. Add salt and pepper. Mix everything together.Aubergines are my all-time favourite late summerwinter vegetable. This dish reminds me of childhood, having a family meal at a local tavola calda. It can be eaten as a standalone dish or as part of a secondo piatto. It’s one of the most unassuming yet deliciously hearty dishes. I’ve probably adulterated the dish to suit my palette but this is a firm favourite for me to prepare for my nearest and dearest. If you want a leaner version of this dish, try grilling the aubergines instead. An exceptionally tasty vegetarian treat.Ingredients: 3 large aubergines | 1 bottle of tomato passata | 2 cloves of garlic 2 balls of mozzarella | 1 cup of parmigiano reggiano (grated) | 1 cup of extra virgin olive oil | 1 cup flour | 1 cup vegetable oil | Black pepper to taste | Fresh basil to taste | Salt to tastePreheat oven to 180C (356F). Slice aubergines lengthways but leave skin on. Place in a bowl and sprinkle two tablespoons of salt over them and leave for an hour to remove the moisture.In the meantime prepare the sauce. Add two teaspoons of olive oil to a pan and finely chop garlic cloves. Fry until softened. Add passata and cook on medium heat on hob for 15 minutes. Tear and add fresh basil and black pepper and salt. Cook for a further 10 minutes. Chop mozzarella into small cubes.Place flour into a bowl. Take aubergines out of salt and coat each in the flour. Prepare a new pan with two tablespoons vegetable oil and fry off flour coated aubergines- about 1-2 minutes each side. Place on kitchen towel to absorb oil. Add more cooking oil to pan if required.Prepare an oven baking dish. Start by spoon- ing some of the passata onto the base. Then place a layer of aubergines on top, add some passata, parmesan and mozzarella. Repeat until all ingredients have been used.Bake for 25-30 minutes. Serve with a sprig of basil and enjoy this heart-warming beautiful dish.This is a classic Italian antipasto. It is the perfect dish for when you invite your friend for dinner because it is easy to make and very tasty.Slice mozzarella and tomato and place on plate. Apply a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt, pepper and fresh oregano.This dish reminds me of the long summers in my childhood, and I used to enjoy this on a picnic or by the beach. It brings memories of laughs, sun, water, running barefoot in the hot sand, beach games and the joy of eating all together.Ingredients: 4-5 medium firm ripe round tomatoes seeded and hollowed out | 1 cup uncooked rice (I used long grain par boiled) 185 grams | 1 teaspoon oregano 12 gram | 1 teaspoon basil 12 gram | 12 teaspoon salt 2 12 grams | 12 gram *6 springs fresh chopped Italian parsley | 1 clove garlic chopped | 14 - 12 cup chopped tomato pulp 55-82 grams | 2-3 tablespoons olive oilPre-heat oven to 180C (375F) and lightly oil a large baking pan. In a medium bowl add rice and cover with water, allowing it soak for one hour, then drain and rinse.Rinse and dry tomatoes, carefully cut off top of tomato and set aside. Remove seed and pulp from the tomatoes, set aside the pulp and discard the seeds.In a medium bowl mix chopped tomato pulp, oregano, salt, parsley, garlic, 2-3 tablespoons (45 grams) olive oil and rice. Fill hollowed out tomatoes with mixture. Place tops back on tomatoes, sprinkle tomatoes with a little salt and drizzle with olive oil.Add roasted potatoes with rosemary and bake for approximately 45- 60 minutes or until potatoes and rice are tender. Serve immediately. Enjoy.This is my favourite dish for three reasons: though based on rather basic ingredients, it is unabashedly rich and indulgent its reddishorangey colours evoke those of my favourite team (AS Roma), and you can do an excellent version of it in under 30 minutes.Ingredients: Guanciale (cured Italian pig cheek. Do not use pancetta in any circumstance) | Pecorino Romano (abundant) | Tomato passata Calabrian chili | Salt | Pepper | Rigatoni or bucatini | WineDice the guanciale into thin strips. Remember to remove the hard part of the skin, and to slice off a bit of fat if the ratio of meat to fat is less than 1:3. Add to a non-stick pan at medium heat and let it heat gently until the guanciale is crispy and the fat renders.Add a splash of dry white wine (like a frascati), to deglaze the pan. This step is optional. Once the alcohol has evaporated, add some flakes of chilli and a high-quality tomato passata (or blended chopped tomatoes). Add some seasoning (but not too much salt), and let it simmer on a medium heat.In the meantime, bring water to the boil, and add either rigatoni (short pasta) or bucatini, depending on your (and guests’) preference. Tip: growing up I was always told that the water of the pasta must be as salty as the Mediterranean. Few things are more upsetting than an under-salted pasta. So be generous when salting the boiling water for pasta. Two minutes before the pasta is ready, set aside some of the starchy boiling water, and then quickly decant and add to the sauce.Another tip: always toss pasta into sauce, not vice versa. The pasta is at its most absorbent in the 10 seconds after it has been drained, so don’t waste time in mixing it with the sauce. As you toss it in, add in generous heaps of grated pecorino cheese, which should gently melt. This renders the sauce less red but also thicker. Use the water set aside to regulate the consistency. A good amatriciana must have a touch of sleepiness to it.Plate - on a heated plate preferably, add some grated pecorino and buon appetito."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d6e2ec908e7f900d6d7dbaba09b01589fffa4ff/0_263_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d24580e4ae5c568de59d918ab9102f82","title":"post apocalyptic how coronavirus has altered day to day life wuhan north england","story":"From Wuhan to the north of England, people have been affected by the outbreak in different waysThe coronavirus is a public health emergency, but its threat is not only medical. Millions of lives have been altered by the outbreak, from those in self-isolation in China to Chinese nationals experiencing racism abroad. We talk to those affected in different ways, from Wuhan to the north of England.Wi, a 29-year-old Chinese PhD student in the Midlands, is originally from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak and where her parents have been in self-quarantine for more than 20 days. “They can’t walk, they can’t leave their own flat – it’s not a holiday, it’s like jail,” she said. “They are unable to even open windows for fear that the virus will spread through the air.“Now the whole of Wuhan is closed, all public transport and private cars have been stopped, so they can’t even drive their own cars on the road. So they just stay at home, eating, sleeping and watching movies. That’s all they can do,” Wi said.Wi’s parents have not been told when they will be allowed to leave their flat. Wi has become concerned about the mental health of those in isolation in the city, after seeing posts on social media with locals saying they would rather kill themselves than remain in quarantine any longer.“The biggest enemy is not the virus, it’s mental health. When you stay in one room for half a month, that’s horrible, you cannot go outside or get fresh air.”A hundred miles from Wuhan, nestled in the countryside of Hubei province, British teacher Claude* is in self-isolation with his Chinese girlfriend and her family in her hometown, which the pair were visiting for the lunar new year.“After a day or two it became a ghost town,” Claude, 46, said. “The first week I was just relaxing – I work near Hong Kong so this was my holiday. I thought I would have more cabin fever by now, but I’m actually pretty fine. My girlfriends’s family are cooking lots and cleaning for us, so I’m being spoilt.” He described the town as “post-apocalyptic”, with speakers playing American swing music on empty streets, and men in biohazard suits checking people’s temperatures before they enter Walmart. He and his girlfriend still do not know when they will be allowed to leave. But when they finally return to their home in Shenzhen, they will be required to undergo another two weeks in quarantine.Claude said the mood in the town was “pretty chilled out”, but feared this could change in coming weeks as supplies run low. “As the days go on, more people are wearing masks, and people are standing further and further apart,” he said.In neighbouring Hunan province, Yuhan, a 28-year-old Chinese national who lives and works in Melbourne, is also trapped, after returning to visit her family for the new year.She has been in self-quarantine with her parents for 29 days, leaving only to visit her grandmother who lives 200 metres away. Yuhan worries that the isolation could last another two weeks.The family order groceries online once every two or three days, and spend most of their time cooking and watching TV. They usually go to her grandmother’s for lunch and leave food for her dinner. But Yuhan said many of her friends’ families would not leave the house at all.“My grandma keeps wanting to go out for walks, especially when it’s sunny, but I always try to stop her and walk around the apartment with her,” she said. “It is sometimes hard to explain to my grandma how dangerous things still are, as official news on TV is mainly good news.”In the country’s most populous city, Shanghai, many foreign teachers are beginning to fear for their jobs.Rob, a 23-year-old teacher at an international kindergarten in the city, said about 25 other teachers had lost their jobs during the outbreak, after parents refused to send their children back to school for their final term. This has left the teachers with just 30 days to find work before their visas expire.“The worrying thing is that once these teachers have their work visas cancelled, their medical insurance goes too,” he said. “The school has said they can’t do anything – they need to lay them off because the profit margins are too tight, and it’s illegal not to cancel their visas if they’re not working.”Rob could not fly home to the UK as planned, so instead flew to Bangkok. Now back in Shanghai, he told of people being charged £6 for face masks, and others having to go without if they missed the daily registration for them. He had also been warned of landlords taking their tenants’ allocation of masks, claiming that as homeowners, the masks given to each household should go to them.Some people who have travelled through China have criticised airline checks designed to prevent the spread of the virus. Dave* was on holiday in Bangkok with his partner and travelled back to the UK via Beijing with Air China, wearing face masks and swimming goggles.Airline staff took the temperatures of passengers at Bangkok, where four people “blatantly tested far above the threshold” but were allowed to board after short arguments with flight attendants, said the 39-year-old. “My partner and I both thought the flight was tense, and the flight crew were visibly nervous on both sides. Some people didn’t seem too fussed about it, and I got the impression that a lot of people were half-hearted, like wearing masks that weren’t properly over their face.”At Heathrow, there were no checks or information. “It was just like flying to Heathrow on any other day,” he said. “I was expecting at least some information on contacting Public Health England, but there weren’t even any posters. Us and a litany of sick coughing people from an Air China flight waltzed right out the airport.“There was hand sanitiser everywhere but no one seemed to use it,” he added. “I felt it was all a bit half-arsed.”Back in the UK, the Chinese community are feeling the effects of the virus. Lee*, a Chinese PhD student in the north of England, was subjected to racist abuse on a night out because of the coronavirus. He said he and two Chinese friends were on their way to a shopping centre one evening when three men in a car began shouting at them. “They called us ‘Chinese virus’ and ‘you Chinese bastards’,” Lee said.“We were really afraid. We passed them quickly and we kept silent because we were scared they might do something violent. There was nobody else out on the street and we wanted to stay safe. It felt very dangerous at the time.”Lee said that since the incident he has stayed at home more, only going out for university meetings or shopping for food. He feels that since the outbreak cultural differences are causing issues. The British do not tend to wear face masks but it is normal for Asian people, he said. “Now my Chinese friends get stared at for wearing them.” *Some names have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/763b6d11f7e6970a233b8b7329388ff57a3c3ffc/23_368_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51a3202dad8e10059a343153c452d232","title":"iran elections conservatives heading for large majority","story":"Likely outcome reflects frustration at collapsing living standards and relations with the westIran’s conservatives are on the brink of a landslide victory in the country’s parliamentary elections as forecasts show them taking more than two-thirds of the seats.The reformists, the largest grouping in the outgoing parliament, have been decisively beaten, with predictions showing them taking only 17 seats in the 290-strong parliament. The principalists – or conservatives – were on course to take around 200 seats, including all 30 seats in the capital, Tehran, previously a stronghold of the reformers.Although they are a erse group, many of the senior conservatives are former supporters of ex-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The result is a rebuff for those that had pushed for greater engagement with the west, and is likely to constrain Iran’s foreign policy options. The parliament could press for Iran to quit the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.Mojtaba Rezai, a mechanic, said: “They are just a bunch of gangsters. They just choose between the 10 of them who is going to lead their list and we get no say. They are not lists, but shits.”In north Tehran around the Cinema Museum, the mood was indifferent, as people said they knew no one in their family who had voted, nor intended to vote again.A shopper in central Tehran laughed when asked if they had heard the results, saying: “Why should we wait for the result? It is a foregone conclusion and has been fixed in advance. They can do what they want, and we just have to get on making a living. We face years more of sanctions.”The rial was coming under further pressure against the dollar after the blacklisting of Iran by the Financial Action Task Force on Friday.Mostafa Tajzadeh, one of the most prominent reformist politicians, who was formerly imprisoned in Evin prison, said: “We are facing a difficult and complex situation made worse by the low levels of participation. Why did the supreme leader not warn the  Council against not allowing independent and critical voices to stand? The price has been low participation, and a parliament that only represents the minority.”Other more radical voices said the landslide was what they wanted since it showed the people they had no route through parliament to achieve change.The deadline for closing the 55,000 polling booths on Friday was repeatedly extended, with pro-government sources claiming the polls were kept open until midnight to cope with high turnout. Government opponents said officials had been hoping a last-minute rush might mask a voter boycott in the big cities caused by disillusionment with Iranian politics.The run-up to the election, dismissed as a farce by the US government, had been marred by the mass disqualification of the best-known centrist candidates, some of whom, such as Ali Motahari, nevertheless turned out to vote in Tehran.The result means strong supporters of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei now control all the main levers of power in Iran except for the presidency. The reformists, elected four years ago on a ticket of engagement with the west, had been the largest party in the parliament, but found many of their proposals blocked by other centres of power in Iran, notably the  Council.Presidential elections are due next year, leaving the centrist incumbent, Hassan Rouhani, to navigate a difficult year engaging with a strong, largely unsympathetic parliament.The initial results showed that as many as 14 senior figures in Ahmadinejad’s presidency had been elected, as well as his former central bank governor.The former mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, an Iran-Iraq war veteran and former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was also victorious in Tehran, putting him in a strong position to take over the parliament’s speakership.That post had previously been held by Ali Larijani who stood down preparing for a likely run at the presidency.Reformers have threatened to pursue Ghalibaf over property deals from which he benefited as mayor of Tehran.About 7,150 candidates from more than 16,000 hopefuls survived screening by government-run panels and the  Council, a conservative body of clerics and jurists who assess commitment to Islam, belief in the system of religious law and the Islamic Republic.A third of incumbents were barred from standing again. Moderates, who see disqualifications as a bid by hardliners to dominate the 2021 presidential race, say they had no candidates in the contest for 230 of the assembly’s 290 seats.Parliament has no formal role over foreign policy, but it can intervene if Rouhani tries to engage in any talks with the US before a lifting of sanctions.The Iranian foreign ministry believes Donald Trump has been gripped by a fantasy that the maximum economic pressure is going to lead to the Iranian regime’s fall. The election results, despite the low turnout, arguably show the regime’s power has been enhanced.Many Iranian voters said they would be willing to withstand another six years of sanctions for the sake of their country’s independence.Figures such as Motahari defended the reformist-led parliament’s record, saying external bodies had blocked more than half of its legislation. He cited the parliament being excluded when the government suddenly doubled petrol prices in November, prompting state repression of street protests. He said parliament had wanted to impeach the interior ministry for its handling of the protests, but were ordered not to do so.The government has yet to reveal the numbers it claims were killed by the state in the four days of protests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72de43253867a6c412c7fb46110b5b3a61e53d39/0_192_3656_2194/master/3656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4038f5b28a0de87c4f0c04562792e02a","title":"macron astonished french farmer praise brussels","story":"The unexpected show of approval came as the French president is faced with ever more protestsSomething unusual happened to President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday: he was praised by a member of the French public.“Well done for holding firm in Brussels,” said a farmer at France’s annual agricultural show.The rest of the day was mostly thankless: a 12-hour marathon of nibbling cheese and steak from cocktail sticks while fielding complaints about farm pensions (too small), pesticides (newly restricted) and the future of the common agricultural policy (menaced by post-Brexit cuts).Macron has been parsimonious with public appearances in France since strikes and demonstrations about his reform of the state pension system began 10 weeks ago. He spent the whole day on Saturday mingling (security permitting) with crowds at French farming’s annual gala event, the Salon International de L’Agriculture at the Porte de Versailles in Paris.This is not a rendezvous that any French president can refuse. In the 1990s, Jacques Chirac turned it into an encounter group between the president and France’s supposedly rural soul.An attempt by a handful of gilets jaunes to reach Macron was blocked by police and security guards. Eric Drouet, one of the yellow vest movement’s original leaders, was carted off amid scuffling and TV lights. He was later placed under formal arrest for resisting.Another protester had more luck. She said that she was a “financial controller” and a veteran of all 67 Saturdays of the diminishing yellow vest protests. Yesterday, she became the first gilet jaune ever to speak to Macron.She complained that the French police were too violent (sometimes true). Macron replied that the gilets jaunes were sometimes violent (true) very few in number these days (also true) and that they often protested against stuff that was untrue (which is sometimes true).Macron said that he would meet a “structured” group of protesters for an hour in the Elysée Palace if the woman would organise it. Since the gilets jaunes hate leaders and are allergic to structure, this meeting is unlikely to happen.A grassroots citizens’ protest movement began in early November 2018 against a planned rise in the tax on diesel and petrol, which\u0026nbspEmmanuel Macron\u0026nbspinsisted would aid the country’s transition to green energy. A poll at the time found that the price of fuel had become France’s biggest talking point.The movement was named “gilets jaunes” (yellow vests) because protesters wear the fluorescent yellow high-vis jackets that all motorists must by law carry in their cars. But what began as a fuel tax protest morphed into a wider anti-government movement.Unlike previous French protest movements, it sprang up online through petitions and was organised by ordinary working people posting videos on social media, without a set leader, trade union or political party behind it.At other points in the day, the president was upbraided by farmers or groups of farmers for, inter alia, imposing a ban on the use of pesticides near houses and failing to apply a promised boost in farm pensions to farmers who are already retired.Macron had hoped to come to the show as the man who fought off attempts to cut EU farm spending at the Brussels summit on Thursday and Friday. Unfortunately for him, the summit broke up without agreement.“Well done for holding firm in Brussels,” the farmer said. Macron looked at him in astonishment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e2caf4d6c63af6eae63a2957ef3fbefc5e7944/0_79_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003332450c0e92181184b95a2c960875","title":"south korea tests coronavirus thousands religious sect members","story":"Country confirms more than 430 cases as WHO head voices concern over sixth death in IranThousands of members of a secretive religious sect in South Korea are being screened for the new coronavirus after more than 430 cases were confirmed in the country by officials, one of several fresh clusters of the disease globally.More than 78,000 people around the world have been infected by the Covid-19 virus, with most cases in mainland China, though clusters that have unclear origins have emerged in Singapore, Iran and South Korea.In Iran, a sixth death was confirmed on Saturday, prompting Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, to say he was especially concerned about the country. So far, 28 cases have been identified across four cities, but experts have speculated that many more infections are likely to remain undetected, and it is believed cases that have since appeared in Canada and Lebanon are linked to Iran. Infections in the country are believed to have begun in the city of Qom, but it is unclear how.There is also uncertainty in Singapore, where eight out of 85 infections appear to have no links to previous cases, and in South Korea, where links to a controversial church are being investigated.On Saturday, Ghebreyesus expressed concern about cases that have been identified where a patient has had no contact with a confirmed infected person, and has not travelled to China.“Although the total number of Covid-19 cases outside China remains relatively small, we are concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link,” he said.Andrew Tatem, a professor within geography and environmental science at the University of Southampton, said: “Prior to the recent news of apparent outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran, it seemed like the relatively low number of cases outside of China and with no link to travelling there pointed to hope that the virus could be contained. This recent news, particularly regarding Iran, is especially worrying.”In the South Korean city of Daegu, where most of the country’s cases have been concentrated, officials are racing to screen worshippers who they believe may have been exposed to the virus at a service run by a controversial church. The city’s 2.5 million people have been advised to stay in their homes if possible, while officials are sending medical supplies and clinical staff. Across Daegu and nearby areas, 354 cases have been recorded.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.Yoon-sook Lee, a restaurant owner in Yulha-dong, Daegu, said the city’s streets were deserted. “Those who are outside are half-running as if they are all in a hurry or being chased,” she said, adding that people had been stockpiling water and instant noodles.“I’m starting to feel panicky as I’m worried about my family. I have young children so I’m worried about them. I’m also getting really worried about how long this will go on as it will affect our family’s income,” she said. Her restaurant provides catering for events, but all orders have been cancelled.About 230 cases in South Korea have been linked to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, while scores of cases on a mental health ward at Cheongdo hospital may also be related to the sect. The exact source of these infections remains unclear. While health officials are trying to trace more than 1,000 people who had contact with a 61-year-old woman who attended services at the church, it is believed the virus was present before she tested positive.The church said in a statement on its website that it had more than 120 students in China enrolled on its bible course but had no physical building or meeting place.“The church leaders have told us that this is a test by the devil as he is jealous of the expansion of our church and I believe that is the case,” said one of the church’s members, who asked not to be named but said she had not attended the service linked to the outbreak. “I hope that this situation will make our church stronger. We get persecuted by other people as it is, so this situation is even tougher for us.”The church is accused by many of being a cult and its members often remain distant from outsiders and do not disclose their beliefs to family and friends. Its leadership has shared the names of people who attended its services with the authorities, and about 1,000 are being assigned a government worker to monitor for any symptoms. Secrecy surrounding the sect, however, means such contact-tracing work is even more challenging.Worshippers attend small local services twice a week, as well as larger gatherings – such as the Daegu service linked to the current cluster of cases. These bigger services can attract hundreds of people from across the country, where the church has a total of 230,000 members. Attendees kneel closely together on the floor, chant, and shake hands with those around them.The church said it had shut all branches and centres and was disinfecting its facilities. Members sat on the floor at services in order to allow as many people to attend as possible, it added.Across the city, large gatherings have been banned and nurseries closed, while soldiers have been forbidden from leaving their barracks after several military personnel tested positive. A Samsung plant in Gumi, near Daegu, that employs hundreds of people has also been closed after a worker tested positive.Italy has recorded two deaths linked to the virus, prompting officials to place dozens of towns in Lombardy and Veneto, in the north of the country, under effective lockdown. Confirmed case numbers in the country have risen to 79.In China, where more than 2,300 people have died in the outbreak, there were 397 additional cases on Friday.Tedros said the biggest concern continued to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems.Associated Press contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a28e7ae3b05f01317c63caae9ea4033b4552f70/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641129262ae6b95742e4753e97285bc4","title":"coronavirus northern italian towns close schools and businesses","story":"Authorities act on cluster of infections in the Lombardy and Veneto regionsA dozen towns in northern Italy effectively went into lockdown on Saturday after deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China, and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad.The secondary contagions prompted authorities in some Lombardy and Veneto towns to close schools, businesses and restaurants, and to cancel sporting events and religious services. The mayor of Milan, Italy’s business capital and the regional capital of Lombardy, shuttered public offices.A 78-year-old man infected with the coronavirus died in Veneto, and a postmortem test performed on a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy came back positive, although it wasn’t clear if illness from the virus caused her death.Hundreds of residents and workers who had come into contact with people who tested positive were put into isolation pending results of their tests. Civil protection crews set up a tent camp outside a closed hospital in Veneto to screen medical staff.In the town of Codogno, where the first patient identified in the northern cluster was in a critical condition, closed supermarkets, restaurants and shops made the main street practically a ghost town. The few people outside wore face masks, which were coveted items after selling out at pharmacies.Late Saturday, civil protection officials said 79 people had contracted the virus, including the two who died, and one who recovered. Of the remaining 76 people infected, 54 were in Lombardy, 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia-Romagna, two – a Chinese couple from Wuhan – in Lazio, and one in Piedmont.Lombardy government authorities said the region’s cases were traceable to a 38-year-old Italian who had not travelled to China, but it remained unclear how this man had been infected. Ten towns in Lombardy received orders to suspend nonessential activities and services.Luca Zaia, the Veneto regional president, said on Saturday that the contagion showed that the virus is transmitted like any flu, and that trying to pinpoint a single source for the cases or to establish a link to China were no longer effective containment measures.However, the man who died in Veneto had not met the main risk factors for the virus when he was diagnosed with pneumonia two weeks ago. He had not travelled to China, nor come into contact with anyone who had. Therefore he was only tested for the virus after he did not respond to conventional pneumonia treatment, and by then it was too late, according to Francesca Russo, the head of healthcare for the Veneto region.Along with eight other infected people, the man who died formed a cluster in his hometown of Vo’ Euganeo, population 3,300. Russo expressed relief that to date, none of the hospital personnel who treated the man have tested positive for the virus.Giulio Gallera, the Lombardy health and welfare ministry chief, also said that the region’s casescomprised a traceable cluster, but that officials were still stumped about where it had originated from. The first person to fall ill had met with a man who had returned from China on 21 January, but this man tested negative for the virus and has been ruled out as the source.Other people had acquired their infections from the 38-year-old, either through contact with him or at the hospital in Codogno where he first received treatment on 18 February.More than 250 tests were completed in Lombardy, though hundreds more were being processed, including among the sick man’s colleagues at a Unilever plant near Codogno where he worked, Gallera said. “Given how contagious it is, it’s possible the numbers will increase,” he said.National and regional officials approved an ordinance that put 10 Lombardy towns in effective lockdown around Lodi, southeast of Milan, after the region reported a quadrupling of cases on Friday. But inidual cities outside the area covered by the ordinance, such as Cremona, issued their own restrictions after confirming there were local cases.In Milan itself, however, Milan Fashion Week was wrapping up, though chatter about the rising numbers accompanied the runway shows.“It doesn’t seem to me in this moment for what regards our sector, our fashion week, that there are signs of danger,’’ Carlo Capasa, president of the Italian National Fashion Chamber, told The Associated Press. ‘“We are tranquil and prudent.”However, the world’s largest eyewear trade fair, MIDO, announced it was putting off its Milan show until June because of the outbreak, and the postponement of three Serie A football matches has been confirmed.Despite the alarm, authorities urged calm and tried to balance precautionary closures with the economic reality of regions highly dependent on tourism and commerce. Hotel reservations in Venice were down one-third during the first weekend of Carnival, though the floods in the lagoon city late last year are likely to have scared off visitors.“This is not an Italian ‘Wuhan’,” insisted Ivana Jlenic, president of the federation of Italian tourism and travel agencies, Fiavet. “Avoiding all travel at this time would just be alarmist.”In Rome, doctors at the Spallanzani infectious disease hospital treating the first three people in Italy found to be infected with the virus – the Chinese couple from Wuhan and an Italian who contracted the virus in China – reported encouraging news on an otherwise bleak day. The Italian patient who tested positive for the virus two weeks ago was cleared to leave the hospital, while one of the Chinese visitors tested negative for the first time.Separately on Saturday, 19 Italians who had spent more than two weeks quarantined on a virus-stricken cruise liner in Japan landed at Rome’s military Pratica di Mare airport. They had been stranded on the Diamond Princess since 5 February. Following first health checks and a decontamination process, the passengers were transferred to the military campus of Cecchignola, where they will spend a 14-day isolation period."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4172516.1581585950!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how have our grey seals adapted to eat venomous weever fish","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGrey seals tend to eat fish whole. Illustration: Michael VineyIreland can boast one of the least toxic terrains on the planet, at least for people. With the exception of a few deadly mushrooms, which are avoidable, the most poisonous wildlife drifts in from outside – notably a few stinging jellyfish.Few if any of our fellow mammals in Ireland have needed to evolve ways of eating other, venomous, creatures. In the rest of the world at least 3O mammals are known to have developed biochemical defences that negate a poison or numb response to pain.That could be said, I suppose, about Ireland’s badgers and pine martens, attacking bees’ and wasps’ nests for grubs. But our hedgehogs, unlike some of those in continental Europe, do not include scorpions or vipers in their prey.All this makes it more intriguing that some Irish grey seals may specialise in eating the venomous weever fish, Echiichthys vipera, whose piercing of any human foot can prove extremely painful.Wintering at the moment in near-hibernation in deeper, warmer water at perhaps 150 metres, the hand-size lesser weever returns to the shallows in early summer, burrowing into the sand and resting there with just its eyes and the tip of its black dorsal fin exposed. Its ambition is the ambush of little fish such as blennies and gobies with a dart of its upward-pointing mouth.It is also equipped to punish anything that tries to eat it, or otherwise presses on its venomous dorsal spines. It can stay buried as the tide recedes and wait in the sand until the water comes back.Fear of the weever would occasionally haunt my own childhood paddling on the intertidal sands of Sussex. The memory was revived a year or two ago when Mayo surfers at nearby Carrowniskey began writing agitated blogs about the apparent concentration of weevers on that strand. “On the rare occasions when it is plentiful,” one expert wrote, “rows of erect black triangles decorate the sand floor of the seabed.”Something like that may have supplied the remarkable appetite of some seals for weevers reported in Biology and Environment, the journal of the Royal Irish Academy. The discovery is a spin-off from a study by four researchers at UCC, led by Dr Martha Gosch, examining the diet of grey seals for potential impact on commercial fisheries.Repeat offeringsThis entailed gathering some 150 seal scat (droppings, faeces) from sand banks at Raven Point in Wexford Harbour used as a haul-out by up to 300 animals. Collected between cleansing tides and across two years, the scats were unlikely to repeat offerings from the same iniduals.Weever remains, including the bony otoliths of the inner ear (a standard identification of fish), were found in 4 per cent of the droppings, including one scat with remains of 76 of them, plus one sign of flatfish. The relatively high abundance of weever in a limited number of scats, the study concluded, was “some evidence for specialisation”.It also suggested that the seals had developed a way of eating the fish without suffering from the venom. The skin inside a seal’s mouth and oesophagus is not especially thick compared with that of the leatherback turtle, which regularly eats jellyfish with toxic stings. Grey seals tend to eat fish whole, suggesting that they may have learned to gulp weevers head first, helping to push the poison spine flat.Seals themselves figure among specialised choices of prey. Wildlife films have shown spectacular and chilling sequences of killer whales (orcas) killing seals, surging onto beaches to drag them into the sea on the southern coast of Argentina or ganging up to make waves that wash Arctic seals off ice floes.Given the abundance of seals off Ireland and Scotland, this has me wondering why the orcas – two separate groups with seven or eight in each – have seemed to leave them alone.Some genetic research on orcas, including those of the north Atlantic, suggests that their small social groups have created “cultures” of hunting that are genetically inherited. Some, more nomadic, groups are seal eaters while others hunt fish and seabirds off particular coasts. The orcas that commute between west Scotland and Ireland are well-known as fish eaters, though others have been filmed eating harbour porpoises off Scotland. At Shetland last September, orcas were videoed flipping a harbour seal pup into the air, like the playful assassins of Argentina. And new research from the University of Aberdeen potentially links the orcas to a dramatic decline in numbers of Scotland’s harbour seals, with numbers in Orkney and Shetland dropping by 40 per cent in five years.Unlike the grey seals, which pup in late autumn, the smaller harbour seals pup in June and July, the months when most orca sightings are reported to the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group. The last harbour seal surveys, almost two decades ago, found more than 4,000 of them around Ireland’coasts. It may soon seem appropriate to count them again."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Security alert sparked following report of suspicious object in Newtownabbey\u0026lsquoYou can\u0026rsquot say stuff, because it\u0026rsquos racism, but it will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion\u0026rsquoDiarmuid Martin reacts to findings of report on late disabilities network founder Jean VanierParty to meet Fianna F\u0026aacuteil next week, R\u0026oacuteis\u0026iacuten Shortall confirms\u0026lsquoAssociation with the enemy... cannot be allowed to continue with impunity\u0026rsquoViktoras Andriejevas faced seven years in jail after pleading guilty to number of offencesMarine contractor is continuing with preparations to airlift off barrels of machine oilMan (40s) killed in separate road traffic collision in Co Kilkenny early on SaturdayStatus yellow rain warning issued for most of the north west and midland countiesRebecca Harkin quarantined in Darwin after leaving Diamond Princess cruise linerTeen barricaded himself into Letterkenny house with shotgun and ammunitionMan hits patrol car after shooting in direction of garda\u0026iacuteThe final is on February 28th with the motion: \u0026lsquoThis house believes that the Irish criminal justice system is too weak on crime\u0026rsquoFor six decades, participants in the annual event have argued burning issues of the daySource calls report\u0026rsquos findings into Jean Vanier \u0026lsquodevastating, just bloody devastating\u0026rsquoL\u0026rsquoArche, which helps people with intellectual disabilities, has four communities in IrelandDoctor was previously found guilty of poor professional performance over hysterectomyStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4182237.1582400410!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"viable device left in armagh residential area could have been devastating","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResidents were evacuated from the street, which is close to the Abbey Centre on the outskirts of Belfast.

The couple have criticised the conditions at the hospital.Although just nine people have been diagnosed with the virus in the UK, the NHS has now carried out 6,152 tests on suspected cases.Each case can keep an ambulance off the road for up to eight hours, with each vehicle having to be decontaminated before it can be used again. Now the NHS is to ask patients with suspected coronavirus to drive to health centre car parks, with nurses in Hazmat gear swabbing them through a rolled-down window. The scheme, being pioneered by a London trust, comes alongside the rollout of “home testing” for coronavirus  - with nurses and doctors increasingly asked to visit patients at home to collect their samples. Central London Community Healthcare NHS trust will launch the drive thru  scheme in the car park of one of its health centres on Monday.NHS sources said other trusts were watching the scheme with interest, meaning the initiative could be rolled out more widely if it is a success. The scheme at Parsons Green Health Centre, in west London, is intended to relieve pressure on hospital and ambulance services. However, the plans have sparked some concern that those who are unable to drive may be asked if they have someone who can take them to the centre, potentially putting an extra person in danger of infection. Nurses based at the centre will be asked to don protective clothing before travelling outside to collect swabs from patients in their cars, with patients then asked to return home, unless they are feeling ill.  Only patients referred by NHS 111 will be sent to the drive thru service, with pregnant women and those thought to be seriously ill excluded under its protocols.Other NHS trusts have begun piloting home-testing for coronavirus.Professor Keith Willett, the NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus, said testing people in their own homes rather than taking them to hospital would help to limit the spread of infection.Dr Laurence John, an infectious diseases expert at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, said it has become clear that it is “very inefficient” to transport everyone in need of tests to hospital. He said the need for new approaches became clear after 25 London ambulances ended up out of service on the same afternoon, because of the demands of testing. University College London Hospitals Foundation trust, Guys and St Thomas Hospital Foundation trust and St George’s University Hospitals Foundation trust have also embarked on home-testing schemes. Because of the need to keep patients with suspected coronavirus in isolation, health officials stress that anyone concerned they may be suffering from the virus should call 111, rather than go to their GP or hospital. In Italy the death of two people has led to shops and schools closing to try to halt a rise in new infections. The death of a 75-year-old woman on Saturday near the small town of Codogno in Lombardy came one day after a 78-year-old man succumbed to the virus in the neighbouring region of Veneto, marking the first in Italy and Europe.Iran yesterday ordered the closure of schools and universities in two cities hit by a coronavirus outbreak that has killed five people in the Islamic republic - the most outside the Far East.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"erdogan cant afford back conflict assad russia","story":"Nearly a million civilians, 81 per cnet of them women and children, have been displaced from their homes in 90 days in Syria’s northwestern province of Idlib, amid a brutal military campaign by Syria’s Assad regime, Russia and Iran-backed militias.In the last two months alone, 72 hospitals and medical clinics have been destroyed or forced to close, removing more than 550 healthcare personnel from service. At least seven children have frozen to death in recent weeks. What has resulted is the greatest humanitarian crisis in Syria’s nine-year war and the most significant incidence of human suffering in modern history.Nearly two million civilians now reside in tent camps or in open fields along the border with Turkey, a country already home to a staggering 3.7 million Syrian refugees. For Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the crisis across his border is an existential one. Already under domestic pressure to encourage refugees to return to Syria, a huge wave of new refugees would kill his future re-election prospects.Worse still for Turkey, a defeat in Idlib could irreversibly damage its military presence elsewhere in northern Syria, which is viewed internally as a crucially important buffer protecting the homeland from Kurdish-led terrorist threats.For these reasons alone, Turkey and its political leadership have every interest to intervene to halt the regime advance. So far, Turkey has deployed more troops into Idlib than America has in all of Syria, along with countless tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, multiple-rocket launchers and surface-to-air missiles.As the largest standing army in NATO, Turkey has more than enough military capability to impose severe costs on Syrian regime forces and to coerce actors into, at minimum, ceasing fire. Yet in recent weeks, the Syrian regime has killed 15 Turkish soldiers and taken control of 13 of Turkey’s 31 military observation posts inside the greater Idlib region. Turkey’s most significant response so far has been to – directly or via its Syrian proxies – shoot down two Syrian helicopters with sophisticated surface-to-air missiles.On Thursday morning, for the first time, Turkish troops launched a ground offensive and recaptured a strategic village recently taken by the regime, but heavy Russian airstrikes forced them to withdraw just hours later.In other words, Turkey’s response thus far has been insufficient. But it is slowly escalating. Erdogan has issued a deadline for Syrian troops to withdraw by the end of February, so further and likely greater Turkish action is virtually guaranteed. The stakes involved for Turkey could not be higher and the next week will be crucial in determining what all of this means, for Syria, Russia, Turkey and indeed, for Europe too.Charles Lister is a

stories in its archives for a series of LGBT events as its curator suggests tales of homosexual relationships are more acceptable than Henry VIII\u0027s extreme heterosexuality.The charity, which looks after the Tower of London, Hampton Court, and Kensington Palace, is marking LGBT history month with tours about Royals and courtiers\u0027 same-sex relationships and drag queen story time.Experts argue that if the spousal brutality of Henry VIII can be taught in schools, then queer stories should have their place in British history The Tudor monarch has been accused of displaying “extreme heterosexuality” and “unbelievable misogyny” by Historic Royal Palaces curator Matthew Storey.“People are taught in school about Henry VIII and his six wives,” said curator Mr Storey in a promotional video for 2020 programme. “If that’s not an example of extreme heterosexuality and unbelievable mysogyny, I don’t know what is.“If you can talk about Henry VIII and his relationships, why not talk about romantic relationships between people of the same sex?”LGBT tours are planned for Henry VIII’s commandeered residence at Hampton Court, and drag queen story time sessions will take place at Kensington Palace.  At the Tower of London, where Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard met their end, the first ever “drag raven” has already been guiding visitors through lesser known queer tales for LGBT History Month. Historic Royal Palaces will highlight the lives of these figures and the more obscure characters in history throughout 2020, and experts have no compunction about exploring sexuality.Relationships highlighted by the programme include the rumoured romance between Edward II and nobleman Piers Gaveston, hinted at in 1995 film Braveheart, both of whom met a murderous end.  James I, survivor of Gunpowder Plot, also made favourites of men, while Queen Anne, played by Olivia Colman in The Favourite, bestowed her own favours on women.A courtier of Queen Mary II, Areballa Weir, was thought to be of “double gender” and her husband was actually a woman called Amy Poulter, who wore men’s clothing. These stories are thought to be more romantic than the six marriages of the portly King Henry, two of which ended in execution, and will be told at palatial sites this year.Mr Storey believes other historical figures could be welcomed into the LGBT fold, arguing evidence of sexual activity should not be the only test of intimacy, as very few people actually commit their conquests to history.“We can’t just look for sex,” he said.  “There is this feeling among historians that you can’t say someone is queer in the past unless you have clear evidence of them having sex with somebody of the same gender.  “How often when you have sex do you write it down on a piece of parchment?  We need to look for other evidence as well.” What evidence there was  of queer ancestry may have been destroyed be ashamed descendents clearing the family name.  A spokeswoman for Historic Royal Palaces said: “Historic Royal Palaces is committed to exploring the lives and experiences of LGBT+ figures linked to the magnificent buildings in our care. “To celebrate LGBT history month, we have launched a series of new tours offering a fresh perspective on the history of the palaces and shining a light on some of their forgotten love stories.”More from NewsMore

investigated actions northern ireland takes life","story":"The Government is under pressure to end the \u0027witch-hunt\u0027 against British veterans after a soldier who was being investigated over his actions in Northern Ireland took his own life.The veteran, named by friends as Eddie ‘Spud’ Murphy, was found dead by his wife last Thursday following an investigation into his service during the Troubles.Friends fear the pressure he felt at being investigated over historic allegations may have contributed to the tragedy.The Government has promised to protect veterans from prosecution, but there has been concern over the length of time being taken to introduce any measures to safeguard them.Six British Army veterans are currently facing the prospect of being prosecuted in the Northern Ireland courts.Mr Murphy is understood to have served with the 1st Battalion, Royal Highland Fusiliers, in Northern Ireland, where he survived at least one bomb attack by the IRA.A friend using the name Dukesy broke the news of his death on Twitter, saying: “My friend took his life today. He served in N.Ireland was blown up by the IRA and fortunate to survive.“More recently he was subject to the Historic inquiry witch hunt. He tried to take his life three times before, this time he succeeded. A victim of the IRA. RIP Spud.”A photograph thought to be of Mr Murphy, who came from a military family, was posted on social media showing him standing outside Redford Infantry Barracks in Edinburgh. Another showed him on duty in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, said he was aware of the veteran’s death and that the Government was working quickly to protect British soldiers from being dragged through the courts decades after serving their country.Mr Mercer wrote on Twitter: “I am aware of this, and my heart goes out to this inidual and his family.“This Prime Minister has promised legislation to end vexatious and repeated prosecution of veterans without new evidence. He tasked me to do it. By 18th March. And we will.”Ian Duncan Smith MP, who is chairman of the Parliamentary Veterans Support Group, told The : “I am deeply saddened to hear the news of his death. “Too many ex-servicemen face being caught up in this historic cases review. The government promised they would stop such investigation unless there is new, fresh compelling evidence. “Too often ex-servicemen feel as though having served their country they have now been thrown to the wolves by politicians. It’s shameful.”The Ministry of Defence would not comment on the death.News of the death comes after The  revealed that a veteran being prosecuted over the killing of a man during the Troubles is taking the Government to court to force ministers to make good the promise to protect former soldiers like him.Dennis Hutchings, who goes on trial next month for his alleged part in a fatal shooting in 1974, is seeking a judicial review of the Government\u0027s promise to protect elderly veterans from prosecution over their actions in Northern Ireland.Mr Hutchings, 78, has accused ministers of abandoning him and other veterans who risked their lives while on service in the Province.The former member of the Life Guards regiment has pleaded not guilty to the attempted murder of a man with learning difficulties during the conflict. John Pat Cunningham, 27, died after being shot in the back as he ran away from an Army patrol near Benburb, Co Tyrone.Mr Hutchings wants ministers to urgently introduce legislation to back up their pledge to protect veterans from what he calls vexatious legal action in Northern Ireland.Commenting on the suicide of a fellow veteran Mr Hutchings said: “It wouldn’t suprise me that this has happened. I know what all the stress of this feels like.”Mr Hutchings solicitor, Matthew Jury, of McCue \u0026amp Partners, added: “This death stresses the need for the Government to take urgent action. It is desperately sad and it’s not the first one.”Research shows British Army veterans are 54 times more likely to be prosecuted than former republican paramilitaries as a result of the Good Friday peace agreement. This saw controversial On the Run letters issued to paramilitaries, giving them amnesty from prosecution for crimes committed during the Troubles, between 1969 and 1998.For confidential support and advice, ring the Samaritans on 116 123 or visit www.samaritans.org.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/12/11/Rishi-Sunak.jpg","title":"budget surplus chancellor rishi sunak uk government","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.January\u0026nbspsurplus comes in at £9.8bn, lower than the consensus forecast of £11.4bnThe UK posted a smaller than expected\u0026nbspbudget\u0026nbspsurplus in January, a month that traditionally sees an inflow of tax revenues, according to figures that highlighted the challenge facing incoming chancellor Rishi Sunak.The surplus, excluding public sector-owned banks, stood at £9.8bn, down by £2.1bn\u0026nbspor 18 per cent\u0026nbspfrom January 2019, the Office for National Statistics\u0026nbspsaid. The consensus forecast was for an £11.4bn surplus.This meant that borrowing in the current financial year-to-date, covering April 2019 to January 2020, was £44.8bn –\u0026nbsp£5.8bn or 14.9 per cent more than in the same period the previous year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIf the trend continues over February and March, the full-year deficit will be around £45bn, according to analysts at Investec Bank. This would still be below the £47.6bn that the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast.An improvement in revenue thanks to a record £16.2bn collected through self-assessment was cancelled out by a 3.6 per cent annual increase in spending –\u0026nbspday-to-day rather than investment expenditure, reflecting increases in spending on health, social care and education pledged by former prime minister Theresa May.Budget to go ahead in March, new chancellor confirmsSpending by government departments rose by 6.5 per cent compared with a year earlier. Total spending, including capital investment, rose by 5.5 per cent. The current budget in the fiscal year so far was in deficit by £7.2bn.Under the fiscal rules set by former chancellor Sajid Javid, who resigned earlier this month, the government must balance the current budget over three years, although borrowing for infrastructure is allowed up 3 per cent of GDP, which would allow an extra £22bn of public sector net investment a year.“While the current fiscal rule, would still allow a large rise in public investment, the rise in the deficit makes the ambition of balancing the current budget deficit more restrictive,” said Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at analysts Capital Economics.Mr Sunak said this week he would stick with the 11 March date for the government’s first post-Brexit Budget, ending speculation that the plans, which are likely to entail a big increase in spending, would be delayed.Philip Shaw, the chief UK economist at Investec, said the critical factor for next month’s Budget would be how much fiscal headroom there was to raise spending further beyond the plan for 2020-21 that Mr Javid set out last September.“The Conservatives’ manifesto committed the party to balancing the current budget during this parliament,” he\u0026nbspsaid.Mr Shaw added\u0026nbspthat how much room Mr Sunak had depended on precisely how this was defined, for example, which specific year in the parliament was used.“Our guess is that although there will not be much space for fiscal generosity, the chancellor will find some,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But attempts to discover it turned up nothing, until the latest discovery.Now researchers say they have found signs of oxygen in a galaxy called\u0026nbspMarkarian 231, 560 million lightyears away. That galaxy lies in the constellation Ursa Major and was already notable because it contains a bright quasar, where gas is swirled around a black hole\u0026nbspand glows visibly through the universe.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs well as being the site of the first ever detection of breathable oxygen outside of our galaxy, Markarian 231 contains the most oxygen ever seen outside of our own solar system.Astronomers from China\u0027s Shanghai Astronomical Observatory were able to spot signs of oxygen using radio telescopes on Earth.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

That is the signal for O2 in its breathable form, leading researchers to that they had made the\u0026nbspfirst detection of extragalactic molecular oxygen, as they write in the paper published in the Astrophysical Journal.Nasa could find alien planets that host life after new breakthroughOxygen is so hard to see from Earth because many of the signals that would alert us to it are absorbed by Earth\u0027s atmosphere. The new discovery was possible in part because the light is redshifted as it travels through space, allowing it to be stretched out into a wavelength that could more easily get through the atmosphere.While the gas is present in\u0026nbspMarkarian 231 in the form that humans breathe, actually travelling there and breathing it would not be possible. The swirl of gases present in the atmosphere does not have the same makeup as it does on Earth, and those other gases are required to allow humans to breathe in oxygen.But the discovery offers an important way of tracking how O2 interacts with such extreme astrophysical areas, the scientists write, and further examination of the galaxy could allow us to learn about how oxygen is present through the rest of the cosmos.And it also suggests that we may be able to find more oxygen, elsewhere in the universe. New equipment could be used to find oxygen elsewhere in the universe, the scientists involved write.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All the power’s there. We\u0027ve moved the engine but we haven\u0027t moved the user interface framework. We’ve made sure to lift the metaphors that we really want to keep alive on the iPad.”The initial release of Photoshop for iPad was met with mixed reviews, to which Adobe responded with a blog post insisting that the company was listening and detailing some of the changes that were on the way.Photoshop mistake shows Australian PM with two left feetTo celebrate the thirtieth birthday, Adobe has just announced new features for the desktop version, such as improvements to lens blur effects, performance improvements to discover a “more buttery and seamless mouse experience.”For the iPad version, the new elements include type settings, which addresses earlier worries users had, and an object selection tool which was only released for the desktop version a few months ago. In other words, the iPad version is adding desktop features, and fast.\u0026nbspBack to Lamkin: what does he mean when he refers to metaphors?“Well, take something as fundamental to Photoshop as masking, he says.\u0026nbspTo mask a layer on the desktop product is something that you can approach in three or four different ways. Do we want to offer three or four different approaches on the iPad? I don\u0027t think so.The metaphor of layer masks is something that\u0027s really critical to compositing. How do we reveal that in a way that is appropriate for that device and appropriate for new classes of customers?”One way of keeping things simple for newcomers is the way Adobe progressively reveals functionality. “Sure, as opposed to having 12 different options show up in the menu bar, we express things in a way that\u0027s more appropriate for the device and the users who are going to come to that for the first time on the iPad.”Is that Photoshop newbie the customer who is Adobe’s main priority with iPad? Adobe has made a big focus on accessibility and on different programs working together, so is accessibility or integration more important?Lamkn pauses and says:\u0026nbsp“I\u0027d say our top two priorities are building a great multi-surface workflow for Photoshop customers and paying close attention to established Photoshop customers who want to add a touch device to their workflow, to be able to work anywhere, regardless of what device they\u0027re working on. But we also want to acquire new customers who are really primary to that device. We don’t want to make any horrendous trade-offs in our iPad implementation of the product.”It’s a journey, then, which is also a useful response to some of those initial reviews. “We\u0027ve chosen to really focus on enabling the key workflows and use cases that are the most compelling out of the gates and to add additional use cases as we go, as opposed to trying to boil the ocean and deliver everything all at once until we understand how people actually use it.”With something like Photoshop that’s been going for so long, creating that blank canvas must be quite a daunting part of the design with the new iPad version.Lamkin nods. “Oh, it’s a heavy lift. We\u0027ve been at we\u0027ve been at it for three-and-a-half years. A lot of experimentation with how much risk do we take in delivering a new experience at the risk of not fully satisfying the existing customer base. It\u0027s not something we took lightly and it\u0027s something that the team worked for a couple years to get to.”Finally,\u0026nbspLamkin talks about\u0026nbspthe person coming to Photoshop for the first time on the iPad. What would he want the first big takeaway from trying Photoshop on the iPad to be?“Approachability and delight,” he says. “It\u0027s like I open this up and within 10 minutes I’ve familiarized myself with the application and the language and how I need to approach it to get the most out of it and I\u0027m delighted by what I can do just out of the gate.I want users to after 10-15 minutes session have done something that they\u0027re proud of. I’m not saying that they\u0027re going to learn the whole application, but they’ll say, hey, I understand how layers work and I\u0027ve been able to do a composite and, boom, I got something magical I just created.Creativity should be light, there should be a lightheartedness in this application too.

The other is a cylindrical stone block thought to be the partial remains of an altar.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe recently excavated area “represents a place, which in history and in the Roman imagination, speaks about the cult of Romulus”, said archaeologist Patrizia Fortini.As the legend goes, Romulus and his twin Remus – born to the god of war and daughter of a neighbouring city’s deposed king – were ordered to be thrown into the Tiber river by the new king, but were instead abandoned by its banks and rescued by a wolf, who suckled them until they were found by a shepherd.Created with Sketch.Top ten passions of Ancient Rome Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photograph by Burc OzkanPhotograph by Burc OzkanAfter restoring their grandfather to the throne, they set out to build their own city, but a disagreement about which of Rome’s seven hills to build upon saw a rift appear between them.\u0026nbspRomulus claimed to have won via ine approval, building upon Palatine Hill and becoming the city’s first king circa 753 BC. Romulus later murdered his brother in a dispute.While Rome’s origin story is heavily disputed, some ancient sources claimed Romulus was buried in the area of the find. The sarcophagus likely dates to some 200 years after the twins’ time.Archaeologists accidentally break eggs going off for 1,700 yearsSecrets of ancient society revealed after stone found during roadworksAncient royal tombs more than 3,000 years old uncovered in GreeceIt is not known even whether Romulus physically existed” the way he was described in legends, Ms Fortini said, adding that nobody is hypothesising the sarcophagus ever actually contained Romulus’ remains.Alfonsina Russo, the archaeologist in charge of the site, noted that according to some ancient traditions Romulus was killed and chopped to pieces, or ascended into heaven.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another crucial clue for where to dig was the close proximity of a black marble shrine called the Lapis Niger.\u0026nbspOne of the oldest relics in the Forum, the Lapis Niger was long believed by some Romans to mark either Romulus’ grave, or the spot where some claimed he was murdered by the senate.While excavations continue, authorities hope the public will be able to stroll underground to view the discovery by 2022.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They are going to be single males travelling on their own. If you are travelling with a family of kids, on you go the chances you are going to blow them all up is zero.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“You can’t say stuff, because it’s racism, but it will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion. Thirty years ago it was the Irish. If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat.”The Muslim Council of Britain said in a statement: “These comments are openly racist.

Many studies have highlighted that Muslims in the UK, US and elsewhere already experience discriminatory treatment from airport security and police, and sometimes from fellow passengers.“We know from research that Muslims are often racially profiled at airports but it is the brazen nature of the comments by Michael O’Leary that are really disturbing. The comments are also really irresponsible when we consider that Muslims already suffer the majority of faith-based hate crime.“These comments will only help to encourage Islamophobia, and will do nothing at all to prevent terrorism,” he added.Mr O’Leary is no stranger to controversy, having previously said “shoot them” in reference to environmentalists and travel agents, and called obese people “monsters”.He also stirred anger nationwide after suggesting passengers should pay to use toilets on flights and even pushed proposals to remove two of the three lavatories on each plane so they could be replaced with seats.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They’re the ones who have the deepest sense of who they are, and what they value, and what they care about.”Mr Buttigieg then paid tribute to his husband Chasten, who was sat in the\u0026nbspfront row of the audience.Buttigieg mocks Trump for paying hush money to Stormy Daniels“And one of those people by the way, one of the strongest people I know, is my husband, Brad Pitt.”During his interview with Ms DeGeneres, Mr Buttigieg also questioned\u0026nbspto what extent Mr Trump meets the traditional definition of masculinity: “You know, when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan, Donald Trump was working on season seven\u0026nbspof Celebrity Apprentice.”As the Democratic presidental primary continues, Mr Buttigieg is still riding high from his strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, but has yet to rise towards the top of the national polls, in which Bernie Sanders still leads the other candidates by a significant margin.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Godfather 2 is the exception, not the rule. With their small budgets, bad actors, terrible scripts, sequels are often a disappointment. The issue is that they are so often the product of money-grabbing film execs, less concerned about making a good movie than trading off the success of the original.\u0026nbspWe would all be better off if studios focussed on making something new rather than trying to insert life back into what’s gone before. Let the detective stay dead, leave the couple at the wedding altar, let that airborne virus remain in remittance. Ignore the investor whispering in your ear: the monstrously big shark does not need to eat more tourist’s legs off.\u0026nbspPeople never learn. A sequel to romantic classic PS I Love You is currently in development. No, you won’t have to watch Hillary Swank lose her husband twice, nor does he come back from the dead. But you will have to endure more tragedy PS I Love You’s sequel will see Holly helping the terminally ill write to their loved ones.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPS No One Loves a Sequel. To prove it here is the most unnecessary examples on record.Click through the gallery below to see the list.Created with Sketch.The 27 worst film sequels of all time Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party. The makers of Weekend at Bernie’s 2 were probably asking themselves the same thing in 1993. This tired comedy never crosses over from stupid into funny, despite many of the cast returning to try and recapture the dubious magic.The sequel to Donnie Darko toys with the concept of time, by wasting yours. The dialogue is awful, the acting wooden, and you don’t even get to see an angsty black haired Jake Gyllenhaal in all his blue-eyed glory. Director of the original, Richard Kelly, was so offended by S. Darko he described the experience of watching it as “horribly violating”.Robert De Niro’s reputation continued to devalue with the third installment of the Meet The Parents series. The title indicates how much effort was put into this family comedy, which relies on under-the-belt hits to wring any laughs out of its audience.This follow-up to the flashy 2013 film squanders the only reason it would have a sequel, and somehow is not named Now You See Me Now. The sleight-of-hand magic here is all style and no substance, and the endless overcomplicated reveals of characters tricking each other become very irritating.Mulan is a gender-bending, brave heroine who refuses to conform to society\u0027s expectations of her. That is, until she reappears in the Disney sequel as a devoted wife who is more than willing to comply with her husbands demands. Now even her pet dragon Mushu doesn’t like her. 1627 Son of the MaskJim Carrey is replaced by Alan Cumming in this low-budget comedy sequel, which manages to be both frantic and boring at once. Director Lawrence Guterman tries to make up for the lack of Carrey’s signature comedic vim by adding a baby and a dog, but their antics can’t distract from the ugly production design.Danny and Sandy flying off into the sunset should have been the end of Grease. But money-hungry film execs brought us back to Rydell High for sequel fans were hopelessly undevoted to. I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was, said Sandy stand-in Michelle Pfieffer years later. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better.1827 Dumb and Dumber ToStupider even than its title, the Farrelly brothers’ sequel puts its stars (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels) through an overlong retread of past material. The broad humour feels decades out of date, and the energy that propelled the original through its juvenile jokes is gone. It’s hard to imagine who was the target audience for these gross-out sight gags.Hitchcock’s 1963 film The Birds was a masterclass in suspense. The birds that menace Tippi Hedron and the other inhabitants of Bodega Bay become genuinely disturbing through a slow, atmospheric build of tension. This made-for-TV sequel has the same avian threat, and some of the same cast, but none of the classic thrills.Sharon Stone had bad instincts when she agreed to this film. Even a new take on her iconic leg-crossing interrogation scene couldn’t save this sequel from one of the worst rotten tomato ratings on record. It managed to make less than $6m Stateside on a $70m budget.Amy Adams tries her best to tear into her role as a sadistic, sex-obsessed bully but the script for Cruel Intentions 2 – strictly speaking, a prequel, but sssh – is so bad that even she failed to save it. When her stepbrother Sebastian moves into her Mum’s Manhattan mansion, she barges into his shower and warns him, no one is going to threaten my cushy life. What teenager would ever say cushy life? Did a Mean Girls sequel happen if Tina Fey wasn’t around to write it? No, no it did not. A Plastics vs nerds turf war in the pits of the high school jungle just doesn’t work without Fey’s tight one-liners. In Mean Girls 2 we hear none of the “on Wednesdays we wear pink” “that\u0027s why her hair is so big. It\u0027s full of secrets” “you can’t sit with us” zingers that made the original film so magical. Although the soundtrack had its fans, this film is essentially a remake of the 1980 original without one half of the titular Blues Brothers (John Belushi died in 1982). Bafflingly, he is replaced by a 10-year old child in sunglasses. It’s half as funny and nowhere near as infectiously fun, but if you only care about the music, that might not matter.Infamous for ruining what would have been, in many critics’ eyes, a perfect trio of movies, The Godfather Part III delivers a slow anti-climax. The film has its defenders, but given the calibre of the first two Godfathers, this last instalment is the black sheep of the family.A young Hilary Swank stars in the fourth Karate Kid film, a precursor to the modern trend of rebooting ailing franchises with a female lead. Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi is charming as always, but the script is mostly recycled. There are a couple of interesting differences: Swank has a pet hawk, Buddhist monks dance to the Cranberries, and there’s almost no fighting. But what’s a Karate Kid sequel without the Kid or the karate?It might be called Staying Alive, but you won’t want to after watching this sequel. Six years after our hero Tony Manero made white polyester bell bottoms popular, we check back in on him as he auditions for a new Broadway musical called Satan’s Alley. There are far too many romantic subplots, oiled up chests and loincloths to make this film okay. Keanu Reeves wisely didn’t pick up the phone for this Razzie-winning action thriller. The speeding bus rigged by a bomber in the 1994 film is bizarrely replaced by a cruise ship here, making the action a lot slower and more boring. Poor Sandra Bullock is given nothing interesting to do, and surely must have been tempted to look for a lifeboat. Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film.

They are simply stunning.It’s no wonder that the Greeks want them to be ed to Athens while we want to keep them.They are on display for free in the British Museum, and I would urge you to pay them a visit.You cannot help but be moved by the amazing level of craftsmanship and imagination embodied in them.The outstanding sculptures depict, in expressive detail, rippling muscles, bulging veins, fluttering robes, the flaring nostrils of horses and the upward swing of a bull’s head in a flowing, dynamic composition that reveals the extraordinary skill of their creators.They have inspired artists in their depiction of the human and animal form since they were rediscovered in the th Century.To have them here in Britain, in the care of the British Museum since , is an enormous privilege, never to be taken for granted.We are lucky that Lord Elgin found them and made a deal with the local Ottoman rulers at the time to bring so many of them back to the UK in the early s.At the time, the Parthenon was no longer the awe-inspiring temple it had been.In fact, it had been badly damaged in an explosion in , and when Lord Elgin took them, many of the marbles were little more than rubble.Since being housed in the British Museum, among other stunning treasures from the ancient world, public understanding of their signicance has grown.They continue to inspire anyone who sees them with a sense of what human beings can achieve in the application of knowledge, imagination and skill.At the British Museum, which is legally obliged to care for them in perpetuity, they can be visited and studied by adults, children and young people from all over the country.Not all of us will be lucky enough to travel to Greece in our letime but your mind can wander there by seeing the Elgin Marbles in London.And it is important that our kids continue to do this, because it opens up the history of the world and art.It is not just Brits either. London is one of the most accessible cities in the world, easy to reach from across Europe and where.People from around the globe visit the museum and learn what we share in common, and how humans have interpreted the world through their artefacts.We should resist the claim that artefacts belong where they were made, not least because it denies historical truth.Throughout history, artefacts have been traded across the world, often to the benefit of the people who created them, sometimes to their detriment. History is complicated and often not to our liking.The Parthenon was built long before modern Greece existed — when the region was made up of warring cities ided by arid mountains.Those who built the Parthenon had no notion of nationhood. Their concern at the time would have been to show off their city.How proud they would have beenthey could have foreseen the reverence with which their creations are held today around the world.The fact that the DNA of their descendants is now likely to have spread worldwide only reinforces the point that the geographical origin of the Marbles carries little objective signicance.Giving in to repatriation demands will undo the real achievements of cultural history in showing that more unites us than ides us. The amazing thing about the flowering of knowledge about the world in the th and th Centuries was that it created an awareness of human potential — a sense of what we could achieve in the arts and sciences.The Marbles symbolise this achievement — they opened up horizons and revealed new possibilities for human thought and action.Maintaining this sense of openness remains as important now as ever.In today’s globalised world, it’s tempting to think that people can see anything via the internet,not physically.But we must fiercely guard our museum collections, which remain the most accessible way for properly engaging with history.The Government is right to refuse to include the Elgin Marbles in any deals with the EU.They should never be used as political capital to serve the interests of European elites.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is cheaper to buy, but contains moisture and when burned gives off more smoke and pollution than dry wood.It is also harder to set alight, and dficult to burn.Burning wet wood can also lead to a build-up of soot and sticky creosote inside of the burner.Dry wood has usually been dried out in a kiln and has a moisture content of % or less.If you are chopping your own wood to burn, it will need to be dried out for around a year in order to be classied as dry. Some types of wood, such as oak, will require longer.Pieces of wet wood will make a dull thud when knocked together, while you can spot dry wood by looking for cracks, a dull colour and loose bark.

It would boost the Government’s green credentials ahead of the UN climate change conference in the summer.Many in the so-called ‘Red Wall’ seats are said to be signing the letter, which will warn the PM that ending the fuel duty freeze after a decade would damage the Tories in the crucial seats they must keep to stay in power.If more than  Tory MPs in those areas sign the letter they would have the numbers to defeat the PM in the Commons as he has an -seat majority.Fuel duty was frozen thanks to The Sun’s long-running Keep it Down campaign.Analysis earlier this week showed how people in those seats — in the Midlands and the North — are far more reliant on their car than those in the south.And an RAC study found more than a third of drivers — the equivalent of . million drivers — depend more on using their car than  months ago.Tory MP Jack Lopresti said the Government must listen and deliver for voters who rely on their car as the only means of transport.He said: “Hiking fuel duty would particularly hit people who voted Tory for the first time.“We all believe that we need to put signicant investment in public transport infrastructure but until that happens we should not be considering raising duty.”The letter to Mr Sunak will be sent next week when MPs are back from their half-term break.The UK has the highest fuel duty in the world —charged at p per litre of diesel and petrol.This is more than twice as much as Australian, which charges p per litre.Even Germany has a lower rate than the UK, at p per litre for diesel and p for petrol.The US state with the highest rate of fuel duty is Calornia, which charges p per litre for petrol and p for petrol.Howard Cox, founder of the FairFuelUK campaign, said: “We’ve been warned that evenit doesn’t happen this year it is back on the agenda and we need to start lobbying again.And because Brits are eco-conscious already, none of these moves is remotely necessary. Over a third of us have installed a smart meter to monitor energy usage, and four-fths are making an effort to save energy at home.The Government is welcome to give us tempting incentives to stay green.But bossy bans and taxes must end now.“We don’t just want them to continue with the freeze but to cut petrol duty. We are not against clean air — all our members want that but taxes and bans are not the way of achieving that.”During the election, the PM told The Sun he had “absolutely no intention” of raising fuel duty.But the pledge was left out of the Tory manesto, raising fears the Treasury could hike the duty.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is already clear the UK and the EU are MILES APART on how any deal would work — and moving further away from each other.Brussels insists this country signs up to stringent rules on a “level playing field” and governance before the talks can proceed. This means they want the UK to agree to stick to a bunch of EU rules even after we have left.At the same time, they want a structure where the EU’s own institutions have a key role in decidingthe UK is doing this or not.The EU view is that the UK will ultimately agree to these demands because the EU is so much bigger.One figure on the European side dismisses the idea that the UK and the EU are “sovereign equals”, pointing out that the EU has a population of million to our million.They think economic reality and the threat of long queues of lorries at Dover will lead to the UK backing down.But the Government is not going to do that. It thinks agreeing to these restrictions would destroy the whole point of Brexit: Our ability to do things dferently.Boris Johnson has been praising chief negotiator David Frost’s speech making this point as “magnicent” to anyone who’ll listen.If the EU insists on these preconditions in the opening round of negotiations, scheduled for the first week of March, the Government will dismiss the talks as pointless.Inside No, they believe Brussels does not realise how much has changed since the General Election.One source tells me: “The EU, understandably, are treating this negotiation like the previous one. But our hand is much stronger because of the mandate we’ve been given by voters.”Downing Street hopes Frost’s speech this week will make the European side realise we are serious about not accepting EU preconditions.One insider points out that Boris Johnson needn’t have an election until  — so nearly every European leader would pay the price at the ballot box before he does for any economic disruption caused by the failure of negotiations.When I asked one Secretary of State why the Government was so adamant that everything had to be settled by the end of this year, I was told: “If there are hiccups, it is better for them to happen in Year One of a government, not Year Three.”It is not just on the future relationship that the UK and EU are heading for a row.A figure close to the negotiations says they are “starting to wake up in Brussels to the fact we have a totally dferent interpretation of the Irish protocol”, which covers arrangements for the Irish border.The appointments of Suella Braverman as Attorney-General and Brandon Lewis as Northern Ireland Secretary indicates the Government is preparing to take a robust approach.This will infuriate the EU side, which believes these arrangements have already been agreed.Interestingly, influential figures on both sides hope the blow-up in trade talks comes SOONER rather than later.Why  Because they think it is only once the two sides have realised just how far apart they really are that the serious negotiations can begin.DOWNING Street is acutely aware that one of the biggest dangers to this government is LOSING VOTERS’ TRUST.If people come to see this administration as just another bunch of politicians who don’t do what they said they would, then it is doomed.No also knows that Boris Johnson’s opponents love to attack him as “untrustworthy”.This didn’t hurt him too much at the election because voters regard most politicians as untrustworthy.Butthere was a clear and compelling example of him breaking his word to voters then that could change, and very quickly.This explains why the promises made in the Tory manesto are being treated as holy writ in government.There is a serious point to Boris’s cringe-making call and response with Cabinet ministers about how they are going to hire , more police officers.He knows they need to do this to show a sceptical electorate that he keeps his promises.During the campaign, he admitted that the questions about whether he keeps his word made his “blood boil”.The whole emphasis on promise-keeping is bad news for Heathrow and the third runway.In , Boris promised to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop it being built. Sothe bulldozers move in on his watch it will be acutely embarrassing.You can just imagine the split screen of his comments and the ground being flattened – it would dramatise the whole trust issue.This is one of the reasons why I think the third runway won’t end up happening.If in the next few weeks the Mayor of London wins his judicial review against the decision to go ahead with it, I doubt the Government will appeal the verdict.But Patel is not the first Home Secretary to have dficult relations with him.Allies of Amber Rudd believed that Rutnam should have gone when she quit over the handling of the Windrush scandal, which was as much an institutional failure as a political one.Friends of hers believe one of the reasons why the review into it has yet to be published is that it makes clear that the institutional Home Office is to blame for what went wrong.The ministers keep changing but the Home Office has not been “fit for purpose” for some time.It is proof that effective government is going to require reform of Whitehall.I understand Trump spontaneously raises the issue with social confidants, as well as figures inside his administration. He complains about the “betrayal” it represents.It isn’t just Trump who is cross. A host of Tory MPs are still pushing No to give an indication as to when the  per cent cap on Huawei involvement in the G network will be reduced to zero.The question is whether Boris will have done anything to address these concerns before he heads to the US for the G summit and a meeting with Trump in JuneThe contest hasn’t captured the public’s imagination and it has mostly served as a reminder of how in hock Labour still is to Corbynite ideology.None of the three remaining candidates is proposing the kind of break from the Corbyn years that is needed.Until it can break these shackles, Labour won’t be a national party again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This surely has consequences. You really wonder, whose advice have they been taking.What they said: The preference of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex was to continue to represent and support Her Majesty The Queen albeit in a more limited capacity, while not drawing on the Sovereign Grant.What they mean: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were widely believed to want a half-in, half-out deal that allowed them to work as royals without being senior members in the Family.Mr Fitzwilliams said this part of the statement reaffirmed this - but pointed out their hopes were not practical.He said: Who would be the arbiter of whether their activities in achieving financial self sufficiency were appropriate  Whatthey were tacky What was unprecedented and inappropriate was the way they released the statement saying what they wanted without telling the Queen and senior royals first.The Sovereign Grant only pays for  per cent of their income so it isn’t that substantial.What they said: It is agreed that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son. This is based on The Duke’s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military service, the Duchess’ own independent profile, and the shared threat and risk level documented specically over the last few years. No further details can be shared as this is classied information for safety reasons.What they mean: Scotland Yard officers protecting Meghan Markle and Prince Harry recently were reported to be concerned over running errands at their new Canada base.Experts have estimated the annual bill for protecting Harry and Meghan at £ million to £ million.Mr Fitzwilliams said: They will obviously continue to received the security they need for these reasons. The taxpayers in the U.K. and Canada might not like it however.Polls show the vast majority do not approve of it in the UK and in Canada and many feel the Sussexes have handled their affairs extremely selfishly.What they said: The Royal Family respect and understand the wish of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex to live a more independent le as a family, by removing the supposed ‘public interest’ justication for media intrusion into their lives. They remain a valued part of Her Majesty’s family.What they mean: Mr Fitzwilliams explained that Meghan and Harry were hammering home the point they wanted to choose what they do and dont do.And he pointed out the birth of their son Archie may have elevated the couples concerns.Recently, Harrys pal Nacho Figueras said the prince just wanted to protect his son.Mr Fitzwilliams said: They want to choose what they do and what they don’t do and, which caused problems after Archie was born, what is private and what is not.How Archie grows up for example and where. Now they obviously can but not as working members of the royal family and not using their titles.What they said: It was agreed that The Duke and Duchess will no longer be able to formally carry out ‘official duties’ for The Queen or represent The Commonwealth, but they will, however, be allowed to maintain their patronages .What they mean: Mr Fitzwilliams today pointed out that much of the statement released last night was unnecessary and sounded bitter.He said: Since they are closing their office at Buckingham Palace and sacking their staff how will they cope with handling their patronages They will apparently not be starting a foundation but a non-profit entity to effect change. They have their cause driven work which they are indeed committed to.And he pointed out the Queen had kept the door open for a  month review in case the couple had a change of heart.He said: It should be remembered when they announced in January they were stepping back as senior royals in a surprise, unprecedented statement they said they intended to “collaborate” with Her Majesty The Queen.It’s a very odd phrase to use, surely serve would have been more appropriate and shown some humility.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Air travel is set to fall for the first time in a decade.Experts say there is now a risk the virus could wipe out up to five per cent of the world’s gross domestic product – equivalent to £trillion – and tip the world into a recession.We examine the threat to our everyday lives from the coronavirus . . .AS millions of soccer fansto stadiums after the winter break, clubs are frantically installing extra hand sanitisers and putting up posters warning supporters to go home and self-isolatethey have coronavirus symptoms.Medical staff at grounds have also had training in what to dothey fear a fan has fallen ill.A Crystal Palace spokesman told The Sun on Sunday: “We have installed hand sanitisers in every toilet at the ground, and signs around the staduim will remind supporters to wash their hands.”Brighton and Leicester City told us they were stepping up hygiene safety too, while fans arriving at Manchester United and Arsenal tomorrow and Liverpool Monday are likely to find extra measures in place as well.Sources told us many clubs are “fearful” about the impact the virus could have.One said: “Tens of thousands of people congregate at stadiums. And with so many fixtures over the next few weeks, all clubs fear a carrier of the virus turning up to a match and passing it on.“That’s why so many clubs are working to protect fans the best they can.”SHOP workers are so terried of catching the virus they are asking bossesthey should be wearing masks – but nobody seems to know the answer.Andrew Opie, of the British Retail Consortium, said: “We are fielding calls from retailers wanting to know what advice they should be giving staff.“We’re calling on the Government to produce more guidance. We need specic advice businesses can refer to.”The crisis is also set to spread to the shelves. Half of Primark’s clothes come from China, as do  per cent of Next’s, but for weeks many of the clothes factories have been closed.A string of brands have already closed stores in China due to the virus, including Nike, Adidas, Puma and Ralph Lauren.Cosmetic giants L’Oreal and Estee Lauder, which produce millions of items in China, have also announced a massive fall in Chinese revenue.Retail experts fear this will push down profits for these firms and force many to raise prices later in the year, especially in the run-up to the busy summer season.Danone, which sells millions of bottles of mineral water and its Actimel range here, has a factory in Wuhan, so supplies may also be hit.DENTISTS have told how a shortage of Chinese-made face masks has led to suppliers tripling their prices.Today some websites were selling masks which previously cost about p each for more than £. The British Dental Association warned that supplies could run out by the middle of next week.But this may just be the tip of the iceberg. Pharmaceutical companies have been told by the Government to keep hold of stockpiles of urgent medicines which they amassed during the No-Deal Brexit preparations.Ministers fear restrictions by the Chinese government on air and rail travel could hit global supply chains and have asked firms to carry out a risk assessment on whether coronavirus will affect supplies.The impact is huge as China is a major supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs. These are the raw materials which go into medications which are used by tens of millions of us every day.Umang Vohra, of Indian multinational drug firm Cipla, said: “If this extends beyond February I think we’d see some panic buying, pushing up prices.”GLOBAL air travel is set to fall for the first time in a decade due to fears of the virus.Flight cancellations to places where the outbreak is re will bring a . per cent fall in ticket sales worldwide, costing the industry £.billion.This week British Airways extended its flight cancellations to and from China to April , having previously cancelled flights up to April .Travel agents have hit out at airlines for not simplying flight alterations during the crisis.Cruise lines have amended or cancelled itineraries to avoid countries in Asia where travel restrictions are in place.But agents who have packaged cruises with flights to Asian destinations other than mainland China have run into problems with airlines as they have tried to fly customers to or from the ports they sail from.The Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to mainland China but not to countries such as Singapore or Vietnam, so airlines still fly there.Alexandre de Juniac, director general of travel trade union Iata, said  would be “a very tough year”.He added: “These are challenging times for the global transport industry. Stopping the spread of the virus is a top priority.”CORONAVIRUS has put the brakes on car production in China in the past fortnight – and that is likely to be bad news for British motorists.The China-UK car market is worth around £billion a year and Honda, Peugeot and General Motors all have factories in Wuhan, which have been closed for a fortnight.VW, BMW, Toyota and French car parts firm Valeo have also been forced to shut plants in other parts of China.Jaguar Land Rover is already flying parts into Britain in suitcases as the virus hits its normal supply chain.Brits driving electric cars face higher pricesthey need to replace their batteries.German car parts firm Bosch, which relies on China for the items, is already reporting production shortages.Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner said: “If the situation continues, supply chains will be disrupted.”PARENTS who are hoping to get the latest toys as presents for their children could face tearful tantrums due to the virus.The maker of the massively popular LOL doll range – which is set to be this year’s must-have Christmas toy – is already reporting shortages.And even though it’s only February, the boss of the LA-based firm, Isaac Larian, has warned it is likely to have an impact come December .He said: “It’s a big mess and very frustrating. All toy companies begin production for winter products right after New Year. I just got a call saying some of our factories won’t be open until March. These are toys for Christmas.“We now have to manage how to reallocate the supply, not just in the US but the world.”Hasbro, which produces all the toys based on Disney’s Frozen  and the Star Wars franchise, has already warned of disruption to production.John Baulch, of Toy World ­magazine, said: “For those who thought it would be fixed in a matter of weeks, that ­outcome is looking increasingly unlikely.”GADGET fans face a shortage of the latest productsthe virus spreads further.Taiwanese firm Foxconn, which makes Apple’s iPhones and AirPods, has closed its largest factory in China, where a million phones a week are made, so the firm faces losing tens of millions of pounds of revenue.The virus is having a huge impact on production of the new iPhone .Apple has stopped its staff travelling to China to approve the engineering of the new model, a stage that is vital before allowing production to start.Manufacture usually begins in June, allowing Apple to release the handsets by September, so unless it gets engineers there soon it will miss that window.The phones are still likely to be made but there will be a big shortage, so prices could go up.Japan has already reported a shortage of Nintendo Switch consoles and games, and the long-awaited new X Box Series X console, and the PlayStation  are both being produced in China.Shops had hoped to have them in stock by autumn in time for Christmas.Any shortage is likely to lead to stores raising prices. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

jumping into a swimming pool from a hotel balcony and a ban on pub crawls and drink offers such as happy hours and two for ones.But the new regulations have caused controversy with the British Association of Travel Agentsslamming the changes as misdirected.The ABTA is asking the Balearic Government to think again about this element of the campaign.A statement on their website reads: The Balearic Islands and the destinations of Magaluf and San Antonio are very popular with British holidaymakers.While we strongly support initiatives that improve the health and safety of holidaymakers, as well as the welfare of local communities, such as encouraging bar owners to take a more responsible approach to the sale of alcohol and campaigning for balcony safety among young holidaymakers, we believe some of the measures announced in relation to addressing unsociable behaviour, for example targeting all-inclusive holidays, are misdirected.The vast majority of holidaymakers on all-inclusives are couples and families, so it is dficult to see how imposing strict rules on this type of arrangement will fix the problem of anti-social behaviour in resort.We would encourage the Balearic authorities to reconsider this.The ABTA noted that the limits on drinks does not apply to all-inclusive holidays that have already been booked in these resorts.Neither does the six-a-day limit apply to any of the all-inclusive hotels outside of Arenal, Magaluf and San Antonio.Hotel owners are said to be worried and claim tourists are already shunning their establishments and opting for those outside the zones.The new regulations will be valid for five years, with breaches leading to a penalty-based-system of fines of up to €, and suspension of activity for up to three years.Contracts already signed between tour operators and hoteliers will be respected to prevent any legal or contractual issues.A spokesperson for the Balearic Government said: The Balearic Islands government has approved a Decree Law to combat alcohol excess in certain tourist areas, with the aim of forcing real change in the tourism model of these destinations promoting responsible conduct, adopting measures to protect the destination and avoiding issues derived from excessive alcohol consumption in certain places of the Balearic Islands.This is the first standard adopted throughout Europe, which restricts the promotion and sale of alcohol in certain tourist areas.This new law aims to position the Balearic Islands as a pioneer destination in combating excesses in tourism with a standard that meets the Sustainable Development Goalsand the  Balearic Agenda.The law aims to create a more sustainable and respectful tourism model, in terms of the environment, the quality of le for residents and the visitor experience.The creation of this new bill is in the public interest and has come about following extensive dialogue.In recent times, efforts to positively promote the destination, create a better quality experience - via both public and private investments - and position the destination in an increasingly competitive and global market have been negatively impacted due to issues of unsociable behaviour often related to alcohol abuse in certain tourist areas of Mallorca and Ibiza.With this new law defended and requested by institutions, social enterprises, businesses and employers, the government provides the necessary tools to combat the issue and reverse any negative impact.Hotels are also being given the authority to immediately throw out unruly guests.Recently, a ban was put on booze cruises and pub crawls in Magaluf and tougher on-the-spot penalties, with fines for anti-social behaviour soared by at least four times.Calvià council, which covers all the main tourist hotspots in and around Magaluf, published a revised list of existing sanctions which were increased in price.One of the main objectives was to tackle drinking in the street and bottle parties, one of the most common problems during the tourist season."},{"url":null,"title":"history fans saucy nicknames","story":"Author Kate Lister was writing a book on sex in olden days when she came across Clarice.And the lecturer, , then vowed to come up with similar monikers for anyone who helped fund her work.It has seen Twitter users christened Colonel Nimble­wrist, Lord Dickie Rapscallion Dong III and Queenie Lickspittle of Pudding Lane.More than , helped crowdfund Kate’s book A Curious History of Sex, out this week.

They are furious after a public footpath at the multi-million pound riverside development gave way in last week’s storms, leaving a crater ft deep and ft long. It’s the latest in a series of alleged defects faced by buyers of Persimmon homes across the UK. Persimmon, one of the UK’s biggest housebuilders, has been under fire for years over its “poor quality” homes - even as it awarded bumper bonuses to bosses. Former chief executive Jeff Fairburn, , was ousted in December  following a backlash over his £million bonus that had been inflated by the Government’s Help to Buy loan scheme. His successor David Jenkinson, , was paid £million in . Carpet fitter Barry Nuckley, , and his we Ruth, , say they’ve spent £, of their own cash putting problems right at their £, four bedroom home next to the River Dearne near Huddersfield, West Yorks. Persimmon built the riverside footpath as part of landscaping work to protect nearby homes from flooding when they put up the Oxley Park estate in . Dad of one Barry says his worst fears were realised when a gaping hole appeared in the footpath as mud beneath it was swept away by storms Ciara and Dennis.   He said: “A woman knocked on the door and say she’d fallen down a footpath next to the house. The next morning we could see the devastation. It had washed away the soil underneath the footpath and created a void.  “Had she fallen down completely, she would have been dead. There’s no way she’d have got out of the river because it was so high.”   Neighbour Brian Cartwright, , says they had already alerted Persimmon to potential problems with the riverbank and it had promised to act. The retired painter and decorator said: “Persimmon have known about the problems since we lived here. They’ve been negligent from the start. “They promised to come and repair it and nothing happened. We don’t want to be clobbered with a bill for something we’are not responsible for.”  The row comes just days before Persimmon is due to announce it made more than £billion in profits last year.   Around half of its homes are sold through the Help to Buy scheme which has been criticised for boosting profits for builders while lting house prices further out of reach for young buyers. Latest government figures show more than £.billion of taxpayer-backed loans has been used to buy , Persimmon homes since the scheme was launched in .  In December, an independent review of its operations commissioned by Persimmon criticised the firm for having a corporate culture that resulted in “poor workmanship” and “potentially unsafe” homes. Persimmon says maintenance of the footpath has been handed over to a management company set up to run the estate.

The tragedies plunged Kellis into a “waking nightmare” and she thought about suicide. “I lost my whole worlds in the space of a few days,” she said. “When Casey died I felt like half of me was gone. She was my best friend and other half. We were almost the same person. “When I heard mum had died, I collapsed on the floor. Everything hurt.

But I couldn’t leave the rest of my family the way they had left me. I knew I needed to carry on and grow stronger. “So I put all my effort into work and qualying as a hairdresser – and I went out of my way to warn people of the dangers of drink driving so no one  goes through the hell I’ve been through.  “I’m doing really well now but I miss my mum and sister every day.” Kellis describes her sister as “fun loving, caring and the le and soul of the party”. She adds: “She had so much le and was such a brilliant person to be around.She ­always checked everyone  was all right and was so caring.She loved kids and really wanted a family of her own. She looked forward to that.  “From birth we were as thick as thieves.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have further raised tensions with the Queen after being forced to abandon plans to market themselves as “Royal”.In a move described as ­“extraordinary” and “petulant”, the couple published complaints on their Sussex Royal website, which will have to be redesigned within weeks. They questioned the power of the Queen and the Government, saying there is no legal case to stop them trading on the royal name abroad. The statement read: “While there isn’t any jurisdiction by The Monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word ‘Royal’ overseas, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use ‘Sussex Royal’ or any iteration of the word ‘Royal’ in any territorywhen the transition occurs in Spring .” The couple suggested they were being treated unfairly after the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William agreed to allow them to leave The Firm. As big banks and corporations queue up to work with them, they have been told to prove they can make it work while not profiting off the royal brand. In what is also being seen as a “highly inflammatory” move, Harry and Meghan ­insisted they will ­continue to receive taxpayer-funded security despite no deal being reached between the UK and Canada, where they are currently living with son Archie.  The statement read: “While there is precedent for other titled members of the Royal Family to seek employment outside of the ­institution, for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a -month ­review period has been put in place.” A royal source said: “It’s pretty clear they are referencing minor royals such as Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, which is an odd association to make for two people whose associates were once claiming they had single-­handedly modernised the monarchy.” On security, they suggested they would demand round-the-clock protection paid for by the public, owing to, “The Duke’s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military ­service, the Duchess’ own independent profile, and the shared threat”.  A royal source said: “We’re witnessing a quite extraordinary turn of events. “The British people will not stand for two ­multi-millionaires demanding taxpayer funds after abandoning the country they should be serving. “The latest series of comments published on the Sussexes’ website comes across as ­extremely petulant and has caused a great deal of alarm inside the palace.“This is further evidence of Harry and Meghan further ostracising ­themselves from the family ratherthan building bridges.”Harry and Meghan defied the Queen on January  by releasing a statement on Instagram announcing they were to “step back” as senior members of the royal family. They intended to move to North America and trade on their royal ­connections to make money in thecorporate world, while setting up a charitable vehicle and ­carrying out small roles for the Queen – but they were told there could be no “halfway house”.The couple have spent thousands trademarking Sussex Royal items and marketing their website and Instagram page.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs underlying tensions with the palace have been laid bare in their latest bombshell statement. It comes after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed they will stop using the word royal throughout their branding after they step back from royal duties next month. In an extraordinary statement released on Friday, Prince Harry and Meghan hinted at the tense negotiations as they detailed the revised role they will be taking on in the next year. They also appear to complain about not being allowed to seek outside employment while remaining working members of the family, as is the case for some other titled members of the firm. The couple will no longer carry out royal duties as of March , although they will still receive police protection because of Harryaposs military service and Meghanaposs independent profile. They also said they no longer plan to launch their own foundation and have abandoned plans to trademark Sussex Royal, as per the Queenaposs request. Reports in the US suggested Meghan had told pals there was aposnothing legally stopping themapos from using Sussex Royal despite the Queenaposs ban. The Queen called on her senior legal advisers to outline the case enshrined in UK law banning the use of the word “royal” for financial gain, prompting their latest bombshell statement. It means they cannot use Sussex Royal on merchandising, despite having already spent thousands on doing just that on a range of goods from T-shirts to bandanas and literature. They will also have to choose a new name for their planned charitable foundation, which was due to use the label. But in their new statement, the couple claim the Monarchy and Cabinet Office had no jurisdiction over the use of the word aposroyalapos overseas. However, the Sussexes said they no longer plan to trademark aposSussex Royalapos. The statement, published on their official website sussexroyal, reads:It is agreed that the commencement of the revised role of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will take effect Spring  and undergo a  month review. The Royal Family respect and understand the wish of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex to live a more independent le as a family, by removing the supposed ‘public interest’ justication for media intrusion into their lives. They remain a valued part of Her Majesty’s family.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will become privately funded members of The Royal Family with permission to earn their own income and the ability to pursue their own private charitable interests. The preference of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex was to continue to represent and support Her Majesty The Queen albeit in a more limited capacity, while not drawing on the Sovereign Grant.  While there is precedent for other titled members of the Royal Family to seek employment outside of the institution, for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a -month review period has been put in place.  Per the agreement The Duke and Duchess of Sussex understand that they are required to step back from Royal duties and not undertake representative duties on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen. As agreed and set out in January, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will retain their HRH prefix, thereby formally remaining known as His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex and Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will no longer actively use their HRH titles as they will no longer be working members of the family as of Spring . As the grandson of Her Majesty and second son of The Prince of Wales, Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex remains sixth in line to the throne of The British Monarchy and the Order of Precedence is unchanged. It was agreed that The Duke and Duchess will no longer be able to formally carry out ‘official duties’ for The Queen or represent The Commonwealth, but they will, however, be allowed to maintain their patronages . It is agreed that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son. This is based on The Duke’s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military service, the Duchess’ own independent profile, and the shared threat and risk level documented specically over the last few years.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe BBC’s take on Agatha Christie’s Pale Horse reached its chilling climax last week. But while viewers were gripped, it inspired one superfan to carry out his own deadly plan more than  years ago. Twisted genius George Trepal almost got away with the “perfect crime” after spiking his neighbours’ Coca-Cola with ­thallium – the tasteless, colourless, odourless poison used in the whodunnit. Mensa member Trepal, who organised murder mystery weekends, killed -year-old waitress Peggy Carr and ­poisoned four members of her family. Following the BBC’s shocking finale, starring Rufus Sewell and Bertie Carvel, Peggy’s son Duane Dubberly has opened up about his family’s terrying ordeal. The electrician, who spent months in hospital after the poisoning, said Trepal was a “psycho genius” who killed for the thrill. “This guy has destroyed so many lives,” he said. “He took away my mother. She died a terrible death. Iremember her being so ill, I had to carry her in my arms to hospital. “Trepal poisoned my other relatives too and put me in hospital for ten agonising months. I thought I was going to die, and I went through a living hell.”Peggy first started experiencing a ­tingling feeling in her limbs, followed by nausea and ­tightness in her chest. Then her hair started falling out. She spent the final four months of her le in agony as a mystery illness ravaged her body from the ­inside out.  Her family only learned the truth two years later – that Trepal had sneaked into their house with murder in mind. Duane, now , said: “It was chilling to learn Trepal had come into our home with an eight-pack of Coca-Cola spiked with poison because he wanted to kill us all.  “I just wish I knew why he chose to do it. We have never understood why.

Shocking images show hounds chasing down a terried muntjac deer across open land before cornering it against a barbed wire fence. The ordeal lasted almost  minutes before organisers dragged off the dogs. Comic Ricky, , said: “I will never understand the joy in chasing a terried animal for miles and then watching a pack of dogs rip it to death. “These people should be prosecuted and made to seek psychological help. This has no place in a civilised world.” His outrage at the Waveney Harriers hunt in Suffolk was echoed by actor Peter Egan. Peter, , said: “What message is sent when dogs disembowel a defenceless deer ” The hunt, which began as a legal “trail” using only animal scent with no kill, turned bloody when the hounds spotted the deer. It took place last Tuesday on the th anniversary of the law banning hunting with dogs.  It is illegal for animals to be pursued but witnesses claim the horse-mounted hunters did nothing to prevent the savagery. Retired Margaret Langham, , from Geldeston in Suffolk, said: “The poor thing went straight into a fence. There is no way it can have survived.” But the Waveney Harriers claimed: “An incident happened as a direct consequence of hunt saboteurs, who distracted a few of our young hounds. “The deer escaped without serious injury and our hunt staff removed the hounds despite  allegations.” "},{"url":null,"title":"saira khan when comes bedroom","story":"NewsopinionSaira Khan - When it comes to the bedroom women do not prioritise themselvesIt’s like women have been conditioned to faking it in the bedroom.

But it’s not about steam-cleaning bits, pricey lip balm or conscious uncoupling. She’s got women talking about sex – and learning how to have real fun ­between the sheets.A friend of mine, who’s in her s, alerted me to Gwynnie’s new Netflix series, The Goop Lab, where she explores wellnessy things. The show that shocked my mate and got her red-faced was on female orgasms.“Is nothing sacred ” she asked me, like this topic should be kept firmly in the bedroom. But the thing is, women have been living a lie in the bedroom. For years we have been faking our own pleasure or been too ashamed to talk about what we want. When it comes to the bedroom, like in so many places, women do not ­prioritise themselves. I’m guilty of this. I’ve faked it to please a bloke just to make him feel like a stallion, resigned to feeling unsatisfied between the sheets. It’s like women have been conditioned to do it. Especially growing up in the Asian community, where sex and any naughty pleasure outside marriage is seen as shameful. I certainly never talked about sex to other women and definitely not to my mum. But I’d like to be able to talk to my son about the ins and outs, so to speak, so he doesn’t think sex in films and porn is realistic. All those perfect bodies and women satisfied in seconds. The reality is, it takes time to get to your Harry Met Sally moment – some women can take  minutes,they get there at all. So much of it starts in the mind with us girls. We are built dferently to blokes.  But we expect them to be psychic and know how we work. And we are to blame for that because to give them the skills, we need to share how we feel and quite often we don’t even know what we like anyway. No wonder so many women do not have orgasms.. I’m nearly  and I have never used a vibrator – why have I denied myself that  Times are changing and I hope the younger generation have the confidence to say what they want. In Gwynnie’s show, she has chats with a fabulous sex therapist, Betty Dodson, a very frank and funny woman who is  and has taught thousands of women how to explore their bodies. She pointed out the fact that our “private parts” are masked with so much shame, we can’t even say their name and do not know what they look like.

Dan Suri, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: “A relatively deep area of a low-pressure system on Monday provides a continuation of the extremely unsettled period the UK has endured.  Despite reports to the contrary, this system hasn’t been named, and there is no plan to do so currently, despite some speculation on social media.” The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has issued  flood warnings and eight flood alerts.  Mr Suri added: With further rain in the forecast over the coming days, additional rainfall could create further challenges as river catchments are more likely to respond to extra rainfall more quickly. Flooding, especially in areas already heavily affected, remains a possibility.” Scott Squires, Duty Tactical Manager for Natural Resources Wales said: “As the floodwaters recede and communities start to get back on their feet, we’ll continue to support local authorities and emergency service in these affected areas.  Over the coming days our teams will be checking for any signs of damage to our flood defences, and removing blockages and debris which has built up in culverts and drainage grids etc.”More warning for snow are in place on Monday as severe weather is expected to spread northeastwards into Scotland early on Monday, thereports.

Another elderly neighbour, who was one of the first occupants of Vauxhall Street, has reportedly been told to pay within five years. I am even willing to sell my flat back to them, Ms Shepherd said.

But you can only be influential as a front twoeverybody  is doing their bit behind it.“It was -- v -- in the second half and in extra-time. There is a trade off there because although we had more attacking threat we had less control of the game.“Kilmarnock could have picked us off at times on the counter-attack, but that’s the trade off. And I do think there are times when the two can play up front together.”Cosgrove has been on the bench for Aberdeen’s last three outings following a dip in form after the Premiership’s winter break.But on Wednesday night in Ayrshire the English hitman was back among the goals, netting his nd of the season from the penalty spot in extra time.McInnes was delighted with the -year-old nerves to dispatch the spot-kick and hopes that strike can boost Cosgrove’s confidence and lead to more goals in the weeks to come.The Premiership’s longest serving manager added: “Looking back now it’s almost forgotten that it was a penalty with huge pressure on it.“In Sam’s mind when he steps up he’s thinkinghe misses then we’re out of the cup.“But he didn’t and good on him. If I wanted anybody to take a penalty in that situation it would be him because he’s so good at them.“His performance in the second half and in extra-time was good.

Shay Logan was back in on the right of a four-man defence.Youngster Dean Campbell paired Lewis Ferguson in central midfield.Relegated to the bench were winger Matty Kennedy, who’d started every game since joining from St Johnstone last month, and middle-man Dylan McGeouch. Summer signing Craig Bryson was absent entirely, once more injured – this time with a groin strain.It took until  minutes for the first effort on goal at windy Pittodrie to arrive, Don Cowie fizzing a low long-range effort by the left post.Soon after Niall McGinn curled a free-kick over Ross Laidlaw’s goal from  yards.On  minutes, Campbell was booked for blocking off Josh Mullin, before the Dons won the ball back and Cosgrove – fed by partner Main – pulled a shot across goal from  yards.As the home side started to click into gear, Callum Morris was the second man in referee Gavin Duncan’s notebook, chopping down Cosgrove has he drove forward with the ball.Aberdeen went in front on  minutes. After a McGinn-Campbell corner routine which saw the teenager swing the ball in left-footed and Liam Fontaine fail to deal with the delivery at the front post, Cosgrove nodded down to Main to finish from close range.Just as Pittodrie was thinking “here we go”, Campbell was dismissed by the referee, earning a cheap second booking for not being far enough back at a County free-kick.This meant goalscorer Main was forced to fill the void in the middle of the park by dropping back.The high from the goal had faded, however, the Dons still had the next big opening, with Cosgrove stopped by the sliding Laidlaw at the edge of his box after a great run and through-ball from Connor McLennan. Main then ballooned a second bite at getting a shot away over from distance.County equalised with two minutes of the half to play, Billy Mckay heading ex-Red Richard Foster’s cross beyond Joe Lewis.After the break, the visitors would’ve been in front but for Joe Lewis, with the keeper rushing out to close down Billy Mckay after Scott McKenna played a woeful blind back pass.Lewis then denied Erwin with his foot on the follow-up.Moments later, Lewis Ferguson’s raking effort from  yards hit the Staggies’ left post and Laidlaw done very well to tip away McGinn’s attempt to find the far top corner on the rebound.There followed a period where both sides struggled to create much of note in the final third.The Staggies undoubtedly had the better opportunities of the second period, however.And, with less than  minutes left, Lewis made a fantastic save after Mullin’s effort from the edge of the box was deflected towards the top left corner of the Aberdeen goal.On  minutes, the visitors got their winner. Mckay firing low from the left side of the box into the far corner after an incisive ball through the middle of McKenna and Taylor."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne.

Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Indeed, the suggestion has been made that any opinions counter to the management view have been distinctly unwelcome.Nobody is suggesting that Knapdale Ward is perfect, and common sense tells us that dementia patients are more comfortable and relaxed in their home environment. An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

The charity works hand in hand with some of the poorest communities in Madagascar to improve their lives and their environment.By addressing people#s primary needs, such as health, sanitation and agriculture, the charity allows them to focus on longer-term challenges, like education, legal tenure and livelihoods. In the process the charity not only saves lives and improves community health, food security, education and prosperity, it also encourages and enables people to look after the forests on which they depend. So far, over , hectares of forest, fauna and flora has been protected.Taking part in the , mile unsupported rowing race across the Atlantic Ocean, the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, the Maclean brothers were setting out to raise £, for two good causes – Argyll charity Feedback Madagascar and Children st.Facing wind, rain, huge waves, fatigue and battery problems, the brothers rowed day and night, repeating shts of two hours of rowing and one hour of rest.One and a half million oar strokes later, they completed the gruelling challenge in an incredible  days  hours and  minutes, winning the trio class and placing third overall. And setting three world records in the process they are the first three brothers to row any ocean, the fastest trio to row across the Atlantic and the youngest trio to row across the Atlantic.In the time it took the brave Maclean brothers to row the Atlantic, Feedback Madagascar was able to undertake their feasibility study for the first BROARhole in Andranomena and begin the project.Breaking ground on the first BROARhole, Jamie Spencer said: #The MacLean brothers have raised so much awareness for Feedback Madagascar since their record-breaking Atlantic row.

commitment to upgrade an informal path at new housing in Musselburgh as part of its planning consent discharged.One mother who attended a meeting of the planning committee said her family moved into the new housing after she was told the path would be created, offering a safe route to school for her children.However, lawyer Alasdair Sutherland, who represented Taylor Wimpey at the meeting, said it had come to light the developers did not own the land the path was on.He argued that without ownership of the land, the council could not enforce the condition and make the developers upgrade the path.The path, known locally as The Drt, runs from the new housing at Pinkie Mains down to the railway bridge and links Musselburgh to Wallyford Railway Station and Wallyford Primary School.Kaye Nicoll told the committee that she currently has to cross  roads to get her daughter to school after moving onto the new estate two years ago.She said: ldquoWe were delighted when Taylor Wimpey told us there was going to be a path almost from the back of our house.ldquoI think every child should walk to school and my daughter is now nine and desperate to walk on her own.ldquoI cannot allow her to cross all those roads on her own, some of them are quite dangerous for a nine-year-old.The committee was told that Taylor Wimpey was granted planning permission to build  houses and  flats at Pinkie Mains in March  and one of the conditions attached was that The Drt ldquoshall be constructed to an adoptable standard, including street lighting, along the extent of it between Pinkie Terrace and the East Coast Main Line under bridge.It also called for new connections to be added from two cul-de-sacs in the development.An application to have the condition discharged was made after East Lothian Council planning officers threatened to take enforcement action over the firmrsquos failure to construct the path.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoI am extremely disappointed a company like Taylor Wimpey have taken a decision not to honour a condition proposed by this planning committee.ldquoThey actually used this as a way to sell properties to people this is not an honourable thing to do.Councillor Colin McGinn said: ldquoSurely the developer would look at the conditions and make sure they could meet them before starting to build because in this case it seems they have just built and built and then looked at the conditions.Keith Dingwall, head of planning, told the committee that upgrading the path would cost pound,.Councillor Kenny McLeod pointed out the cost was equivalent to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix.

The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence.

Did Emmanuel Macron arrive at work in a onesie when the gillets jaunes were torching Paris  Did Channel  presenter Jon Snow fling on any old tie or boring socks because it was Election Night But there was Guardiola in a baggy oatmeal fine-knit jumper that did his midrf no favours. That porridgy colour can be cruel, especially when, as in this case, it didnrsquot fit. The sleeves were long enough to double as skipping ropes. It was worn over a white teeshirt which, to be fair, was as white asstraight out of the wrapper, but his trousers were so faded and dreary no self-respecting charity shop would have put them in the window.Doubtless everything bore a designer label, but that means nothing. As I once discovered, it is entirely possible to enter an eye-wateringly pricey emporium and emerge from the changing rooms looking like a walking bin bag. Despite his position as one of the most prominent figures in sport, and with no financial constraints on his wardrobe, Guardiola chose that day ndash and many others ndash to look more like a sloppy teenager who has retrieved his stuff from the laundry basket for the third day running than a premier league manager and representative of the sporting elite.In this, I should quickly add, he is not alone. There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf. Such slovenliness gives two fingers to the quaint idea that, when yoursquore at the heart of government, what you wear matters. If this is thinking outside the box, then Cummings has certainly nailed it.If yoursquore like me, you yearn for the days of Cary Grant. Gentlemenrsquos magazines in the s ran features on how to emulate his debonair outfits. But as everyone knows, while clothes maketh the man, some men maketh clothes look better than others. Grantrsquos Italian suits, fedora and glossy shoes gave him an almost regal presence. There was an artistry in the way he put things together, his raincoat draping around him in graceful folds ashe were a human waterfall, rather than bunched at the waist like a scarecrow. Dean Martin was another snappy dresser, as was Frank Sinatra, in his street-wise way, though for my taste he was a little too slick. When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid. To an extent, we all do.Sadly we donrsquot have too many sartorial icons here, although Sean Connery was never more striking than when the James Bond costume department got their hands on him. Thereafter, his preferred mode was that of a golfer who has accidentally strayed from the ninth hole. Ten or so years ago, one brave MSP friend publicly decried the national love of shell suits, only for the tabloid guns to be turned full-bore upon him.

But elation is in the mix, too. Is that because hersquos helped himself to a sly slug of the rich black perk-you-up brew bubbling volcanically in the corner of the coffee house  Possibly. However, the main reason hersquos in an upbeat mood is that a dream came true the day before. And today that dream continues.Imran is the co-owner of the Ottoman Coffee House, along with his brother Irfan. For several years theyrsquove used the location to host occasional parties and charitable events. But for the most part it has lain dormant, lurking just below the surface of the general publicrsquos awareness. A myth and a mystery to most, like a certain shy water-serpent from down Loch Ness way.For those who did manage to cross the threshold, it was almost like stumbling into the toy shop where that saggy old cloth cat Bagpuss occasionally woke to tell his tall tales. Or the quirky clothes store where Mr Benn got booted and suited and bolstered for adventure.Nerve-rackingRecently rumours started to circulate about the Ottoman Coffee House. Glasgowrsquos more knowledgeable boulediers whispered to each other in tones of conspiratorial awe and wonder: ldquoAn under-the-radar coffee shop, you say  With doors firmly slammed shut to the hoi polloi  Then let us snag an invitation at all costshellipIt was never the brothers Akhtarrsquos intention to keep the business hush-hush for so long. The reason it wasnrsquot open for regular customers is disappointingly prosaic, and dispels the fog of mystery that has for so long enveloped the curious bolthole, like a peasouper draped over Sherlock Holmesrsquos London.The unnished truth is that Imran and Irfan were far too busy to give the place the necessary love and attention it needed to thrive as a commercial proposition. They both have full time jobs that have nothing to do with catering, meaning there was precious little time to set up a fully operational coffee house.Yet the dream never died. And then, exactly one day before my visit, the dream became a reality, with just a little bit of nightmare tossed into the blend, to give the brew a slightly acrid tang. But no matter. Imran canrsquot contain his excitement, even with weather woes, electrical mishaps and supplies not turning up on time. ldquoItrsquos incredible that wersquove now actually opened for full-time business, he says. ldquoIncredible, but also a little bit nerve-racking.He sits me at a table and asks his brother to prepare coffee. And, no, that doesnrsquot mean a few heaped tablespoons of Maxwell House tossed in a mug. Nor is it the sort of homogenised gloop available in those MacCoffee shops that are scattered across every town in Scotland. Itrsquos not even that swanky Italian coffee, best drunk while wearing sunglasses, and before scooting off on a Vespa.Whatrsquos on offer here is unfiltered Yemeni-style coffee. ldquoItrsquos similar to an espresso, says Imran, ldquoBut an espresso is acidic and bitter. This is much lighter. Whereas an espresso hits your tongue and lower palate, this gives you a chocolaty full-bodied flavour in the mouth.Souness the MagnicentWhile Irsquom sipping my drinkImran and I talk coffee. We delve into the history of the drink, which my host has researched thoroughly, becoming quite the geek regarding the grinding of beans.ldquoThere are some stories that say coffee started in the farming communities of Ethiopia, he tells me. ldquoApparently the sheep were tasting these beans and acting pretty lively. A coffee house was opened for the first time in  in Istanbul. This was in the days of the Ottoman Empire. ldquoIt was two brothers who launched that place, too, says Imran with a proud twinkle in his eye.Because the empire was vast, the popularity of coffee spread far and wide. The pitch black brew drenched entire countries and cultures. However, Imran and his brother want to bring back some of the distinctive flavour of those original coffee establishments. The deacutecor in their establishment has a Turkish feel to it, which isnrsquot surprising as most of the furnishings were bought in the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul where the Akhtar brothers were holidaying.There are also ious paintings on the walls of impressive looking personages. ldquoThose are pictures of Sultans, says Imran. Pointing to the portrait next to our table, he adds: ldquoThat one there is Suleiman the Magnicent.I peer at the canvas. Blimey. Suliman looks an awful lot like a certain former Rangers manager.ldquoIt could be Graeme Souness the Magnicent, I point out.Imran groans. ldquoYoursquore right, he says. ldquoNow every time I look at that painting, I wonrsquot be able to stop thinking that.Souness is perhaps best remembered in Glasgow for bravely grasping the thorny issue of segregation in the city, by signing Mo Johnston all those years ago and making the club more cosmopolitan.So perhaps it makes a strange kind of sense that a Souness-like fizzog is watching over the Ottoman Coffee House. Because this is a very cosmopolitan joint, with a genuinely eclectic clientele.ldquoWe want our place to be somewhere you can come in and chat and meet dferent cultures, says Imran. ldquoWersquove got Arabs over there, he says pointing at one table. ldquoAnd there are a few Turks at the back. Hopefully this place can be a regular sort of United Nations.Give a little backJust as important to Imran is the vibe the place offers. He doesnrsquot want people to feel theyrsquore being harried and hustled out the door. There are chess sets to play, sofas to sink into. Afternoons to ease through in a slumberous cat-in-a-sunbeam sort of fashion.ldquoPeople donrsquot want to get up in a rush, and I donrsquot want them feeling they have to get up in a rush, he says. ldquoWersquove already had people queuing to get in. But Irsquod rather they would come back after an hour, or maybe another day, so that the people inside can just relax.Food is provided on the premises courtesy of a pop-up kitchen run by Yemeni suppliers. ldquoItrsquos a lot like Asian food, though not as heavy, says Imran. ldquoAlso the spices are very subtle.The community kitchen was also set up to provide food packages for the homeless. Helping those who are struggling is very important to the brothers Akhtar.Imran explains that his father, a respected and successful Glasgow restaurateur, originally bought the space that is now the Ottoman Coffee House intending to turn it into a restaurant. But when he was refused an alcohol licence the plan floundered, resulting in him eventually losing his house.ldquoThings can be going well, and then, just like that, yoursquore struggling, says Imran. ldquoAnd it can come out of nowhere. So you never know why someone is homeless, or what theyrsquove been through. Thatrsquos why I think itrsquos so important to try and give a little back to those in most need.Imran says he learned a lot from his father, who died a few years ago. ldquoHe never complained and was always smiling and positive, even when times were really rough, he says. ldquoRemembering his attitude is incredibly inspiring for me and my brother. Especially when we are trying to push forward and achieve so much with this coffee house."},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-political-diary","story":"NEW Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw is obsessed with the size of his mandate, Unspun fears.

After Brexit, the only well-founded complaints about immigration ndash that matters such as deportation and access to welfare services were outwith UK control ndash are settled. Nor, in political terms, is there any need to pander to the tiny minoritywhose objection to immigration looks suspiciously like xenophobia.Governments do not need to dictate quotas, points-based systems reliant on nebulously defined skills or unrealistic salaries it is businesses, communities and public services that are best placed to identy the need to attract workers from where. It is bizarre that a Government that calls itself Conservative should opt for a centralised, state-managed, position, rather than trusting such decisions to those most affected by them.With devolved government, flexibility should be the default position. The English regions have their own needs too, but separate tax codes for Scottish residents ought to make decision-making that works for local circumstances readily achievable.Claims that immigration has driven down wages are much less plausible than the view that it is the ludicrously complex tax credits system, amounting to a taxpayersrsquo subsidy of large corporations, which is the main culprit. Immigration per se is not damaging: the evidence suggests it is a boon.For Scotland, it is a necessity. The important powers ndash deporting criminals, the ability not to have to take any and every EU citizen, offering them the same benefits and state support as UK nationals ndash are already Westminsterrsquos. There is no need to insist upon micromanaging the needs of local communities or businesses, let alone to dictate the priorities of a devolved government in Scotland.A bridge too farThe Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement that it may be several years before the issues surrounding the Queensferry Crossing are resolved shows not just the deficiencies endemic in ministerial oversight of public works, but the torpor which impedes attempts to recty matters.This newspaper did not criticise the Government for bad weather, the formation of ice on the bridge, or for itsdecision to close the crossing on safety grounds. Our complaint is that a problem was identied almost a year before this crisis arose, and the reaction of those responsible was dilatory, complacent, and utterly beneath the standard that the public ndash which depends on the service, and has paid for its construction ndash has a right to expect.The impressive achievements of the project ndash as a piece of engineering, and as public infrastructure built on time and under budget ndash risk being undermined by this failure. The pressure on politicians to obtain value for money is justied, but the taxpayer has a right to expect that the whole value of a tender be given the same scrutiny as the bottom line of the bill. Public works which prove unfit for purpose, thanks to short-term cost-cutting, or a lack of attention to detail from those elected to oversee infrastructure projects ndash be they hospitals, ferries, schools or transport links ndash are no saving in the long term.Elected officials have failed to meet public expectations, the most basic of which is not just what the taxpayer ends up paying, but that the finished product comes up to scratch. That is a fair cause for criticism, and an imperative for closer oversight in any future works of this kind."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-first-ministers-education-pledge-truly-come-back-haunt","story":"Unfortunately, Ms Sturgeon is wriggling and squirming as she tries to find some new excuse for why her neck should not be on the line. An official report posted online at the very unusual time of pm on Thursday shows there has been a drop of up to  per cent of students passing Higher exams in core subjects with , fewer pupils passing Higher English compared to the year before .We are judging you, First Minister, and you have failed miserably.Jane Lax, Aberlour.JOHN Swinney was at his Sir Humphrey Appleton best in explaining how the very poor Highers results were, in effect, an SNP triumph. Ignoring the obvious is becoming an SNP trademark. As Scotland gradually sinks down all the league tables, it is also losing its desirability to the European Union of offering membership to a state so riven with problems. It might not actually be the Tories who save the Union after all, it might be the SNP itself.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.NICOLA Sturgeon has asked that she be judged on her record on education, so the disclosure that the there is a marked decline in attainment in Highers in key subjects must be a source of worry and embarrassment for her, but perhaps not. The results, showing a decline in our gold standard in education is a serious worry for all of us who care deeply for the future prospects of our young people, when they will have to compete for university places against young people from other countries who are achieving much better grades. A cynic might say that this situation might benefit the SNP Government as our pupils will not have the qualications to apply for university, so solving the cap on university places for Scottish pupils.However, the downward trend in Highers is even more worrying as it will almost certainly be a deterrent to future foreign investors who will be looking for a highly educated workforce, and sadly Scotland is increasingly unable to supply such a pool of talent.Maureen Henry, Bearsden.I WAS interested to note that there is to be a review of Curriculum for Excellence by OECD on behalf of the Scottish Government.Because the nature and outcome of any such review is critical, it would be very useful to know the answers to a number of questions.. The nature and extent of the review, its subsequent report and timetable.. The composition and size of the OECD team. For example, will it be composed of academics selected from several countries or will it include experienced Heads of education from authorities or regions, headteachers, teachers who have been through similar experiences . The actual gathering of evidence. For example, will it include meetings  discussions with representatives of the principal teaching unions, the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, the Association of Headteachers and Deputies in Scotland, universities and further education, SQA  How many schools will be visited, classes seen and senior and unpromoted staff met to see the curriculum in action and its consequences . Does the above basis for gathering evidence seem over-ambitious, impractical or implausible  I suggest not, but such an exercise requires the use of suitably experienced and qualied people, time and effort to form the basis of an effective review. If the review does not extend beyond a potentially cursory visit, then, I suggest, it is a waste of time and money and will have little credibility and, sadly, fail to resolve perceived weaknesses in the current provision.At the very least, it would helpthe Government publicises its proposals as soon as possible.GPD Gordon, Bearsden.ONE gets the very strong impression from the BBC, and indeed from the media in general, that nothing goes right in Scotland and there is one \"problem\" after another to report on a daily basis, but not much to praise.It might be helpful thenThe Herald and even the BBC, were to look at the international sepsis problem of terrible infections, with a high death rate in world hospitals which is increasing in most countries.The NHS in Scotland strongly reversed that trend in the period -, which shows a remarkable per cent-plus reduction in one year. This appears to be as a result of more effective hospital cleaning services. The new level of sepsis infection in Scottish hospitals is half of the level in England and only one-third of the level in the United States. So perhaps you could look into this and give Scotland some credit for a change and do something useful by drawing attention to other health providers what is being achieved by the Scottish NHS.

This should only be done with a full evaluation to understand its effectiveness and impacts.However in the policy revealed on Tuesday by Priti Patel, no mention of the scheme was made, prompting concern from Scottish business owners and politicians that it may not happen at all.The Scottish Government said it was deeply concerned that the proposals have not been mentioned since they were recommended by MAC, and demanded Westminster seriously consider its suggestions of implementing a Scottish visa.Some in the hospitality, tourism and agriculture sectors have already told of how the plans would cripple their businesses, with some firms employing % of their workers who are not from the UK.Home Secretary Patel said thatbusinesses foresee problems with the plan, they should automate their processes or find a dferent way of working, promoting further outcry up and down the country.The Scottish Governments Migration Minister Ben Macpherson has today reiterated the calls for a rural pilot scheme, and has urged Boris Johnsons Government to ensure it is in the policy before changes take effect in January .He said: \"The Scottish Government and many others across the business community and the third sector have made it unequivocally clear to the UK Government that their immigration plans would deeply damage Scotlandrsquos economic, social and demographic prosperity.ldquoThe proposals would be catastrophic for rural areas, which are particularly dependent on migration to sustain local communities and public services, so it is deeply worrying that the UK Government does not appear to mention anywhere in these latest proposals their own prior commitment to running rural migration pilots.ldquoThe Scottish Government put forward a clear, workable proposal for devolving immigration powers and introducing a Scottish visa, which would allow Scotland to attract and retain people with the skills and attributes we need for all our communities and economy to flourish.ldquoThe UK Government must now seriously engage with these proposals, which have widespread support across Scotland.A Home Office spokesman told The Herald on Sunday there were several elements of the policy on immigration still being discussed, with further announcements to be made in the coming months.They could not confirmthe rural pilot schemes would be part of these announcements, but said that applying dferent immigration rules to dferent parts of the UK would overly complicate the immigration system and cause signicant dficulties for employers who need the flexibility to deploy their staff across the UK.A spokeswoman said: \"The UK points-based immigration system will work in the interests of the whole country ndash Scotland included.ldquoIt will attract the brightest and the best from around the globe, boost the economy and our communities as well as ending free movement bringing overall migration numbers down."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-back-stone-age-rubber-pavements-stodge-free-moaning-name-progress","story":"ITrsquoS been another bad week for Extinction Rebellion , and thatrsquos good news for the planet.Most people accept scientic analysis of climate, which says the atmosphere is hotting up at an unsustainable rate, leading to deleterious meteorological phenomena. Wersquore all trying to do something, evenit feels like small beer, such as household recycling.This week, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service announced a ban on traditional cups of tea for donors as these arenrsquot ldquoenvironmentally friendly. The cups of tea, that is, not the donors . And itrsquos not the tea itself, but the polystyrene cups. Irsquom guessing good china canrsquot be used as they donrsquot have anyone to clean them. Itrsquos called progress. You wouldnrsquot understand.The transfusion service has a decent case, though a small voice whispers that itrsquos just a gesture, doing something to be seen to be doing something.Extra-parliamentary politics is all gesture, and they donrsquot come more full of jest than XR, widely slated this week for digging up lawns and creating a mess at the Home Office and Cambridge University to make a point that remains unclear.To say the least, digging up grass is not a good look for greens. It was such bad PR that one suspects theyrsquove engaged PR professionals.Therersquos more than a hint, too, in XR of middle-class larpersturning a serious crisis into cheap drama, taking leading parts for the cameras, dressing in red robes and looking like sententious priests from some weird interplanetary cult on Star Trek.Various predictions since the s averred wersquod all have boiled or frozen or starved to death by . All came to nought. And, going back through the centuries, you canrsquot help feeling XR is just the latest of these end-is-nigh cults that are a recurring phenomenon of hysteria in human history.Worse is to come for, already, there are people who feel XR isnrsquot going far enough. One such is Professor Patricia MacCormack, of Anglia Ruskin University, who says in her book, The Ahuman Manesto, that giving birth is ldquothe worst thing you can do to the climate.Irsquod some sympathy with this idea at first, until I realised it would lead to human extinction. And sure enough, according to the publisherrsquos publicity, the book ldquoembraces issues like human extinction, vegan abolition, atheist occultism, death studies, a refusal of identity politics, deep ecology, and the apocalypse as an optimistic beginning. Optimistic. I see.According to a review by Margrit Shildrick, guest professor of gender and knowledge productionat Stockholm University : ldquoAs a vegan abolitionist extinctionist, she [MacCormack] provides an unrelenting and exacting take-down of the violent self-interest of the human species ...Elsewhere, Prof MacCormack, who reportedly moonlights as a DJ, complains that the planetrsquos problems have been caused by ldquocreating this hierarchical world where white, male, heterosexual people are succeeding. Yes, terrible business.If this is your polystyrene cup of tea, you can find more on YouTube, where Patricia, or Morticia as shersquos been dubbed, partly for her Goth appearance, discusses ldquovulvic demaonitalia, which I donrsquot need to tell you invokes ldquodemonic convocation as an important ethical feminist and queer practice.Jeez. Tell you what: people of my vintage feel partly responsible for all this nutterism. We marched for womenrsquos rights, gay rights, Greenpeace . Now behold the monster wersquove created.The progressivism we championed is progressing us back to the stone age. Itrsquos like a big mad ball that keeps gaining momentum until itrsquos out of control and bouncing back towards us for a spectacular own goal.Fall and rise of bouncing OAPsHERErsquoS something we should have thought of before to help personkind on its way: rubber pavements. Scientists are developing new sidewalk surfaces made from recycled tyres.The purpose is to reduce injuries among pensioners, who have a bizarre habit of falling to the ground. It says here that one in three OAPs takes a tumble each year in Britain, with many suffering hip fractures.But Professor Cesare Sangiorgi, from the University of Bologna, says: ldquo[If] people fall on our pavement, they are less likely to suffer injuries because the severity of the fall will be substantially reduced. It can reduce the burden on the health service.Too right. Apparently, falls cost the NHS pound. billion a year, which of course isnrsquot a true figure but the usual public spending fiction. All the same, falls must cost the service a pretty penny.The new pavement is to be piloted in Sweden, where old people are considered expendable and often used in experiments.No one is denying that old people should buck up their ideas when out walking but, since this is unlikely to happen soon, anything that helps them bounce back on their feet is welcome.Bacterial ersity a no-brainerAW, so to speak, naw. Yet again, wersquore being told to eat a Mediterranean diet, which consists of appalling rubbish like tomatoes, olive oil and garlic, the very thought of which is enough to make decent Britons gag.The new sales pitch is that the Med diet stems the loss of bacterial ersity ndash yawn ndash delaying the onset of frailty in old age and protecting brain , something thatrsquos always been over-rated in my experience.Itrsquos not just top complainers like me moaning about this alien cuisine, with its cheerless lack of stodge. Online, leading intellectuals said you had to live in a Mediterranean country for it to work and that it wasnrsquot suitable for a joyless dreich joint like Scotland.Sunshine in particular was adduced as a key ingredient for long le, though scientic evidence suggests it boils the brain and leads to instability. For clarication: not scientic evidence but informed guesswork .After a while, to be frank, it gets irritating to keep reading that everybody  is eating right except us and that we deserve to die for our homely, comforting fare.

There are kids that I was with in the early s whotheyrsquore still alive will not have known one day of peace. Anwarirsquos son is -ish and hersquos never known it. It was the th anniversary of the Soviet invasion on Christmas day. ##Readers of this paper, The Herald on Sunday, The Herald and the former Sunday Herald will be familiar with Prattrsquos extraordinary photojournalism and reports from war-torn parts of the world ndash Iraq, Gaza, Syria, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Bosnia.The title of a recent exhibition of his photographs, Only With The Heart, was taken from a quote by Antoine de Saint-Exupery: ldquoIt is only with the heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye.There are few journalists with more heart, or more commitment to the stories they report on. The focus of this first documentary about his work is Afghanistan because itrsquos a country he has been visiting for over four decades. Itrsquos where a piece of his heart is. ##The idea, he tells says, of reporting from Afghanistan first entered his imagination when he was lying in a bed in a hospital in Nicaragua, feverish with malaria, after he had gone out there, just out of art school, to cover the revolution.As he suffered in the stling heat, he came across a copy of National Geographic with Steve McCurryrsquos iconic image of a young Afghan woman on the cover.ldquoI flicked through and I remember the pictures were of snowy mountains in Afghanistan ndash and I was sweltering in this hospital from malaria and, God, it looked so inviting almost by contrast, he recalls. ##Pratt wasnrsquot a stereotypical war reporter from a privileged background. He was a working-class boy who had grown up in the Hillhouse scheme near Hamilton, which, he says, they used to call ldquoBeirut or Hellhouse. The first time he was ever shot at, he describes, was in the street there, when he was seven years old and someone ldquotook a pot shot at the postman who had failed to deliver his giro benefit cheque, and he happened to be walking nearby.##His background is one of the things that makes his early trips all the more remarkable. ldquoWorking-class people were not meant to do what I was doing, he says. ldquoEvery foreign correspondent at that time was middle or upper class. There were times when I didnrsquot have the #price of a tube fare to come in from my flat in the southside of Glasgow for meetings in the city centre, but I was planning to go to Afghanistan in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoYou would beg, borrow and steal to get the money to get to these places. I feltI ended up getting clobbered in Afghanistan at least theyrsquore not going to come looking for my overdraft. There was a degree of fate about it.##Pratt was looking out at the world at a particular political moment ndash the early s, following the revolution in Nicaragua, the Iranian revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, all of which had taken place in . ldquoAfghanistan wasnrsquot really known at that time, he recalls. ldquoIt was still an obscure backwater. The only thing yoursquod read about it was the hippy trail. But the politics of the region werenrsquot known.ldquoThe religious aspect of it was misunderstood. A lot of the mujahideen groups were Islamist, but they werenrsquot absolutely rabid fundamentalists like the Taliban. They just didnrsquot like the bloody Russians. And can you blame them ##Pratt didnrsquot head out there looking for a specic story ndash though he had an interest in guerrilla movements and underdogs. ldquoI wasnrsquot looking at the grand politics of things, he says. ldquoI was very interested in how people lived. Although the irony is that by the stage I went to Afghanistan, I was very left-wing. I was actually a card-carrying member of the communist party.ldquoIf the mujahideen had known I was a communist it would have been curtains. They wouldnrsquot have waited to find out that I was interested in the notion of resistance and guerrilla movements.##His route into Afghanistan involved illegally crossing the border from Pakistan. The way Pratt tells it, it sounds like after a small amount of research. He flew to Peshawar on a wing and a prayer ndash with few connections. ldquoAfghanaid was my first port of call in Peshawar and they kind of sent me in the direction of one or two mujahideen, but I had to make those approaches myself.##What strikes you almost immediately is how risky his forays into Afghanistan were. He travelled with small groups of mujahideen, slept in caves, moved at night, and, when he fell ill, which he did, would have to be smuggled back out of the country. Often the groups he was with were making -hour marches through the Hindu Kush.He was also highly dependent on the mujahideen guerrillas who took him into the country, people like Sayed Anwari, with whom he formed a close friendship. ldquoWithout them, it would have been impossible. I went back and forward across the border in all these dferent guises. I got caught dressed as a woman in a burka. I went in a coffin, behind grain sacks. Anwari would organise these elaborate ways of getting in and out. I was completely dependent on them.##His le was at risk on countless occasions. In the film, he describes one occasion when he and the group he was with had to beat a retreat from mortar bombardment. ldquoRounds were landing all around you ndash people were going into the air, pieces of them coming off, body parts everywhere.As he and the others around him ran, he passed a man whose knee had been blown off. The man put his hand out asto ask for help, but shells were still landing all around him and he had to run on. ldquoThere is a kind of guilt about that, Pratt says in the film.##You canrsquot help but wonder what his parents and friends must have been thinking. In those times,you travelled in remote areas, you were essentially dropping off the map, cutting all connection with home. ldquoThere were no mobile phones, he says. ldquoThere was no contact. Some of the trips were months on end, and you would cross the border illegally into Afghanistan and disappear off the radar. I might never have come back. ##His parents however, were already used to these disappearances. At  years old, already a keen mountaineer, he was hitchhiking to Glencoe, sleeping under bridges and tackling serious rock-climbing routes. ldquoI was already doing that, so the idea of prolonged absences was no shock to my parents, he says.##The assumption when he was growing up had always been that he would join the military. ldquoIt was a very male-dominated family, says Pratt. ldquoMy uncles were in the military. My father had done his national service in the Middle East. That upbringing instilled in him ldquoan urge to see the world. He goes on: ldquoThe military may have been a way of doing that, but in the end I got really politically opposed to things military. ##Instead he did ldquothe polar opposite and went to Glasgow School of Art, and that was where his journey towards documentary photography began. ldquoSome of my close student friends could see my increasing interest in documentary work. They were seeing a drt towards the political and the fact that a painting was too contemplative for me. The camera was a more immediate tool.##Pratt made scores of trips into Afghanistan during the s. Some were for only two or three days, but his longest was for over three months.What does he think he learned in those early years ldquoIt was mostly finding out about myself, he says. ldquoIt was physically and psychologically very hard. I was on my own. You would be three months in the mountains. My interpreter was a young engineering student from Kabul University who did not want to be a guerilla and didnrsquot want to be hoofing over the Hindu Kush mountains, so when he was given the task by Anwari he actually loathed me because Irsquod got him into this situation. We became great friends. So those long hikes over the mountains were finding out about ourselves.##Pratt kept going back to Afghanistan even after the Soviet withdrawal in . ldquoFrom the s, the mujahideen were bickering among themselves, he recalls. ldquoIt was horrendous and the West was not really interested. I was determined to cover it simply because it wasnrsquot getting covered. No-one was interested now it was Afghans fighting Afghans, not Afghans fighting the Communists any more.##Afghanistan remains war-torn, a precarious and unstable democracy. What happens there is little talked about in the West ndash a recent New York Times editorial described it as ldquoThe Unspeakable War. Meanwhile, the Taliban wages violence and controls many parts of the country.In the documentary, Pratt talks with a Taliban leader by telephone, and is told that peace will only be possible in Afghanistanthe barriers to it are lted ndash and that this would ldquorequire all foreign troops to leave Afghanistan. In recent days that possibility has come closer with the announcement from the Taliban that they are on the threshold of a historic agreement with the USA which would involve withdrawal of troops.##During his film, Pratt s to many of the frontlines from which he reported. The zoo, the site of his startling  image of a sheep wandering across a background of rubble and armoured tank, now feels like a bustling attraction in any city. But, he says, Kabul remains a scary place. When his documentary team visited the Puli Mahmood Kahn district, another former frontline, they were told by their security officers that people up the street were making calls on their mobile phones.ldquoThat area is Taliban central. We bundled into the car and shot off. We had to get up the street and we did a right on to the main highway and the security guy told the driver to do a complete U-turn in the middle of the street and then go back the other way because otherwise the Taliban could ambush us further on. Yoursquore living with that all the time in Kabul.##Pratt went on to cover conflicts in many other parts of the world. The longer he went out for, he says, the harder it would be to adjust. ldquoAfter I was kidnapped in Bosnia, I went to ground for about six months.He also found it hard sometimes to be sympathetic when people back home were stuck on petty concerns.ldquoI remember coming back from Nicaragua, says Pratt. ldquoI was really quite sick and there was a woman on the last leg from Madrid to London and all she went on about was whether the driver she had would be waiting for her at Heathrow airport. Three days earlier Irsquod been in a refugee camp and Irsquod watched them put a machine gun in an adjacent area and fire on the refugees in the camp. Itrsquos dficult not to get angry. But peoplersquos problems are relative. ##For Pratt, the process of making the documentary has been ldquocathartic. The story it tells is of world events, but also his own le. Part of it happens back home, in Glasgow, with his partner, Caron, who has stuck with him through his repeated disappearances ndash a fact he says is ldquoamazing. Recently, he says, he overheard Caron talking about how miserable he was because he was waiting for a visa to go out to Iraq. If hersquos not there when something is happening, she observes, hersquos always miserable.ldquoI remember talking to Marie Colvin about that, he says. ldquoMarie was the worstsomething was happening where. Even when she was on a job she was thinking of the next job. Anditrsquos a part of the world yoursquore really familiar with ndash Afghanistan or Israel-Palestine ndash itrsquos twice as bad. ##Did he ever think about doing anything   ldquoNot really. Once I got into it that was it. The experience of arriving in Nicaragua at dawn, swaying palm trees, and humidity and crickets. Straight out of Graham Greene. Wonderful. You canrsquot go back from that, really. #####The Glasgow Film Festival premiere screening of Pictures From Afghanistan followed by a QA with David Pratt, chaired by Allan Little, is at the Glasgow Film Theatre on Sunday, March , at .pm.

It isnrsquot about whether you want a left-wing or right-wing BBC, or whether you think the BBC supports or opposes your view of Brexit, Scottish independence or any other isive issue.Nor is the question about whether you believe the BBC holds some sacred position in British society ndash like the NHS ndash or whether you want the sacred cow slain.The question is posed purely in terms of the enjoyment ndash the worth, the value, the fun ndash you get from the BBC. As a consumer, a viewer, a punter, a critic, does the BBC mean much to you any more  Long gone are the days when the BBC was basically all we had and so by default was the centre of cultural le. Wersquore media-rich now, and time-poor.When you weigh the BBC, and judge it, does the broadcaster ndash as its founder Lord Reith promised it would do ndash still ldquoinform, educate and entertain you  Andit does, is the BBC doing it better than its many rivals Our crowded broadcasting landscape means therersquos no longer a place for BBC exceptionalism. It has to earn its place like everyone . Among  to -year-olds, the BBC struggles to remain relevant. Less than half of that key demographic watch it, boding ill for the future.The BBCrsquos back is against the wall. In our increasingly ided society, people of all political persuasions believe the channel is partisan. The left and right both hate it. Hardline Scottish nationalists and hardline Brexiters detest the BBC ndash itrsquos either part of a treacherous pro-union conspiracy, or in league with Brussels.After the criticism Boris Johnson rightly got for dodging tough interviews during the General Election, the Prime Minister seems ready to come for the BBCrsquos licence fee now. Therersquos speculation about it being replaced with an opt-in subscription model like Netflix.Of course, given that this is Britain in , the debate around the BBCrsquos future will degenerate into yet another front in our endless culture wars and produce much heat but little light ndash like a s TV set.One side will say that any threat to the BBC will see Britainrsquos media landscape turn American, with right-wing propagandists fronting channels like Fox News. The other side will say the BBC is unfairly propped up by taxpayers to the detriment of other media outlets, skewing British cultural le.The future of the BBC will be determined on purely political grounds ndash which is very strange. The BBC must be the only media institution in any democracy which is judged by a political yardstick. Everything  in the media landscape ndash radio, print, cinema, TV, online ndash is judged on much more simple criteria: do people like it and are they happy to pay for it So letrsquos judge the BBC on purely critical grounds. Letrsquos set aside the political wrangle ndash and letrsquos address this central question:the broadcaster vanished tomorrow, would you care in terms of the value and entertainment it brings you As the screw began tightening on the BBC, Irsquove started to monitor my own consumption of its programming. I wanted to see just how important it was in my le. Would I be happy without it I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the BBC plays a much smaller role in my le than I thought. Full disclosure: Irsquove worked for the BBC, and Irsquom also one of those liberal types who has spoken of the BBC as an essential pillar of British le. So, I thought when I began studying my own viewing and listening habits, that given my background the BBC would be both the journalistic and entertainment mainstay of my le. Itrsquos not.My household is media-hungry. We take nearly every TV service there is: terrestrial TV, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Sky TV, Apple TV. Wersquove got Alexas in most rooms so we can listen to radio. The house is filled with books, newspapers and magazines. Wersquore happy to pay for media.However, the question is then raised: am I happy with the way Irsquom required to pay for the BBC, compared to how I pay for other media  Would the public be better servedwe could choose the parts of the BBC we wish to pay for These questions come increasingly into focus for me as I find the BBC taking up an ever diminishing sliver of my le. The same seems to be true for many other members of the public.Just look at whatrsquos happening with the BBCrsquos news channel. Of all the services the corporation provides, this is the one I most respect. Itrsquos dependable, impartial, informative. However, like the BBCrsquos drama and comedy output, which is threatened by both homegrown competitors Channel  and international media such as Netflix, the news service is under pressure from viewers consuming current affairs online via sites like Facebook.The reach of the BBC News channel is declining. In the second quarter of , it had  million viewers. Five years previously, there were  million.When it comes to the most popular TV channel, as of September , it was Channel  with a % positivity rating. BBC was second with %, then ITV with %.I find myself agreeing with the public. Itrsquos been a long time since Irsquove watched the BBCrsquos Six OrsquoClock News. I wait for Channel  news at pm. Itrsquos smarter, more international, more in-depth. If I had to pick the channel I get most value from itrsquos Channel . But Channel  isnrsquot put on a pedestal. It provides public service broadcasting and itrsquos commercially self-funded.Irsquod certainly miss BBC Newsnight, in particular the reporting of Emily Maitlis, televisionrsquos best journalist. As to the rest of BBC TVrsquos news and current affairs therersquos not much I couldnrsquot live without. Irsquod certainly survive without the clickbait of Question Time. In Scotland, STVrsquos Scottish news is as good,not better, than BBC Scotland.Radio is a dferent matter. Irsquom very fond of BBC radio. I love Radio  music, I like a bit of Radio rsquos Jo Whiley in the background when Irsquove chores to do, and Irsquom a Radio  fan. One programme Irsquod really miss is Radio rsquos In Our Time with Melvyn Bragg ndash the best and cleverest talk show ever made, I reckon. If the BBC vanished, though, could I happily survive on podcasts and commercial radio, which I find myself increasingly listening to  Probably.The one part of the BBC Irsquod hate to lose is BBC Four. Its documentary output is excellent. From populist history shows fronted by Lucy Worsley and the channelrsquos Friday night music documentaries, to erudite and in-depth explorations of art and science, BBC Four ndash for me at least ndash fulfils the pledge to educate, entertain and inform. Butthe BBC was to disappear, alternatives do exist ndash Sky Arts and a plethora of documentary channels.However, BBC Four is the broadcasterrsquos least-watched channel. In , BBC One had a reach of  million, Channel   million, BBC Two  million, Channel   million, ITV  million. BBC Four had a reach of  million, putting it in the same fighting weight as ITV and Dave.Perhaps thatrsquos because the upstart Netflix has got into documentaries in a big way. The BBCrsquos Storyville strand was once the gold standard of TV documentary making, but these daysyou want to watch an Oscar-winning documentary, or a documentary thatrsquos going to show you things yoursquove never seen before, then Netflix is the place to go. And, of course, therersquos Channel rsquos acclaimed factual output as well, which also easily rivals the BBC.The most remarkable water-cooler documentary of the last year was Tell Me Who I Am on Netflix ndash charting the story of the lives of two adult male twins, one of whom had lost their memory, while the other lived with the knowledge of the history of abuse they had suffered as children.For me, itrsquos BBC One I could really do without. I find its drama output poor, its light entertainment toe-curling. For light entertainment, I head to Channel . If I want something relatively mindless, Irsquoll opt for Gogglebox or First Dates rather than Strictly Come Dancing.In terms of BBC drama, even Line Of Duty or Bodyguard ndash which critics responded to asShakespeare had risen from the grave ndash are in my opinion just cliche-riddled cop shows.If I want original drama then Irsquoll likely turn to Channel  once again, or Netflix, Amazon Prime or Sky with their streaming box sets. You donrsquot get great long-form TV drama on the BBC. A series like Killing Eve is a rarity. HBO is the global hub of the best TV drama, with a pedigree of refined and intelligent programming like The Wire, Six Feet Under and The Sopranos.If you want to watch a great blockbuster series like Game Of Thrones ndash also from HBO ndash then yoursquore more likely to find it on Sky Atlantic than the BBC. A new comedy  Netflix is where Irsquoll look.Therersquos something quintessentially middle-class, middle-aged and middle-brow about BBC drama and comedy. If you distilled BBC drama down into one show it would probably look like Last Tango In Halax. Itrsquos a family saga set in Yorkshire. Itrsquos relatively entertaining, a sort of Cold Feet meets All Creatures Great And Small. Itrsquos cosy ndash as edgy as a butter kne.Channel  drama reflects British le back to viewers in a much more sophisticated way, while Netflix takes you all over the world in a kaleidoscope of genres. Therersquos German thrillers, French horror, Brazilian sci-fi, Belgium cop shows, American comedies, Israeli spy dramas. Itrsquos unusual for me now to watch a long-running show unless itrsquos on Netflix.For films, we never choose the BBC or any other terrestrial channel. We search Sky Cinema, Netflix and Amazon. Why wait until pm to watch a movie on the BBC when you can stream the same movie right now from another service No-one in my house is that interested in sport, but itrsquos how wersquove chosen to opt out of sports programming thatrsquos important, in terms of how the BBC offers its services. With our household Sky package wersquove said no to the sports subscription. Our children are now adults, so wersquove long cancelled the subscription to kidsrsquo programming. Wersquove modelled our Sky subscription around what we like as a family: drama, comedy, films and documentaries.Choice is often hugely overrated ndash just think of all those hours yoursquove spent scrolling through Netflix trying to find something to watch but bewildered by choice. However, flexibility in choosing what you pay for is only fair. Sky understands that I donrsquot like sport so makes it possible for me to buy the bits I want, and discard the bits I donrsquot. The BBC doesnrsquot get it ndash yet.Why canrsquot I pay for the BBCrsquos documentaries, its quizzesand radio ndash and dump the rest  I donrsquot want soaps, terrible Saturday night shows, and mediocre dramas. Irsquom also happy to pay for BBC news. The full-spectrum hatred that BBC news gets proves that in terms of journalism itrsquos doing its job.However, the rest of the BBCrsquos output isnrsquot for me. So reduce my licence fee accordingly. Netflix and Sky have flexible packages, why not the BBC  A flexible BBC subscription fee doesnrsquot immediately mean an end to all Government support. Some state funding could remain. But thatrsquos another discussion.From April, the licence fee will be pound. a year. Make my payment proportional to my consumption. If I want to opt into everything, fine, charge me the full pound.. If I want a slimmed-down package, then charge me a fair share. Netflix, for example, charges for three dferent packages: Basic at pound. per month, Standard at pound., and Premium at pound..Unlike every other media outlet, the BBC doesnrsquot woo me for my money, it demands my money. The others earn it, they persuade me to part with my cash ndash and they donrsquot have the law on their side threatening court.I always thought Irsquod remain a loyal BBC subject. But Irsquom starting to rebel. I donrsquot want to be a subject any longer. Irsquod like to take control of what I pay for. So, in answer to the question I posed myself ndash does the BBC really matter  ndash Irsquom increasingly leaning towards the answer: sadly, less and less.The media landscape has changed ndash but the BBC hasnrsquot. The result is that while once I truly thought I couldnrsquot imagine a world without the BBC, Irsquom coming to the unhappy conclusion that although I wouldnrsquot want to do without the BBC completely,I had to give it up, I could as there are plenty of good alternatives out there now.The only way the BBC can win back people like me is for the broadcaster to change and enter the st century before itrsquos too late."},{"url":null,"title":"jimmy-reid-inside-mind-working-class-hero","story":"JIMMY Reid was haunted by memories of desperate poverty all his le. His early childhood in the Glasgow Gorbals slums, where three of his sisters died in infancy, drove him to fight to improve the lot of working-class people.Born into severe poverty in , Reid was drawn to radical politics as a way to bring about social reform, his heroic efforts for social change earning him the title ldquothe best MP Scotland never had.His passion and charisma, allied to a fearless ability for public speaking, made people from all walks of le sit up and listen ndash eventhey didnrsquot necessarily agree with him.Now a new biography traces Reidrsquos remarkable le from a poverty-stricken background in Glasgow to being thrown into the national limelight as the spokesman for the Upper Clyde Shipbuildersrsquo work-in.The authors of Jimmy Reid: A Clyde-built Man, who will be appearing at the Aye Write! festival next month, interviewed family members, friends and comrades, as well as delving into the University of Glasgow archives to shed new light on how Reid became a symbol of working-class defiance.ldquoWe were bowled over by the audacity of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders shop stewards and by Reidrsquos role as leader and political icon in his own right, and he was arguably one of the greatest political orators since , said Dr William Knox, honorary senior lecturer in Scottish history at the University of St Andrews.His co-author, Professor Alan McKinlay, professor of human resource management at Newcastle University Business School, said: ldquoI was a schoolboy when the UCS work-in happened between  and , and we were one of the schools that collected money for the shipyard workers.ldquoMy dad worked at Rolls-Royce and, like the UCS men, had faced redundancy, and I admired these audacious men who stood up to market forces.Researching the book uncovered some startling revelations about the man who, along with fellow shop stewards Jimmy Airlie, Sammy Gilmore and Sammy Barr, led and won a major industrial struggle.For McKinlay, one of the most striking aspects of Reidrsquos le that emerged from the research was how intensely personal his politics were.ldquoThe image that stayed in my mind was of Jimmy as a young boy watching his father cradle his dying sister in his arms just as midnight struck on Hogmanay and Auld Lang Syne rang out in the streets outside, he said.To Reid, his three infant sisters ldquohad been murdered ndash whatever it said in the death certicate, they should have put down lsquosocial conditionsrsquo as the cause.ldquoHis visceral personal politics came down to this bedrock of morality, said McKinlay.ldquoIt was the devastating impact of poverty and the desire to eradicate it that shaped his politics from an early age, he added. ldquoEven in his last years he never ceased to be emotional when the bells rang out to announce the arrival of the New Year.When the family moved to Govan, their circumstances improved and Reid did well at St Gerardrsquos Senior Secondary, where he was streamed for university and read widely. Once asked by Jonathan Miller, the theatre director, at which university hersquod been educated Reid told him: ldquoGovan public library.Despite his obvious intelligence, Reid left school at  as his ldquoexpectations never involved higher education. I did not know anybody who went to university from the streets of Govan, he would say.Knox was struck by Reidrsquos contradictory nature ndash a product of the macho culture of the shipyards who loved cricket and played the saxophone.ldquoI was surprised to learn that Reid started his working le in a stockbrokerrsquos office, where his employer recognised his ability, said Knox.The young communist firebrand struck up a rapport with the senior partner who promised him a bright career as a future partnerhe stayed on, but Reidrsquos socialist convictions were incompatible with working in a stockbroking firm.However, this early training proved invaluable as it gave him an understanding of the workings of finance capital. He said: ldquoIrsquove always been able to read the stock exchange, and in debates with people it has become quite useful.Reid signed up as an engineering apprentice in the Govan shipyards, but the Scottish shipping industry was already in decline. There were  shipyards on the Clyde in  but by  only nine remained.In , the Heath government attempted to close Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, which had been merged from five yards.Refused further state support, UCS was forced into liquidation despite the yards having a full order book and a forecasted profit for . The shop stewards, including Reid, came up with the idea of a work-in rather than a strike, which would hand victory to the government.They would have ldquocheered us out of the yards, said Reid. ldquoIf we go out on strike, once wersquore out on the street, theyrsquoll padlock the gates. Wersquoll have done their job for them.ldquoThe University of Glasgow archives gave us access to tape recordings of the shop stewardsrsquo private meetings, said McKinlay. ldquoThey were very conscious that what they were doing was unprecedented, and that they were taking on a huge burden that they couldnrsquot mess up.ldquoThe humour of these men really came through ndash that rough, caustic Glasgow humour. People often underestimated Reid because of this sense of humour, and when they heard his accent. But behind all that was an intellect and a breadth of learning.Reidrsquos intelligence and oratorical powers came to the fore during the work-in, and his electrying address to the workforce became famous: ldquoTherersquos a basic elementary right invoked here ndash thatrsquos our right to work. Wersquore no strikers. We are responsible people and we will conduct ourselves with dignity and discipline. There will be no hooliganism. There will be no vandalism. There will be no bevvying, because the world is watching us.The subsequent government climbdown was viewed as a tremendous victory, but the responsibility for saving the livelihoods of thousands of families took its toll on Reid, who was twice admitted to hospital. His daughter Eileen told the authors he was ldquopublic property ... we hardly ever saw him ... our whole lives were taken over ... no normal stuff like going to the swimming baths.His widow Joan said: ldquoHe always whistled coming up the stairs. Andhe wasnrsquot whistling then you knew something was wrong. He never whistled during the work-in.Despite being a household name after helping to save around , jobs, Reid was rejected when he stood as an MP for Central Dunbartonshire. He left the Communist Party but was also defeated in Dundee East as a Labour candidate in  by the SNP and began a career as a columnist and broadcaster. Disillusioned by New Labour, he resigned from the party in  and joined the SNP in .When Reid died in , Govan shipyard workers lined the road as his cortege went past. At his funeral, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: ldquoThe fact there is still a shipbuilding industry in Scotland today is in large measure because of the inspirational campaigns that he waged.McKinlay said: ldquoIf his le had a message it was that morality rather than economics should be the bedrock of policymaking.bullWilliam Knox and Alan McKinlay will discuss Jimmy Reid: A Clyde-built Man at Aye Write! on Sunday, March  at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"climate-comment-can-bit-meet-net-zero","story":"A ldquoclimate emergency needs a robust response. According to the philosopher Peter Springer, developed countries like the UK have an ethical duty to lead the world out of this crisis. After all, the UK has been partially responsible for creating the problem through its past actions. Much of its financial and intellectual capital base has been constructed on a legacy of environmental damage. It needs to put this right.The UK Government is committed to taking the country to net zero by  following the Committee on Climate Changersquos recommendation and analysis of the pathways to net zero. But the committee was also clear that there are huge policy challenges associated with meeting this objective.One of the most sobering aspects of the report from the Committee on Climate Change is the fact that we need to decarbonise the economy across all sectors simultaneously. It isnrsquot good enough to think we can do a little bit of this and then a little bit of that. The scale of this challenge is truly daunting not just for those who need to plan and implement these changes but for every single citizen. This will affect everybodyrsquos le. As I have said before, there is no point putting a bung in the tail pipe of a metaphorical car to stop its emissions without re-engineering, and perhaps even re-imagining, the car itself.Even though government has established a clear national objective, nobody should imagine that this is someone rsquos problem. It is not, as often implied, for government alone to deliver the changes which are needed. The government needs to play its part but there is a job for everybody and for every organisation and business. For example,every decision we make, from buying food in the local supermarket to deciding where to go on holiday, was informed by information about the environmental costs of the dferent options, we could probably make a massive and instantaneous dference. Many people already do this when deciding how much meat they eat, but this is just a start. Even small, almost imperceptible nudges to our decisions could be transformative. Government need to make sure we all have this information and, once delivered, we all have an ethical duty to take it into account.This is why I have taken on the job of leading the aspiration of the University of St Andrews to reach net zero in its own business within the time scales set by government. This university has adopted net zero as part of its strategy and make it a corporate responsibility. My job is to hold it to account and help it to reach its objective.Like any organisation, the university is going to find this dficult. It has already done much to reduce its carbon footprint, but there is only so much it can do on its own. Carbon, and other environmental impacts like water use, permeate almost everything the university does. Wringing the carbon and water out is going to take determination, smart decision-making and imaginative business practice.A university has a special role in the mission to achieve net zero. Apart from being an exemplar to normal businesses, it moulds the future through the research it does and the people it trains. It has global influence through its networks of academics and can itself be a living laboratory for exploring the kind of actions and technical fixes which demonstrate feasibility. A university is not just a crucible for the creation of new ideas but also an integrated part of delivering these ideas to meet the national objectives. It has an opportunity to create impact which is much greater than its size.Sir Ian Boyd is a professor of biology at the University of St Andrews and former Chief Scientic Adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"},{"url":null,"title":"eastenders-anniversary-35-years-hatches-matches-dispatches-rebirths-shape-shifting","story":"A cynic might say the comebacks occur when either the scriptwriters have run out of plotlines or the actors, who set out chasing that Hollywood role, stage or music opportunity, realise that their bread, thick white sliced, is better buttered in Albert Square.Some, of course, never reappear because, that cynic again, their ratings or focus group visibility doesnrsquot cut it.With  deaths in the place since the launch in , the Square is surely the most hazardous place on Earth, more dangerous than Chicago in the thirties or Caracas today.

But they wonrsquot be staying in cosy chalets, as accommodation will be mountaineers huts ndash ldquobothy-like, in the words of one organiser ndash where home comforts are hard to find.But while the facilities may offer the authentic Scottish climbing experience, nerves have been frayed waiting for the weather to play its part.A relatively warm December and January over Scotlandrsquos high ground had meant that the festival was facing poor conditions in gullies and clfs, which are normally cloaked in the snow and ice that makes them an international draw in winter for the worldrsquos mountaineers.But as the weather worsens for everyone , for the mountaineers conditions are improving as the cold, wind and wet moves in.Simon Richardson, one of Scotlandrsquos foremost winter climbers who sits on the organising committee for the festival, said: ldquoParticipants of the International Winter Meet have been anxiously watching the Scottish weather for several weeks now. After the warm December and January the prospects for winter climbing looked bleak.ldquoFortunately, the February conveyor belt of westerly storms has changed all that. There is plenty of snow across the Highlands, and ice is building rapidly. Ben Nevis and the mountains of Glen Coe are ice-making machines that love frequent blizzards and rapid temperature fluctuations.ldquoThe soft aerated Scottish ice occurs in very few parts of the world and is a delight to climb, and ice climbs in Scotland are highly sought after by International climbers.He added: ldquoThis weather trend looks set to continue through the week of the meet, and winter climbers from both the UK and overseas are looking forward to some superb ice-climbing conditions.The winter meet started in  and ran for  years. The last meet was held by the British Mountaineering Council in , but this yearrsquos revival, led by Mountaineering Scotland, recognises the key role that the event has played on the world mountaineering stage, bringing climbers together to share ideas and form new plans.Richardson said: ldquoThe spin-offs of winter meets have been huge. Regardless of the weather, all the meets have been hugely successful and have become a key event in the mountaineering calendar. International partnerships have formed and climbers have shared techniques and equipment. The meet has also helped shape the ethics of world mountaineering.ldquoAt the turn of this century, dry tooling was all the rage ndash highly gymnastic climbing using ice tool and crampons ndash but these routes required extensive preparation with drilled holds and were protected by bolts.ldquoThe Scottish ethic of climbing routes from the ground up and on sight, and not drilling holes in the rock, was in direct contrast to this and, after visiting Scotland, many visitors understood our ethic and have started to apply this more aesthetic approach in other parts of the world.Partnerships formed on the meets have resulted in dozens of important new routes across the world, and helped push mountaineering to new frontiers.Richardson added: ldquoPerhaps the most striking example of this was the first winter conditions ascent of the North Face of North Twin in the Canadian Rockies [which is] higher and steeper than the Eiger and one of the most formidable alpine walls in the world.ldquoIt was climbed by Steve House of the USA and Marko Prezelj from Slovenia in , where they used Scottish approach. Both climbers met on the Scottish winter meet.ldquoSeveral of the worldrsquos greatest ascents in recent years have derived from partnerships created at the winter meet. The most recent example is the UKrsquos Tom Livingstone and Alescaron Cesen and Luka Stra#ar, both Slovenian, who met on the last winter meet in .ldquoIn August , they made the first ascent of the North Face of Latok I in the Karakoram ndash one of the most coveted prizes in world mountaineering. The route was first attempted in  and had defeated  subsequent expeditions. They were awarded the Piolets drsquoOr, the highest honour in mountaineering, for their ascent.During the week, climbers will stay in some of Scotlandrsquos most famous winter climbing arenas, including the Cairngorms, Lochaber and Glen Coe, being accommodated in mountaineering huts such as the famous Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut beneath the massive clfs on the north face of Ben Nevis.The event is being staged with the help of the Scottish Mountaineering Club , the Alpine Club and the British Mountaineering Council, and is sponsored by clothing and equipment manufacturer Salewa.John Fowler, president of the SMC, which owns three of the huts accommodating climbers, said: ldquoThe Scottish Mountaineering Club is delighted to contribute to this international event and welcomes the opportunity to showcase the impressive nature of Scottish winter climbing to some of the best mountaineers from home and abroad.All abilities are represented, with climbers from Israel and South Africa, who have little opportunity to climb snow and ice in their own countries, through to regular winter climbers from Europe, Scandinavia and North America.Host climbers from the UK have been selected to match the abilities of the international mountaineers.These include Paul Ramsden, one of the worldrsquos most accomplished mountaineers and three times winner of the Piolets drsquoOr ndash mountaineeringrsquos highest award.The groups will rotate around each of the locations to ensure everyone gets to experience the ied terrain Scotland can offer.Stuart Younie, chief executive of Mountaineering Scotland, said: ldquoWe want to give the climbers as authentic a Scottish mountaineering experience as possible. In previous years, they would have stayed in a hotel and been based in one place, but here they are staying in the huts right on the doorstep of incredible mountaineering locations.ldquoIrsquod describe the huts as one step up from a bothy.

It then charged nothing for two years before last year introducing annual fees of pound. in addition to floating a now-abandoned idea of discontinuing the service.Elsewhere in the Lothians, West Lothian went from charging nothing up to   to imposing fees of pound, while in East Lothian fees went from zero to pound in the same year.The impact this is having on pupil participation has been laid bare in the Improvement Service report, which showed that while overall learner numbers dropped by five per cent between   and the current school year, in some charging authorities they plummeted by close to %.In Aberdeen, where the cost of group lessons has fallen from pound to pound but the cost of inidual tuition has risen from pound to pound, pupil numbers have almost halved from , to ,, although the council said that can be partially explained by a change in the way the data is collected.In West Lothian, meanwhile, learner numbers fell by % year-on-year while in Midlothian they fell by %, and in East Lothian by %.History shows that pupil numbers tend to bounce back in the years following a large drop-off, but concerns have been raised about the impact this is having on the demographics of the children being given the opportunity to learn. Those whose parents can afford to pay and those who are granted a concession because they are in receipt of free school meals tend to fill the spaces, but there is an emerging group of pupils in the middle who are being squeezed out of lessons completely.ldquoTherersquos a chasm in the middle where parents will be choosing between getting their car MOTrsquod or paying for music lessons, said North Lanarkshire percussion teacher Kirk Richardson. ldquoThese are people with jobs, who could pay years ago but now canrsquot afford it.ldquoTherersquos a whole middle section there who wersquore not looking after and thatrsquos the sad bit.Some schools are taking action to ensure that group is not squeezed out completely, with the headteacher at Newbattle High School in Midlothian using general school funds to ensure every childrsquos lessons are paid for them.However, Midlothian woodwind teacher Fiona Gray said that while this is an ldquohonourable thing to do, she noted that it is creating as unlevel a playing field within the local authority area as already exists across council boundaries.ldquoNewbattle is in a catchment where lots of children are falling in the middle and are not eligible for free lessons, she said.ldquoTherersquos a bursary scheme but you have to be below a certain level to get it. A lot of pupils are just above that level but their parents canrsquot afford to pay.ldquoThe headteacher is for very honourable reasons paying for all instrumental lessons for all pupils, which is wonderful, but we donrsquot have an equal and fair playing field for pupils in other schools.In the Western Isles, the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is also introducing measures designed to ensure its music service can be maintained at as low a cost as possible, with the council currently only charging for lessons in stringed instruments. Its solution is to make use of its digital learning hub e-sgoil, which sees pupils across the area get face-to-face lessons at least once a month with the remainder provided via video link.Other authorities are taking the Western Islesrsquo lead, with Orkney and Argyll  Bute already using some form of digital learning while Highland, Aberdeenshire and West Lothian are considering it. Dumfries  Galloway, which will look at proposals to axe instrument tuition completely when it meets later this week, is also contemplating an e-sgoil-type approach, although Andrew OrsquoHalloran, local secretary of the EIS union, said the solution is considered to be far from perfect.ldquoWersquove made it quite clear to the local authority that the technology has to be right first, he said. ldquoThe costs involved in introducing a technology solution would be far greater in the first year than the savings [they would make]they cut teachers or introduced charging. That model would be a long-term solution.The reason charging exists at all is that musical instrument tuition is not classed a core part of the education curriculum, meaning the Scottish Government does not provide funding for it as part of its local authority settlement. Though the Government has repeatedly said it expects councils to make music lessons free at the point of delivery, because they are classed as discretionary authorities are free to fund them as they see fit ndash or to scrap them altogetherthat suits their budgetary plans.Campaigner Ralph Riddiough, a lawyer and community musician from Ayrshire, has mounted a legal challenge to the Governmentrsquos position that music lessons are non-core, which,successful, would put the responsibility on the Government to fund tuition for children across Scotland. The Government is due to respond to his challenge at the beginning of next month.Regardless of what that response says, Mr Vipond ndash and everyone  campaigning to safeguard the provision of music lessons in Scottish schools ndash believes the Government must now step up to the mark, class music tutors as teachers who are integral to the education system and fund the service they provide.ldquoThe Curriculum for Excellence is supposed to be about educating the whole child you canrsquot just pick and choose who gets the chance to have a full education, Mr Vipond said.ldquoItrsquos a real shame that this has become a postcode lottery and the Government saying it should be free but itrsquos up to the councils to pay for it is not fair. Theyrsquore washing their hands of the issue.ldquoThey are under a lot of pressure but this is our future.

One end of the ground is a rock face so fans are advised to pack crampons the other looks down on the city below. It was designed by Eduardo Souto de Moura for a relatively modest pound million and he won architecturersquos biggest prize for it.The two stands on either side of the pitch are covered with a canopy-style roof and connected by dozens of steel strings, a design inspired by ancient South American Incan bridges.

During the week he circulated a gem from another fan, Grant, aka@unicornunbound, who had come across an old letter from an unlikely Arabs fan, the bestselling writer James A Michener.Michener wrote a slew of meaty sagas, including the one on which the musical South Pacic was based, but before, and a mite prosaically, he had studied at St Andrews University for two years in the early s. Every second Saturday he crossed the Tay to support Dundee United, then in the Second Division. They were, he wrote, his kind of team ndash ldquobrash, brawling and brave.He would have seen them take on the mighty Armadale, St Bernardrsquos and Borsquoness, although they were pulling in crowds of ,, including the young James, for local derbies against Montrose and Forfar. Going to see Dundee, then in the First Division, was too expensive so the US student had settled on United.Michener said he followed United for two years and part of the third but was ldquodoomed never to see them advance into the higher ision, but my loyalty remained permanent. He did follow them from afar, too, when he became successful.The author wasnrsquot there for the glory days under the carnaptious Jim McLean when United won the league and might also have won the European Cup had Roma not bunged the referee pound, in the semi-final with the Arabs ahead - from the first leg.Therersquos a play about McLean at the Dundee Rep now called Smile, which Jim never did. Irsquod like to see it reviewed by Duncan Ferguson who, when disciplined by his boss and ordered to paint a gym wall, daubed ldquoJim McLeanrsquos a c***.Or John Barnes who, in the wee curmudgeonrsquos last act at the club, banjoed the BBC reporter.But finally on the mighty club.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The second advert, due to be screened in the spring, will showcase Orkney’s lestyle, along with work and study opportunities in the county.The adverts comprise footage created by Orkney-based digital content agency, Start Point Media, as part of the Digital Media Orkney Project, a three-year Orkney Marketing Programme initiative funded by LEADER, Highlands and Islands Enterpriseand Orkney Islands Council .Editing and advert composition was undertaken by STV as part of its Growth Fund initiative, aimed at encouraging Scottish businesses and organisations to advertise on the channel.Morag Robertson, economic development officer at OIC, said: “We decided to create these impactful television adverts with the backing of STV’s Growth Fund and the LEADER programme, as a complement to our marketing activities and as a way of driving more visitors to the official Orkney website, Orkney. It’s the main portal now for our visitor information, and the place anyone keen to learn more about living, working and studying in the islands should head, so we felt a TV campaign would be a great way to both highlight the site and everything Orkney has to offer.”“We’re really delighted with the quality of the two adverts,” added Maureen Shearer, development manager at HIE in Orkney. “The feedback on the first, focusing on Orkney as a visitor destination, has been fantastic and we’re already seeing an increase in the hits on the Orkney website.

It acknowledged that Orkney’s internal ferry services fell short of minimum standards in terms of cost, reliability, frequency and accessibility.

To that end, hearing huge news tonight that the Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament have agreed to our request for an inquiry into diplomatic immunity and extradition. ##mdash Radd SeigerFebruary , Earlier this month, the Foreign Office said they had ldquono plans to launch a public inquiry into the case ndash saying the case had been handled ldquoproperly and lawfully throughout.The teenager was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car driven by Mrs Sacoolas outside a US military base in Northamptonshire on August  last year.Mrs Sacoolas, the -year-old we of an intelligence official based at RAF Croughton, was granted diplomatic immunity after the crash and sparked international controversy after being allowed toto her home country.She was later charged with causing Mr Dunnrsquos death by dangerous driving.Mr Dunnrsquos mother, Charlotte Charles and father, Tim Dunn, said they were told by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab that the Government was ldquoreviewing all our options after Mr Pompeorsquos refusal to extradite Mrs Sacoolas.Speaking about Mr Assangersquos potential extradition to the US, Mr Seiger said: ldquoHarry Dunnrsquos family understand and respect the importance of extradition procedures between nations and the huge public interest that attaches to extradition.ldquoNo one is above the law and no one must be allowed to evade justicethey manage to flee a country, whether diplomat or not.ldquoThat said, in refusing the UKrsquos perfectly lawful request to extradite Anne Sacoolas, and not even following the legal and judicial process the US UK Treaty calls for, the US has launched the single greatest attack on the so called special relationship between the countries in modern memory.Mr Seiger continued: ldquoThe US is not behaving like an ally and has effectively thumbed its nose up at the UK and ignored the clearly laid out provisions in the treaty, effectively tearing it up.ldquoThe principle of reciprocity is at the core of any extradition treaty. Despite its disgraceful refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the US continues to seek the extradition of people in the UK such as Julian Assange.ldquoIn doing so, they are demonstrating an extraordinary amount of hypocrisy and the double standards on display are unprecedented.ldquoThe US needs to be brought firmly back into line on the international stage and be made to understand that they are not going to have their way. vw,vw,px, px\"Julian Assangersquos full extradition hearing is due to begin next week Mr Seigerrsquos comments followed Saturdayrsquos protest in which hundreds of Assangersquos supporters marched through London ahead of next weekrsquos full extradition hearing.Calling for the Government to block the extradition request, Mr Seiger said: ldquoIn accordance with the principle of reciprocity which the US is failing to abide by, on behalf of Harry Dunnrsquos family and the millions of concerned citizens in the UK, I now demand that the UK authorities block any further extraditions to the US, including the one of Julian Assange, until such time as Anne Sacoolas is extradited and back on UK soil facing the justice system here.ldquoDominic Raab told us when we met with him on January  that lsquowe are reviewing all our optionsrsquo following the refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas.ldquoI now call him to exercise that option of refusing to extradite Julian Assange and others to the USA.ldquoIt is high time that the UK Government comes out and shows us what they are made ofthey are to instil any confidence that they really do have our backs, Harryrsquos family having been so badly let down following his death last August.Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.” Responding to the murders of at least nine people in Hanau, Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were clear signs that the killer had been motivated by racism.Merkel, of the centre-right CDU party, has been described by some as the new ‘leader of the free world’ because of her strong stance against the sinister ideology espoused by those such as the far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Echoing Russia’s Vladimir Putin, he has declared “the age of liberal democracy is at an end” on the grounds that it is no longer able to “provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture”. Normally the US President is the unofficial leader of the free world, but Donald Trump, quite accurately, views Orban as “probably like me”.: Andrew Sabisky: what the former No.  adviser is alleged to have said about pregnancies, eugenics and race as he steps down: Boris Johnson is not a ‘real racist’ despite Brits criticism, says Home Secretary Priti PatelFor Orban, the Christian culture of Europe is under threat from “Muslim invaders” and there is, and always will be, a great iding line between these two religions. He is right about one thing, but wrong about everything .There is indeed a iding line that separates human beings, not just in Europe, but all over the world. On one side of this line are groups like Isis but also far-right killers such as one in Hanau another who massacred  people in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year and the man who killed  people in attacks in Oslo and the island of Utoya in Norway in .The fascists may view the ‘Islamofascists’ as their deadly enemies, but they are fundamentally the same. Disagree with them too much and they will kill you belong to the wrong group and they will kill you.On the other side are the vast majority of people – of all religions and none – who are decent, peace-loving and respectful of others’ basic right to exist.Racism and other forms of bigotry are ideological mechanisms, societal poisons, that can persuade people to cross this line into a le of violence, murder and death.So , on playing a word association game, you say “terrorist” on hearing “Muslim”, beware, because you are heading in a dangerous direction.The basic premise of liberalism – the prevailing philosophy of all true democracies – is that each and every one of us is an inidual. It is, therefore, the antidote to the poison of prejudice.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how to stay rational about coronavirus in the face of panic dr antonis kousoulis","story":"The Covid- coronavirus outbreak may feel scary to some, but it is important to retain a sense of perspective and seek out reputable sources of information, writes Dr Antonis Kousoulis.The UK is a bit on edge at the moment. Following hot on the heels of Brexit, we’ve seen weather challenges, and a news agenda dominated by the Covid- coronavirus outbreak. It’s fair to say public health and climate related emergencies are only likely to become more frequent in the next few years, as environmental and human challenges become more pressing.In the case of the coronavirus, we don’t know yet what will happen.The very best scientists in the world are studying the virus and its impact, and responding appropriately with containment, treatment and advice. We don’t know what that will mean for the UK and the wider world - how the disease will develop, whether it will spread and what the implications will be for our ability to stay healthy, to work, to visit people and to move around freely.Uncertainty breeds concern – and several mental health helplines are getting calls about the virus. We worry about change, and about things we can’t control. There is a lot of information and advice out there, some good, and some bad. It is changing all the time, and there is a lot of fake news around. Even health organisations have often taken a very top-down approach with patronising messaging about what people should or should not be doing, instead of properly engaging with the communities that are facing the real stresses.: Man from Heriot Watt University tests negative for coronavirus after advice sent out to students: A coronavirus hoax message is circulating on WhatsApp - here’s what to doyou receive itThe situation may feel scary but panic and stress can cloud our judgement and lead to bad decisions for our health. There are things that you can do to stay mentally healthy.We need to avoid speculation and look up reputable sources on the outbreak. Rumour and speculation fuel anxiety. Some diseases, such as bird-flu, did not develop at all. And not every cold or cough is the coronavirus. Having access to good quality and up-to-date information about the virus can help us feel more in control. You can get up-to-date information and advice on the virus from the NHS, Gov.uk, Health Protection Scotland and Public Health Wales.Find a balanceWe should all be following hygiene advice such as washing hands often, particularly after using public transport or after being in public places, using tissuesyou sneeze or cough and disposing of them, and staying at homeyou are feeling unwell.Not everything you see or hear is going to be true. If you find that the news is stressing you out, it’s important to find a balance. It’s best that you don’t avoid all news and that you keep informing and educating yourself, but limit your news intakeit is bothering you. You might want to mute or turn off news notications or your smartphone or limit your news intake to once a day.At times of stress, we usually work better in company and with support. It is normal to feel vulnerable and overwhelmed as we consume news about the outbreak, especiallywe have experienced trauma or a mental health problem in the past. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings and remind each other to look after our physical and mental health, and avoid increasing habits that are not helpful, like smoking and drinking.Try and keep in touch with your friends and family or contact a helpline for emotional support. You may also like to focus on the things you can doyou feel able to: use stress management and relaxation techniques, keep active and eat a balanced diet.Rumours at schoolOur response to infectious outbreaks, like in mental ill-health, has a history of discriminating against the most vulnerable. It’s really important not to judge people and avoid jumping to conclusions about who is responsible for the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of gender, ethnicity or sex. Being caring and supportive improves the chances of prevention and recovery.Talk to your children and your family and reassure anyone you know who is worried. Involving family and children in plans for mental health is essential. We need to ask children what they have heard about the outbreak and support them. They could have picked up rumours at school. Don’t avoid the “scary topic” but engage in a way that is understandable to them. We have more advice on talking with your children about world news.All around the world, there are epidemiologists and public health doctors whose job it is to look out for patterns in disease. But as the news cycle has become -hour, and our connection to distant world events more and more immediate, there is a very real risk that real, but small threats become hyper magnied in our minds before we have the chance to work out how concerned we should actually be.The critical thing for our mental health is that we gain appropriate perspective and context – without cutting ourselves off from important public health advice.It may be that the coronavirus outbreak burns out. It may join the other four human coronaviruses as a condition which appears and disappears from time to time – or it may become a global threat to public health. Whether it is this agent, or another, there will come a time when we need to be able to receive and respond to urgent public health advice. That includes making sure that we are in our best mental health to be able to act rationally when required.Dr Antonis Kousoulis is a director at the Mental Health Foundation, a medical doctor specialist in public health and a visiting lecturer at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"stormy weather to continue in scotland into next week as new alert issued","story":"The north of the country is to be under a yellow \"snow and ice\" warning until am on Sunday - with separate warnings for wind, snow and rain issued for Monday.The yellow warning for snow affects for every region in the country and will come into effect on Monday between am and pm.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH1402NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 14th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

There is much more ‘going ons’ than merely learning lines and ‘tech’ work as the -strong cast fill the stage and raise the roof with their storming ‘Another Op’nin, Another Show’ number. The pace throughout is fast and crackles along towards the interval as Fred and Lilli lock horns but work to bring the show to le.Matthew Cavan, a familiar face to many as his cabaret drag act alter ego ‘Miss Cherry Ontop’ welcomes the audience to Act Two with a belter rendition of its ‘Too Darn Hot’ as the whole cast weave in and out of the stalls onto the stage. A special mention must go to Marty Maguire and Darren Franklin, two mobsters looking to ‘collect’ but take time to tell the audience to ‘brush up their Shakespeare’ in a classic comedic set piece. Cast and crew’s energy throughout the two hour running time is infectious as we hurtle towards the finale and the question of can or should the ‘Shrew’ be tamed  A timely question for our age.The Lyric and NI Opera’s co-production is a high octane, visually beautul way to kick start the Lyric’s  programme. The ‘Wunder’ bar has been set very high indeed.Kiss Me, Kate runs at the Lyric Theatre until February .

When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-16.02.40.png","title":"healthy food has never been this tasty","story":"YOU could be forgiven for wondering why a new café has opened so close to one of the busiest gyms in West Belfast. After all, who wants a feed after healthy work-out However, Kaff is a café with a dference. Located beneath GymCo in the grounds of the thriving Devenish Complex, Kaff offers a food and drink menu that is very much caterd for those gym-bunnies who hop by it daily.From a range of breakfast items to an all-day brunch, there is something for everyone on the menu – and for those who want a ‘cheat day’, fear not, Kaff offers a selection of freshly-made traybakes too, including caramel squares, raspberry ruffles and chocolate brownies.It was a Thursday lunchtime when myself and two colleagues paid a visit to Kaff, which opened a fortnight ago. We were shown to our table by a friendly and helpful member of staff.We were assured the coffee is very popular, so it would have been rude not to order my favourite, the simple, timeless, classic Cappuccino. An Americano and what I would call proper tea – the one in a pot with tealeaves – completed our drinks order.On to the food and the menu was a challenge – in a really, really good way. You can be as creative as you want using the ever-popular sourdough bread, eggs cooked the way you like them, not to mention salads, sandwiches, smashed avocado and beans.As it was lunchtime, we were drawn to the mouth-watering choices on the main food menu. I was immediately attracted to the ham hock, served with crushed potato, spring onion, spinach, a fried egg and siracha sauce. As someone who’s not exactly a gym regular, the dish was what I would describe as on the middle-range of healthiness.The pulled ham hock was melt-in-your-mouth stuff and full of flavour, perfectly-accompanied by some expertly-cooked potatoes, spinach, spring onion and perfectly fried egg, all bound together with that hot kick of siracha sauce. Every bite was mouth-watering and I would not hesitate in rushing back to Kaff to order again- it was that good. Priced at just £, it was great value for the generous portion.Across the table, a colleague was feeling creative and opted for toasted sourdough, complete with smashed avocado, smoked jalapeno salsa, poacher and black sesame. The dish had an abundance of flavour and he described it as “refreshing” given that nice kick thanks to the jalapeno. You can do a lot with sourdough bread, as you will see in many cafes across Belfast, but Kaff’s offering was unique and clearly a lot of thought was put into it.Our final lunch-goer couldn’t resist trying Kaff’s all-day breakfast – or to put it more factually, “a healthy fry”. It is was not a surprise to learn this is already proving to be a real hit with customers already – and it’s not hard to see why. It was made up of black pudding, beef sausage, grilled bacon, cherry tomatoes and some of the best poached eggs I have ever seen, all served with the aforementioned sourdough bread and smashed avocado.My colleague was particular impressed by the smashed avocado and plans a rapidjust so his better half can give it ago. I have to admit I was kind of jealous when it was brought to the table. For just £, you’d go a long way to find that quality at that value.With our stomachs satisfied, we resisted the temptation to go for an after-lunch traybake, but I was instructed via phone by a colleague back at the office towith a chocolate protein ball, which I was duly informed is essential for that tasty little bit of extra energy to get over the line in the weekly parkrun.Kaff is serving food and drink with a dference. If, like me, you have tended to pull a face whenever you’re hungry and healthy food is mentioned, then,l again like me, you’re in for a very pleasant surprise.Kaff Belfast,- Finaghy Road North,Belfast,Tel:   www.kaffbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day. Lori has this amazing personality she is a very good listener and that is one of her attributes that makes her your favourite TV personality. She presents Join Her at Northern Vision’s NvTv.Lori is not a household name in Northern Ireland’s TV industry but I can bet you my last shilling she is daring and it will not be long before we see a sea of work from hershe decides to work in this media sector. Imagine not having your typical chest thumping, mean drama kings and queens we are used to on our television sets.I would say she is arguably one of the most influential voices in the Black and Minority Ethnic community in all Ireland. Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in . This event provoked hopeless debates in the prelude to the census in England, for example. The ‘crisis’ question was, why would the Scottish and Irish be granted an ethnicity status while the English were left out of this Well, the ethnicity question I am interested in here also brings the African to the table.•Elly Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renewed calls to open historic cemetery","story":"THERE have been renewed calls this week for Belfast City Council to re-open the historic Clton Street Cemetery to the public.The gates at the Henry Place site are locked to the public and can only be accessed by prior arrangement with Council officials.Local Sinn Féin councillor JJ Magee seconded a motion brought by colleague Geraldine McAteer calling out Council for their neglect of the historic graveyard which has led to undergrowth along its perimeter walls and accelerating deterioration of a number of headstones.Speaking to the North Belfast News, JJ Magee said: “We have tourist signs that guide walking tours and visitors from the city centre up to Clton Street Cemetery only for people to find out the gates are closed.“We are pushing Council to get the gates opened and make it a facility for tourists and local people.“I have been disappointed with the slow response from Council so we brought forward this motion to get a report back.“It is a massive asset for the people of Belfast with huge history. It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place. The largest famine grave and largest cholera grave is in there as well as the graves of famous names such as United Irishman Dr William Drennan and the McCracken’s.“I am hoping it gets re-opened so people can learn more about its history.“It is also one of the very few green areas in the district so it would be a huge asset to the local community.“The Council say about costs and health and safety but that can be addressed very easily.”The motion has been referred to next month’s People and Communities Committee to allow time for a report to be brought back by Council officers.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We can’t make any comment until that report has been discussed at the March meeting of the People and Communities Committee, a decision made and subsequently agreed by council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"best home cook producers apologise for tricolour emoji in tweet announcing winner","story":"The tweet FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe tweetFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailProducers of the BBC series Best Home Cook have apologised for using an emoji of an Irish tricolour in a social media post announcing the Northern Ireland winner of the UK-wide culinary competition.The image appeared online on Thursday night in a tweet announcing that Suzie Arbuthnot had won the title of Best Home Cook.The tweet said: And here she is, our winner of Best Home Cook  Congratulations Suzie!

The Belfast Agreement itself allows for people living in Northern Ireland to identy as British, Irish, or both. This Government#s clear preference is for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. We have always made clear that, in accordance with the  Agreement, it is for the people of Northern Ireland to decide and we will always back their democratic wishes.It remains the Secretary of State#s view that a majority of the people of Northern Ireland continue to support Northern Ireland#s place in the United Kingdom and that this is unlikely to change for at least the foreseeable future. The circumstances set out in the Belfast Agreement that require the Secretary of State to hold a referendum on Irish unication are therefore not satisfied.The Irish government response failed to commit to the creation of a forum, and offered no further criteria for a border poll. The letter states: The Taoiseach has stated that the Government will continue to listen to and engage with the views of everyone on this island, both on rights issues and on the constitutional future that they wish to see for NI - whether nationalist, unionist or neither. These are extremely important issues which naturally require very careful and serious consideration and the Government will continue to engage and reflect on them.The motion, proposed by Stormont Communities minister and former councillor Deirdre Hargey, states: This city has an ever-growing population of young people who will ultimately have to live with the long term consequences of this British Government#s damaging policy of attempting to drag citizens out of the European Union against the wishes of the majority of citizens in Belfast who voted to remain.There is no Brexit that is a good Brexit for the citizens of Belfast or where in Ireland. This council must, therefore, investigate alternative solutions to Brexit that seek to protect its citizens from the damaging effects which Brexit will ultimately bring. In seeking alternative solutions to protect Belfast citizens, a referendum on Irish Unity, as enshrined within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, must be legitimately considered. This is a solution that would protect our citizens from Brexit and is supported by categorical statements from the European Council where, in the event of Irish Unity, the citizens in the north would be ed back into the European Union.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNorthern IrelandPoll shows no evidence to back calls for border vote: AikenUlster Unionist leader Steve Aiken has said a major study showing less than a third of people here support a united Ireland shows there is no evidence to back calls for an imminent border poll.CommentOpinionMarisa McGlinchey:Dissident republicans see the PSNI as upholding the British presence in IrelandThe declining number of Catholic police officers in the PSNI has led to a recent recruitment drive by the organisation in a bid to encourage new recruits, particularly from a Catholic background. ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadColeraine gives Harry Gregg a send-off fit for the hero he was Devastated dad of Co Antrim crash victim pays tribute to his #best friend in the world#Best Home Cook producers apologise for tricolour emoji in tweet announcing winnerQuinn attacks probe uncovers cash laundering money trail Requirements for vote on Irish unity have not been satisfied, Belfast City Council told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thirty years ago it was the Irish.“If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat.” vw,vw,px, px\"A Ryanair plane A spokeswoman for the Muslim Council of Britain said: “Michael O’Leary should be under no illusion: his comments are racist and discriminatory.“He openly advocates discrimination against ‘males of a Muslim persuasion’, which presumably is not based on specic intelligence but solely whether someone ‘looks or acts like a Muslim’.“This is the very definition of Islamophobia.”The spokeswoman said Muslims already face challenges in airline travel and added: “It is a shame that such racism is being expressed so openly, and that the CEO of a large airline would so want to discriminate against his customers so brazenly.”Hate-crime monitoring group Tell Mama said the comments could come back to bite Mr O’Leary’s business, likening them to jewellery firm boss Gerald Ratner’s disastrous remark in  when he called one of his own products “total crap” and was later axed after profits tumbled.In a statement posted on Twitter the group said: “Besides being discriminatory and basing judgements on the ‘looks’ of people, which is abhorrent, O’Leary clearly does not know about the history of terrorism, where people have used others to bypass this blunt and isive technique.“This could be a Gerald Ratner moment for O’Leary, where his flippant statements come back to seriously affect his business.”Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said Mr O’Leary was “encouraging racism”.“If he can tell me what colour Muslims are then I’d be very happy to learn from him – you can’t judge a book by its cover,” he told the Times.He added: “In Germany this week a white person killed eight people.“Should we profile white people to seethey’re being fascists “He’s being very blinkered and is actually encouraging racism.”Mr O’Leary’s remarks came the day after a white female Muslim convert admitted plotting a suicide bomb attack on St Paul’s Cathedral in London.Safiyya Amira Shaikh, , was born Michelle Ramsden but converted to Islam in  and is believed to have become radicalised in  after following extremists online.The airline chief is no stranger to controversial remarks, particularly his comments on environmentalists and travel agents, using the phrase “shoot them” in reference to both.He has also famously proposed coin-operated toilets on flights and dressed up as the pope to launch Ryanair’s new route from Dublin to Rome.PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadBoy detained following -hour domestic incident in Co DonegalRyanair boss Michael O’Leary slammed for ‘abhorrent’ remarks on MuslimsMcDonald says IRA #does not exist# after Garda chief backs view army council still runs Sinn Fein Gerry Adams key player in negotiations for Irish government, Sinn Fein members are toldShots fired at patrol car in Co Donegal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The children and young people have explored what it feels like to grow up in Derry City and Strabane, talking about things like places to play, meeting friends, being healthy and feeling safe.The information collected during the discovery phase will be used to shape the two-three year action plan to make the vision of a Child Friendly Community a reality.Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, attended the event and thanked the young people in attendance for their useful and honest contribution.“Child Friendly Communities aim to create cities and communities where all children have a meaningful say in and truly benefit from the local decisions, services and spaces that shape their lives,” she explained.“With expert training and guidance from Unicef UK, the partnership sees politicians, staff and volunteers turning to children’s rights – as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child – to guide decisions that affect children and young people.“Ongoing work has been taking place at a local level and a range of youth and adult stakeholders have already been involved in remote consultation.”Concluding, the Mayor said:“This event allowed children and young people to have an input into the decisions that affect them – from major policies, to decisions around the care they receive.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Harry Gregg, a legend of the game, passed away this week aged . Gregg’s funeral took place in St Patricks Parish Church on Friday, followed by interment in Coleraine Cemetery. Books of condolences have been opened in both the National Stadium at Windsor Park and at Coleraine Town Hall.Gregg was capped  times for Northern Ireland between  and  but is most well-remembered across the world for his time at Manchester United. His career on Manchester was marred by one of the greatest tragedies of world football, the Munich air disaster. On  February , British European Airways Flight  crashed on its third attempt to take off from Munich-Riem Airport, West Germany,  people died that day, many of them Manchester United players. It has been well recorded, the bravery and actions of Gregg on the site of the crash, having survived, he ed to save a -month old baby, her badly injured pregnant mother and dragged Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet from the wreckage by their waistbands.Tony O’Doherty, Derry City Director and former Northern Ireland footballer, got to know Gregg during summers in Coleraine as a boy. “Harry would have been there, training in the Showgrounds with Victor Hunter and Ian McFaul. Its quite amazing when you think of it, I never realised as a boy but it was three international goalkeepers.”Tony remembers a humility about Gregg that could sometimes be sharp. “Harry was the most down to earth person you ever met in your le, but be prepared because he would know you five minutes and he would very quickly tell you what he thought of you,” he laughed. googletag.cmd.push PlauditsThe plaudits and title of hero never sat well with Gregg who remarked in his autobiography, “Munich has cast a shadow over my le which I found dficult to dispel.” Tony said it seemed that Harry distanced himself from Munich, “Certainly in my company and from people closer to him say, he never talked about it.”Gregg was a teacher in those times, not to outfield players like Tony but to the international goalkeepers around him. “Certainly as a young player he would have watched me and chatted to me but any tips would have been for goalkeepers,” he said. “He must have known something about the goalkeeping arts, to become an international. You knew he was something special. When I was growing up in the game we used to say, I’m sure they still do now, that goalkeepers were ‘mad’ in the nicest sense of the word.” googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Harry Gregg made his name with Manchester United, Northern Ireland and as a hero of the Munich Air Disaster. That huge personality and ‘something special’ was deployed on the pitch and was part of Gregg’s game. O’Doherty says, “That larger than le character was how he kept out goals as well, people talk about commanding your penalty area, Harry certainly did, make no mistake.”Tony struck a relationship with Harry in that time and regularly bumped into Gregg. “My last memory of him was  or  years ago, during Victor Hunter’s testimonial and I actually played in it believe it or not, along with Teddy Sheringham,” he recalled. “I went to go off at half time. Teddy told me, ‘you’re not going off, you’re my legs!’Just as I pulled up to get to that game, Harry pulled in beside me and I had a chat with him.” “He wasn’t just larger than le outside the game he was larger than on the pitch.” Harry Gregg played  times for United, and as it has been remarked in the last few mournful days, his strength of will and character was epitomised in a - win over Sheffield Wednesday, just  days after the Munich tragedy.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose.

before.Some of the artefacts included medieval pottery, animal bones, bronze pins, an Early Christian cross slab and a bronze section of a medieval cross with settings for precious stones.Wooden barrel staves were found at the bottom of one pit and Mr Sloan at the lecture will reveal how they have been dated.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey encouraged all those interested to attend the free event.He said: ldquoThe archaeological excavation revealed some very exciting and unusual objects and shows how important this site was in the medieval period.The attendance at the

Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar community facility unused over power supply issue  ","story":"A COMMUNITY centre in Ballykinlar is lying unused because it has no electricity supply, it emerged this week.Newry, Mourne and Down councillors heard on Monday night that the long awaited Ballykinlar Community Centre has yet to be occupied even though it has been ready since Christmas.The issue is that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run facility.The centre, a prefabricated building formerly used by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service in Downpatrick, was moved to the former Kindle Primary School School site in Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the centre but I canrsquot give them a date when it is opening.Mr Addis said he had to lobby to get the council to allow the contractorrsquos generator to be used to power the councilrsquos sustainable Christmas tree for a few days and he is angry that this was not continued beyond that.ldquoThis is not acceptable and needs to be sorted out, said Mr Addis. ldquoIrsquom calling on the council, NIE and the MoD to address the power supply on as soon as possible.Last night the Ministry of Defence indicated that it had been working with NIE Networks and ldquoawaited confirmation of the proposed works.A spokesman said: ldquoWe continue to work with Northern Ireland Electricity Networks on the installation of a power supply for the community centre.ldquoThe MOD has a long relationship with the

Down Cathedral on Sunday afternoon, the Right Rev David McClay said Jesus Christ died on the cross for everyone and that the Church had a responsibility to teach the world of God.ldquoWe are charged to take His message out into the world, to our towns, villages, townlands and beyond, he said. ldquoWe have a responsibility to teach Godrsquos word to those who are not here today.The service was attended by clergy and lay readers from throughout the Down and Dromore diocese.Also in attendance were clergy from other denominations, including Fr John Murray, Downpatrick parish priest, and Canon Sean Rogan, a former parish priest in the town.Also present were the Rev Dr Heather Morris, a former president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, and Abbot Mark-Ephraim and Fr Eric from the Benedictine Holy Cross Abbey in Rostrevor.Among the dignitaries were the Lord Lieutenant for Co Down, Mr David Lindsay,Baroness Margaret Ritchie, Strangford MP Jim Shannon, MLAs Colin McGrath and Michelle McIlveen, Newry, Mourne and Down Council vice-chairman Terry Andrews and local councillors Dermot Curran, Cadogan Enright and Oonagh Hanlon.Welcoming everyone to the service, the Dean of

ceremonially striking his pastoral staff on the west door of the cathedral to gain admittance.The mandate of the Archbishop of Armagh for the enthronement was read by the Rev Simon Doogan, Diocesan Registrar.In a challenging address, Bishop McClay said ldquoone size no longer fitted all and that the Church needed to reach out.ldquoOur society today has so many people with no meaningful

Just  people posted comments in relation to the graffiti incident.Police suspect that the graffiti incidents took place late last Friday evening or in the early hours of Saturday and are keen for anyone who can help with their investigations to come forward.Both incidents have sparked a sharp rebuke from South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Willie Clarke.Mr McGrath said there was no place for what he described as ldquohateful graffiti in society, lsquolet alone a gable wall overlooking a graveyardrsquo.He remarked: ldquoThis is an act of vandalism and is completely unacceptable. I utterly condemn those behind this. They should be ashamed of their actions.Mr McGrath added: ldquoThose responsible do not represent the people of South Down and these actions will not be tolerated.Cllr Clarke said many people have been left ldquodisgusted at the incident.He said no one in Newcastle will condone what happened and that it was ldquoparticularly disturbing that graffiti was painted on a gable wall of a pensionerrsquos home next to a graveyard.Cllr Clarke said graveyards are sacrosanct, places where people go to pay their respects to loved ones. He said visitors attended the graves of loved ones should not have to look at graffiti.He declared: ldquoI believe that both graffiti incidents are linked and would appeal to anyone who has any information to come forward to assist police with their enquiries.ldquoI have spoken to the owner of the house at the Downs Road and she is understandably annoyed at what happened. I suspect those who responsible forthe graffiti incidents were either high or alcohol or drugs or a combination of both.ldquoNo one wants to see anything like this in Newcastle or indeed any other town or village across the district.

With representatives from Tels Fitness, Murlough AC, Crossgar Harriers and Down Triathlon Club and some solo runners joining our own crowd, there was a jolly band of nearly  runners hitting the streets.Storm Dennis was a bit of a concern, but having consulted the weather charts it was decided to proceed with caution. In actual fact, although there was a taxing head wind at some points, it was dry until after all ed, so Denis was not able to put off these hardcore folk.They soon warmed up with hot drinks and snacks and the general feeling was that it was a good job, well done. All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event. And so it came to pass that after completing  laps and . miles that the winner was Peter Cromie, following Eoinrsquos retirement at the end of lap . What a battle this proved.In the absence of any results it is not possible to comment further on how any locals fared, but hopefully Irsquoll have more information next week.Jimmyrsquos If you havenrsquot yet signed up to Jimmyrsquos ,  then you should put it on your to do list asap as it is only four weeks until race day.Entries online at https:athleticsni.org Fixtures Jimmys-Ten- or email info@eastdownac for further information.

Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out. They have been behind us the entire way.Shane believes that he and Connor, whorsquos originally from South Devon, were meant for each other.ldquoFor me, it was definitely love at first sight. Once we got together, we became inseparable, said Shane, whorsquos a support worker for Autism Initiatives in Newcastle.ldquoI just loved Connorrsquos personality and how caring he was as a person and how he would do anything for anyone. Of course, hersquos also beautul.For Connor, who works in a Newcastle cafeacute, said he was drawn to Shanersquos ldquoopen, honest face and knew right away he was ldquoa good guy.When the two young men decided to commit to one another, they initially believed that it would be a civil partnership ceremony.Same-sex marriage was only made legal in Northern Ireland mdash in line with the rest of the UK mdash on January  as it was voted in by MPs in the House of Commons last autumn. Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple. Itrsquos a really big thing and part of Northern Irelandrsquos history so we feel privileged to be a part of it.The couple intend to make Co Down their home in the future and see themselves as parents.Shane said: ldquoWe would love to have children, whether thatrsquos by using a surrogate or by adopting, but itrsquos definitely one of the big things in our future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Storm.jpg","title":"Storm sewage deluge  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Ballynahinch have appealed for an end to what they have described as a ldquoflooding nightmare at the busy Lisburn Street junction with Main Street in the town.Persistent heavy rain swept in by Storm Dennis last Saturday left the busy Ballynahinch junction under water with traders forced to take precautions to protect their property.Storm water and raw sewage flow into a combined drain which struggles to cope when there is heavy rain, with speculation locally that a section of underground piping is blocked.Matt Comiskey, of Jordyrsquos Bar, said sewage was evident during last Saturdayrsquos deluge and revealed that while the issue has been raised with NI Water on a number of occasions, no affirmative action has been taken.He has been informed that work to address the issue will result in a section of Lisburn Street having to be dug up. He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

We have strong economic, social, cultural and political arguments which we should never shy away from highlighting.I disagree with Christopher’s assertion that we are on a “slow march towards a united Ireland”.Such thinking is not borne out by the evidence. Even after the turbulence of recent years the most recent opinion poll shows less than % would vote to take Northern Ireland out of the UK.Regardless of their background, people want to see positive unionist leadership which is working towards a better future rather than tacitly accepting the united Ireland is ‘just around the corner’ argument republicans have been putting forward for nearly a century now.Letter to the editorThe New Decade New Approach deal was about acknowledging the erse identities. Making everyone feel at home in Northern Ireland and ensuring we have the best schools, hospitals, welfare system and economic prospects are ways we can give practical demonstration of the benefits of the Union.People in Northern Ireland cannot control the outcome of elections in the Republic of Ireland. We are obviously interested neighbours, but our focus should be here at home.The % election result in Dublin wasn’t an advertisement for a united Ireland.Indeed, it arose because of some signicant problems within the Republic which actually highlight advantages of staying in the UK.As the largest unionist political party there is an obvious responsibility upon the DUP to promote our place in the United Kingdom. Every party wants to attract support from as many voters as possible. However, unionism is not limited to one inidual or party.There is an onus on us all to be salespeople for the Union and to make sure that our actions and words help create the Northern Ireland where people feel at home and at peace within the United Kingdom.Gordon Lyons, DUP MLA, East Antrim"},{"url":null,"title":"criticism sinn fein irish leaders has come far too late ","story":"Woman twice defecated on floor at Larne HarbourSomme mural attacked in East Antrim villageNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionCriticism of Sinn Fein by Irish leaders has come far too lateFianna Fail and Fine Gael’s leaders, Micheal Martin and Leo Varadkar, have both made fierce remarks about IRA influence on Sinn Fein.By The NewsroomSaturday, nd February , : amUpdated Saturday, nd February , : pm\"\"News Letter editorialThe controversy has flared up after Drew Harris, the garda commissioner, said that his force shared the assessment of the PSNI that the Army Council oversees both Sinn Fein and the IRA.You would hardly know, however, that this is the PSNI view. A  paramilitary report used convoluted language to say republicans believed that such influence still existed. The PSNI has said little in the meantime, seeming instead to want to show republicans a friendly face.It is not just the PSNI but legal, security and political figures who appear to be at pains to avoid making judgement. The Independent Reporting Commission is clearly not the body to give us a comprehensive assessment of the IRA and any influence that the terror group has on politics and society here. We need a new organisation for that vital role.While Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar’s remarks are welcome, and while Mr Martin has long been critical of Sinn Fein, it is too late. Dublin put no pressure on republicans in Northern Ireland, despite their intermittently disgraceful conduct after , or their post  veto on devolution until their blackmail got reward in a powerful Irish language commissioner. Ireland rejected any penalty for SF. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

To that end, hearing huge news tonight that the Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament have agreed to our request for an inquiry into diplomatic immunity and extradition. ##mdash Radd SeigerFebruary , Earlier this month, the Foreign Office said they had ldquono plans to launch a public inquiry into the case ndash saying the case had been handled ldquoproperly and lawfully throughout.The teenager was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car driven by Mrs Sacoolas outside a US military base in Northamptonshire on August  last year.Mrs Sacoolas, the -year-old we of an intelligence official based at RAF Croughton, was granted diplomatic immunity after the crash and sparked international controversy after being allowed toto her home country.She was later charged with causing Mr Dunnrsquos death by dangerous driving.Mr Dunnrsquos mother, Charlotte Charles and father, Tim Dunn, said they were told by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab that the Government was ldquoreviewing all our options after Mr Pompeorsquos refusal to extradite Mrs Sacoolas.Speaking about Mr Assangersquos potential extradition to the US, Mr Seiger said: ldquoHarry Dunnrsquos family understand and respect the importance of extradition procedures between nations and the huge public interest that attaches to extradition.ldquoNo one is above the law and no one must be allowed to evade justicethey manage to flee a country, whether diplomat or not.ldquoThat said, in refusing the UKrsquos perfectly lawful request to extradite Anne Sacoolas, and not even following the legal and judicial process the US UK Treaty calls for, the US has launched the single greatest attack on the so called special relationship between the countries in modern memory.Mr Seiger continued: ldquoThe US is not behaving like an ally and has effectively thumbed its nose up at the UK and ignored the clearly laid out provisions in the treaty, effectively tearing it up.ldquoThe principle of reciprocity is at the core of any extradition treaty. Despite its disgraceful refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the US continues to seek the extradition of people in the UK such as Julian Assange.ldquoIn doing so, they are demonstrating an extraordinary amount of hypocrisy and the double standards on display are unprecedented.ldquoThe US needs to be brought firmly back into line on the international stage and be made to understand that they are not going to have their way. vw,vw,px, px\"Julian Assangersquos full extradition hearing is due to begin next week Mr Seigerrsquos comments followed Saturdayrsquos protest in which hundreds of Assangersquos supporters marched through London ahead of next weekrsquos full extradition hearing.Calling for the Government to block the extradition request, Mr Seiger said: ldquoIn accordance with the principle of reciprocity which the US is failing to abide by, on behalf of Harry Dunnrsquos family and the millions of concerned citizens in the UK, I now demand that the UK authorities block any further extraditions to the US, including the one of Julian Assange, until such time as Anne Sacoolas is extradited and back on UK soil facing the justice system here.ldquoDominic Raab told us when we met with him on January  that lsquowe are reviewing all our optionsrsquo following the refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas.ldquoI now call him to exercise that option of refusing to extradite Julian Assange and others to the USA.ldquoIt is high time that the UK Government comes out and shows us what they are made ofthey are to instil any confidence that they really do have our backs, Harryrsquos family having been so badly let down following his death last August..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Block Julian Assange extradition, Harry Dunn us family urges Government article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
