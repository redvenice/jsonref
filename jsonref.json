He grew up in Leipzig and spent his childhood under communism, then his teens, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, under capitalism he was fascinated to see familiar streetscapes colonised by advertising hoardings. His career has reflected that dichotomy. He has worked as a commercial photographer to fund an enduring fascination with the post-Soviet atmospheres of the east. When fellow art students relocated to London or Berlin after graduating, he settled in Moscow and began making photographs of the city’s interiors, taking his Hasselblad camera into waiting rooms and tiled hotel lobbies and curious bars, alive to juxtaposition and surreal comedy.This picture was taken in the meadows on the banks of the River Moscow, on the fringe of the 850th anniversary park. The contrast in scale and tone between the picnicking mother and her toddler and the vast, foreboding architecture of the electricity pylons is typical of Herfort’s work. He is drawn to scenes in which people innocently inhabit places slightly beyond their understanding, as if they have been dropped there from a different time and place altogether.There is something about what he calls the “chaos and the lightness and good-naturedness of ordinary Russians” that he tries to frame in different ways. The contrasts between the pictures he takes are as important as the contrasts within them. “I was always interested in shooting single photographs,” he says, “which show worlds and stories in one image.” He finds the classical reportage style, where you photograph 30 images of a story in series, too repetitive. “I think you can skip the before, after and in between. This is for me photography, the art of using just one frame.”Russian Fairytales by Frank Herfort will be published by Kerber Verlag (£36) later this spring"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ffec578c740986a6d583761f38fa8eec0248249/426_363_2554_1532/master/2554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b868946188722671737dac32b5392e35","title":"us libraries say lgbtq children books most calls for bans last year alex gino george","story":"Annual list of the most challenged books includes Alex Gino’s George, about a transgender girl, and John Oliver’s picture book about a gay rabbit, A Day in the Life of Marlon BundoThe American Library Association’s annual list of the most challenged books in public, school and academic libraries was topped by Alex Gino’s George, which has made the top 10 every year since it was published in 2015. Objections to the book, about a child who “knows she’s not a boy”, cited sexual references and conflict with “traditional family structure”, with some saying schools and libraries should not “put books in a child’s hand that require discussion”.Other books that drew protests included the picture book And Tango Makes Three, about two male penguins adopting an egg to create a family in a zoo, and Last Week Tonight host John Oliver’s parody picture book A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, which some concerned readers felt was “designed to pollute the morals of its readers”. Written by Last Week Tonight writer Jill Twiss and “dedicated to every bunny who has ever felt different, the bestseller about a gay rabbit was released just before Marlon Bundo’s A Day in the Life of the Vice President, a children’s book about Mike Pence’s own rabbit by his daughter Charlotte. Pence is opposed to same sex marriage, and Oliver told his viewers: “Selling more books than Pence will probably really piss him off.”Susan Kuklin’s Beyond Magenta, in which teenagers talk about being transgender, was criticised by challengers for “its effect on any young people who would read it”, while Daniel Haack’s Prince \u0026amp Knight, a picture book that ends with the title characters getting married, was described by those attempting to ban it as “a deliberate attempt to indoctrinate young children”. Only two titles in the top 10 had no LGBTQ content: Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, for its profanity and “vulgarity and sexual overtones”, said the ALA, and the Harry Potter series. JK Rowling’s books were criticised for “containing actual curses and spells”, and for including characters that use “nefarious means” to attain goals.In a joint statement, more than 40 free-speech groups including the National Coalition Against Censorship, Planned Parenthood and GLAAD condemned the growing pressure on libraries and schools to remove LGBTQ children’s books.“When LGBTQ stories are silenced in this way, LGBTQ youth and children from LGBTQ families get the message that their own stories – their very lives – do not have value, that they are shameful,” their statement read. “However, reading stories that acknowledge their experiences, in which they can recognise themselves and their families, reinforces their sense of self-worth and helps them overcome the experience of and feelings associated with social marginalisation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/010ee661e7492c2eef19886e8b8d80aa5acf8a40/0_163_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e1098349cb5dffb4ee34843e618eb88","title":"supermarket staff workers tell us coronavirus affected your work","story":"Are you under extra pressure?

This money could be used to establish a European recovery fund. But where will the money come from?I propose that the European Union should raise the money needed for the fund by selling “perpetual bonds”, on which the principal does not have to be repaid (although they can be repurchased or redeemed at the issuer’s discretion). Authorising this issue should be the first priority for the European council summit on 23 April.It would, of course, be unprecedented for the EU to issue perpetual bonds, especially in such a large amount. But other governments have relied on perpetual bonds in the past. The best-known example is Britain, which used consolidated bonds (Consols) to finance the Napoleonic wars and war bonds to finance the first world war. These bond issues were traded in London until 2015, when both were redeemed. In the 1870s, the US Congress authorised the treasury to issue Consols to consolidate already existing bonds, and they were issued in subsequent years.The EU is facing a once-in-a-lifetime war against a virus that is threatening not only people’s lives, but also the very survival of the union. If member states start protecting their national borders against even their fellow EU members, this would destroy the principle of solidarity on which the union is built.Instead, Europe needs to resort to extraordinary measures to deal with an extraordinary situation that is hitting all of the EU’s members. This can be done without fear of setting a precedent that could justify issuing common EU debt once normalcy has been restored. Issuing bonds that carried the full faith and credit of the EU would provide a political endorsement of what the European Central Bank has already done: removed practically all the restrictions on its bond purchasing programme.Perpetual bonds have three additional advantages that make them appropriate for these circumstances.For starters, because perpetual bonds never have to be repaid, they would impose a surprisingly light fiscal burden on the EU, despite the considerable financial firepower they would mobilise. The EU, moreover, would not have to refinance them when they came due, make amortisation payments, or even set aside money (for example, in a sinking fund) for their eventual repayment.The second advantage is more technical but almost as important. The market may not be able to absorb a €1tn issue all at once. By issuing a perpetual bond, the EU could raise this amount in instalments, without creating a new bond each time.The third advantage is that an EU-issued perpetual bond would be a very attractive asset for the ECB’s bond-purchase programmes. Since the maturity of a perpetual bond is always the same, the ECB would not be required to rebalance its portfolio.The EU does not need to create any new mechanism or structure to issue the bonds, because the EU has issued bonds in the past. The proceeds should be used for investments and grants related to fighting the pandemic. The European commission would disperse the funds either directly or through the member states and other institutions (such as municipal governments) that are directly involved in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.The disruption caused by the pandemic should be temporary, but only if Europe’s leaders take the extraordinary measures needed to avoid long-term damage to the EU. That is why the EU recovery fund is so desperately needed. Financing it with perpetual bonds is the easiest, fastest, and least costly way to establish it.• George Soros is the founder and chair of the Open Society Foundations, and is also the author, most recently, of In Defense of Open Society (Public Affairs, 2019)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18568767a9d851e27529b27cfcdf7faa6b1ce42/0_187_5230_3139/master/5230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16154e172dc8c5144527863f6857b1e5","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of dinner","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘dinner’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘dinner’.Share your photos of what dinner means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 22 April at 10am.

And fathers can also play a unique role. “From some of the studies we’ve done, we know that the children of fathers who are more engaged – and usually that’s in a playful way – tend to do better in terms of their behaviour and development,” he says.“Rough and tumble play and other types of physical play can be great fun and can help children learn lots of different skills, such as physical coordination and self-control,” he adds. “Dads can also get involved in a wide variety of play activities, including fun games and singing songs with younger children.”He says parents should not worry about the kind of play – “children will learn and enjoy different things from different kinds of play, and taking the time to play with your children, getting stuck in, is the most important thing”.Watch what your child is doing and try to follow their lead, doing what interests them. He says this responsive parenting is key to supporting young children’s learning and social and emotional development. “Slow down and let the child complete the task themselves, however long it takes, because that is how they learn.”“Research looking at the effect of parents being playful is still underway, so it’s difficult to answer the question about benefits of playful parenting from the science at the moment, but we do know that children being able to play freely is associated with better health outcomes and potentially lower stress,” he says.“The most important thing for young children in times of stress is receiving predictable care and love from parents or carers they trust, but time to play is going to help.” So does he get to play with bricks and plastic square heads all day? “No, it’s a great job title, but I knew it wasn’t going to involve – as some media headlines suggested – teaching posh students to play Lego.”Instead, Ramchandani, a practising child psychiatrist and former professor of child and adolescent mental health at Imperial College London, has been tasked with leading Cambridge’s research into the role of play in child development.He warns that formalised education appears to be creeping down the age range, and he is not convinced that didactic learning environments for young children offer long-term benefits. “I don’t think there’s any evidence it does anybody any great good. I think we ought to be stopping and potentially reversing it.”Opportunities for unstructured play in the early years are really important and expecting young children to sit and learn in structured environments for long periods does not fit with their developmental needs, he adds. “I haven’t yet seen any evidence that kids in systems that formalise education later do any worse. So I lean towards thinking we should formalise education a little later.”Ramchandani, 51, the son of a hairdresser and an accountant, was born in Maidstone, Kent. He went to state schools there and in Bristol, where his family moved, before studying medicine at Southampton University.After graduating he spent 10 years in the NHS and training as a child psychiatrist – he decided to focus on children after noticing that the roots of many adults’ mental health problems often started in childhood.He is critical of the UK’s education structure, and in particular the focus on formal learning. “I struggle with the way learning is set up in this country, in terms of the age at which we expect children to settle down and sit in class. Children at quite young ages are now being set ‘learning goals’. In my work as a child psychiatrist, I saw lots of boys, in particular, who get referred at six or seven because they’re not able to sit still in class and attend to the lesson.”While some will have severe neuro-developmental disorders, “there are a lot of others who end up in difficulty because they are just not quite ready for sitting still like that.” They get unfairly labelled as “difficult” or “not fitting in”, he says.Play, he says, is a child’s way of exploring the world, learning about consequences, how things fit together and how relationships work. “We’re trying to understand where play may work – because it’s not that if we just leave children to free play, they’re going to learn better. There’s no evidence for that.”The question he wants to answer is this: “Where would play-based learning be best for aspects of children’s learning and education, and where would another approach be better?”The lack of funding in state schools compared with the “amazing” resources of many independent schools concerns him. “The fact that most children don’t get those opportunities just seems to me to be tragic. I’m not doing down the state system – I’m very grateful for my state-school education, which provided me with tons of opportunities. But you see the difference in resourcing and opportunities. It’s just staggering to me that this is an acceptable ‘given’ of society.”Inequality of opportunity from the start is the worst thing about the system, he says. “I wonder what a visitor from another planet would make of it: that we’re prepared to allocate children to massively different resourced education systems, just on the accident of their family’s wealth. It’s staggering. It’s ridiculous. It narrows opportunity for everybody – and it means we’re not making the most of the talents of the widest range of people, which is crazy.”He would like state school funding increased to provide more teachers per pupil, and more joined-up government thinking about the opportunities for children, particularly in their first few years.“There isn’t any kind of coherent story about what landscape we want to create for our children. “We’re not looking out for them. We’re not thinking about them. And we really should be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c80883bdbe3e3a30a2bbc3f5bba26ace40e38b2/0_142_2069_1241/master/2069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e7549a92514d76e730844bad384c31","title":"new big 5 wildlife photography project in pictures","story":"An international initiative aims to do away with the old big five of wildlife – based on the toughest animals to shoot and kill – and create a new selection based on photography, not hunting.

In March, it was announced that fashion weeks in London, Paris and Milan would be cancelled or postponed. The industry also put a halt to key events like the New York politan Museum’s Met Gala, the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards, and the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers.London fashion week is now set to merge womenswear and menswear, following a recent trend for mixed shows from heavy-hitting brands including Burberry, Gucci and Jacquemus.Currently halted in its tracks, the fashion industry has been forced into a period of reflection with questions being raised about consumption and the number of shows held each season.Last week, designer Marc Jacobs argued that it was only necessary to have two shows a year. “The amount of stuff we make and the quantity we make and the amount of time it’s shown – it’s just so excessive,” he told the Vogue Global Conversations webinar.“We’ve done everything to such excess that there is no consumer for all of it, and everyone is exhausted by it. It’s all become a chore.”Despite Russia’s fashion week and Shanghai fashion week taking place entirely online, the question of whether digital shows could work as well as physical ones is still being debated. When Giorgio Armani showed his latest collection to an empty room at the coronavirus-hit Milan fashion week in February, critics called it “eerie”.London-based designer Feng Chen Wang told the : “We can use digital to add new layers, but we still need the physical interaction to understand form, technique and fabric.“I can see digital working for order-taking when a retailer already knows the brand, understands its values and is confident in placing an order remotely.

Here are 10 of the best.Food52 calls Barbara Kafka’s creamy lemon pasta “the most luxurious-feeling dinner you can conjure from near-thin air”. Combine the zest of two lemons with 230ml double cream (the key!), and salt and pepper to taste, and bring to the boil over a medium heat.

They were fifth in the table but with genuine title pretentions, holding as they did between two and four games in hand on those above them, and had won six of their past eight matches.Newcastle’s previous seven games had featured 30 goals at an average of 4.3 each and the ’s chief football writer, David Lacey, in his report on their relatively dreary 1-1 draw at Chelsea two days earlier, had concluded that “if Newcastle’s defence repeats its sluggish performance West Ham should net a shoal of goals”. It was quite the prediction: at Upton Park, in a state of complete, injury-enforced disarray, they conceded eight.The match is most commonly remembered for Alvin Martin’s hat-trick, the first of his career and the first scored in the league against three different goalkeepers, and for the exuberant attacking of a West Ham team that would eventually miss out on the title by four points (and a bit of goal difference). “It was,” Robert Armstrong wrote in the , “an extraordinary performance even by the high standards of skill, pace and finishing power the Hammers set themselves.” But as that hat-trick statistic suggests, it was a night of wild misfortune for the visitors. As the Hammers’ Newcastle-born assistant manager Mick McGiven put it after the match: “United should forget all about the result – I can hardly remember a team having so much bad luck in one game.”Jeff Clarke, an ever-present all season at the heart of defence, was out with a knee injury Glenn Roeder, who had recently recovered from food poisoning, scored an own goal and conceded a penalty Chris Hedworth, a 21-year-old academy graduate whose five previous first-team appearances had come at centre-half or right-back, was crowbarred into midfield John Anderson started in defence but because of a strained achilles and with the team’s one permitted substitution used up ended hobbling uselessly on the right wing, unable to do such basic activities as running and kicking.In goal, at least at the start, was Martin Thomas, who had suffered a shoulder injury in training in early March and missed seven games before coming back and promptly injuring the shoulder again. Gary Kelly, his back-up, had only just had his plaster removed following a knee operation and Kelly’s replacement, David McKellar, who arrived on loan from Hibernian having not played a first-team game for nine months, had picked up hip and groin injuries in that draw at Chelsea, forcing Thomas to prematurely return. “Really there was no way I should have been playing but it was a case of having to because Dave found that the hip injury he had picked up at Chelsea had spread to his groin,” Thomas said. “He could hardly walk.”Thomas’s fragile fitness lasted all of two minutes, when he “landed awkwardly and tore all the muscles in my shoulder”. Two minutes later Hedworth fouled Neil Orr, Alan Devonshire floated a free-kick into the area and Martin volleyed in. In the 11th minute Ray Stewart’s long-range drive went through Thomas’s hands, then a similar if more central effort from Orr did likewise. Roeder’s backheeled own goal made if 4-0 at the interval, which was when Thomas gave up.Peter Beardsley, who would occasionally play in goal during training sessions, volunteered to replace him but the manager, Willie McFaul, refused to allow it. “I was not prepared to throw in the towel,” he said. “I wanted him to stay where he was because there was always a chance that he could have pulled a goal back for us.” Hedworth was chosen instead. “I haven’t played in goal since I was a schoolboy, but I had injured my knee early in the game and I felt I had no alternative to give it a go,” he said.Ten minutes later he fractured a collarbone in a collision with Tony Cottee he persevered for a while, but after Martin headed in a 64th-minute corner he also gave up. He moved to left midfield, forming with Anderson the game’s all-time least mobile pair of wingers. “It took guts to do what he did,” said McFaul. “How he carried on does not bear thinking about.” (Three weeks later, and without making another appearance, Hedworth was released on a free transfer.)Ironically it was only after Beardsley finally went in goal that Newcastle pulled a goal back, through Billy Whitehurst. It took until the 81st minute for West Ham to score their sixth, but the seventh came within two minutes and then the referee, Bob Hamer, spotted a handball from Roeder a few seconds after the restart. Stewart was the team’s official penalty taker, but Martin insisted he get a chance to complete his hat-trick.The match ended with West Ham’s fans serenading Beardsley with chants of “England’s No 1”, while Newcastle’s own supporters refused to let the scoreline deter them from celebrating an impressively gutsy if wildly unfortunate display. “All the lads had a go and in the circumstances I just wished we had kept it to five,” concluded McFaul.For one visiting player the discomfort did not end with the final whistle: England were due to play Scotland at Wembley two days later, and Beardsley had arranged to stay with a friend in London in case Bobby Robson decided to call on him. With hindsight, however, he would probably have asked someone other than Alvin Martin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f7aa28a7dad217bfed85c47d9107a525bb3fac8/0_204_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a86ee13e9ef54490d32834ad8f8c893e","title":"barcelona to sell camp nou naming rights and give proceeds to charity","story":"Barcelona’s stadium will have a formal name for the first time in its 63-year existence after the club announced plans to sell next season’s rights and hand the proceeds to charitable activities and the fight against coronavirus.The Camp Nou, which means the new ground, became the de facto name of Barça’s stadium after it was inaugurated in 1957, later rubber-stamped in a members’ referendum. Now it will get a surname as the club seek a sponsor for 2020-21 – a first step towards the sale of the naming rights as construction begins on a new 105,000-capacity stadium which they hope to have completed on the same site within four years. The current Camp Nou is Europe’s largest football stadium.Barcelona announced that they would cede the title rights to the club’s charitable foundation, which would manage the process. They hope to find a sponsor in the coming weeks and plan for part of the monies raised to go towards charities involved in the investigation of Covid-19. Other charities, chosen by the sponsor and the foundation, would also benefit. The deal will last for a year, after which the search for a permanent title holder would continue. Barcelona’s stadium has never had a title, still less a commercial one.This move is reminiscent of Barca’s decision to name Unicef as their first ever shirt sponsor in 2006. Rather than being paid, the club contributed €1.6m a year to carry Unicef’s name, serving as a soft launch for commercial sponsors thereafter, beginning with the Qatar foundation and then Qatar Airways.Barcelona said that the plan fits their claim to be “more than a club” and that they hope to be able to “create a wave of hope for millions of people around the world who are suffering due to this pandemic”. A statement described this as a “global crisis without precedents” during which Barcelona have to “assume responsibility”.“We are very happy to be able to drive forward this initiative that offers something as emblematic as the name of our stadium so that institutions, organisations, businesses may associate themselves with it and as such contribute to the fight against Covid-19 given that their investment will be used to finance research projects on the illness and projects that are working to eradicate to lessen its effects,” the statement said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e354ed1d1cf032ff0f52de2d7bc52d4cb3d7794f/2_155_1243_746/master/1243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2925c333c9fca93d7d68f173ef89958","title":"football quiz when blackburn won the premier league 25 years ago","story":"Who lifted the trophy?

Or at least she did, until coronavirus hit and two of her housemates insisted that their respective partners move in for the duration of quarantine.“It’s for our wellbeing, Tracy,” one of her housemates said to her on the day he moved his boyfriend into their home. “It’s a necessity that we’re together.”Tracy’s bedroom is between her partnered housemates’ rooms, meaning that she now hears both couples having sex through the thin walls. If her two remaining housemates hook up downstairs – a strong possibility given the year-long “weird sexual tension” between them – she could be privy to grunts and moans from all angles, none of which will be hers. “It’s honestly hell,” says Tracy, who feels like she was bulldozed into her current situation.She’s one of a group of people in a unique category of quarantine purgatory: singles living with couples. While singles living on their own may experience intense loneliness and couples could find their relationships tested (or strengthened), singles living with couples cop both extremes. For the most part, these singles are excluded from the couple’s plans or find themselves in a third-wheel situation they would never have tolerated pre-quarantine, when they could socialise, date, have casual sex and enjoy myriad activities outside the home.In situations like Tracy’s, where single people feel guilted into letting their housemate’s partners stay, it’s hard to feel anything other than resentment, especially when there’s virtually no escape. The couples in Tracy’s home have colonized the kitchen, living room and garden respectively, leaving Tracy with only her bedroom to retreat to – and their own bedroom antics mean she’s not guaranteed peace and quiet there, either. One of the couples in her house, who starting dating six months ago, are even planning to shoot webcam sex videos (thankfully, in their bedroom).Psychologist Bella DePaulo says that moving partners into sharehouses during the pandemic is entitled couples’ behaviour at its worst. “Couples making decisions will often do whatever serves them best, even if it is a different answer at different times,” she notes. “They can be perfectly nice people who unconsciously believe that when they are dealing with a single person, their wishes and point of view should prevail.”Like Tracy, Shannon, 38, was told that her housemate’s boyfriend, a soldier, had “nowhere else to go” when he moved into her London sharehouse. He came straight from army barracks, where cramped quarters heighten the risk of contracting Covid-19.“So now not only are we in isolation, but we’ve got a fourth person in the house who kind of doesn’t do much and potentially could have coronavirus because he hasn’t been locked down long enough for us to know whether he’s got symptoms or not,” says Shannon. She understands why couples would want to be together, “but it’s come at the expense of a risk to my health that I haven’t really consented to”. Rent is also an issue – neither Tracy nor Shannon’s new “housemates” are paying any.In her one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco, 24-year-old Jade can’t even access her own TV in the living room that her sister and her boyfriend have been occupying, rent-free, for over a year now. Jade’s single status hits harder during lockdown, as the couple watch box sets while she hides away in her bedroom. “I’m so starved for human touch, a hug would go such a long way right now,” she says.“Usually I’m not too focused on being single, but in this situation it feels like there’s a spotlight on that fact because I don’t have any of the other things in my life to focus on.” Jade, a self-described extrovert, feels like she’s “intruding on their world” whenever she tries to chat with the couple. ”Whenever they do talk to me, it feels like a breath of fresh air and I start talking about everything because I’ve had nowhere else to put my thoughts,” she says.Even in situations where singles and couples were cohabiting comfortably previously, lockdown can change household dynamics dramatically, causing even the happily single to long for a relationship. One New York single, Kara, 32, reported her housemates’ excruciating quarantine habit of saying “I miss you” every time one of them left the room, while their cuddling on the couch is even harder to bear. “I miss knowing what it feels like to have someone to do that with,” says Kara, who has been single for two years.In Chicago, Bianca, 29, feels similarly triggered when her brother and his girlfriend are snuggling. Bianca’s dog can’t join her on the other couch because of her brother’s allergies, “so I’m just over there all cold and lonely”, she says. She describes them as “a beautiful couple”, it’s just that their relationship is harder to stomach in isolation. “Before the quarantine I could see friends or go visit my family, I received other forms of love that aren’t necessarily romantic,” she says. “Now, I can’t do that.”Over a month into lockdown, it’s still hard to know when life will return to normal, but the downtime has given these single people a chance to reflect on the sort of connections they want to make going forward. Tracy “cannot wait to get laid!” while Shannon says she’s going to “take dating seriously” after quarantine. At 38, she’s concerned that Covid-19 might further impede her desire to start a family. “Thanks to coronavirus, I’ll make a real effort to find love,” she says.Nadia has had a few realizations in lockdown, namely that she doesn’t want a baby or marriage but also that she has been feeling lonely for a few years now. “I’m growing to accept my needs for a partner, something that I was perceiving as a weakness in the past,” she says. “The experience has taught me that I should let more people into my life.”Meanwhile, Bianca decided in quarantine that she’s not going to bother with people who don’t make her a priority. “I stopped texting people first,” she says. “I stopped watering dead plants, figuratively. The relationships that remain are the ones I will keep when this is all over.”Names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec5934b34ea6987763dc627b989c95bdb6a40189/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d79ba200695f4bf4db9bc108b3708bf5","title":"just not true were too lazy for farm work say frustrated uk applicants","story":"Jobseekers take issue with pay and terms and allege farmers favouring migrant labourBritish applicants for jobs harvesting crops have said farmers have made it virtually impossible for them to secure the work despite a national appeal for a “land army” to save the UK’s fruit and vegetables.Dozens of workers have expressed anger at claims they are too lazy or picky to take the jobs, alleging that farmers are favouring cheap migrant labour.Offers of on-site accommodation in which three or four workers share a caravan were among the most frequent complaints on social media and in emails to the , after reports that thousands of British workers had turned down jobs and Romanians were being flown in to pick salad.Chay Honey, in Bristol, whose work on festivals has disappeared, said the pay and conditions of the farm work were difficult to justify. “I live with my fiance and to live on site would mean I would only have one day a week for friends and family. They also said you can’t use your own vehicle, which makes getting out to the shops difficult. Very quickly the romance of going to work for a farm to help provide food for the nation has become very unattractive,” he said.“It seems it is very much geared up for migrant labour. We are not looking for special treatment, but the whole system needs to have some flexibility and not just have this blanket approach.”Genevieve Black, in south Wales, said she had been unsuccessful in applications for 10 jobs despite being willing to live on site in Kent, Hampshire or Scotland. “The idea that Brits are just too lazy to work on farms is just not true,” she said.She is part of a Facebook group, Jobs for Camper Nomads, which is awash with criticism of the farming industry. One poster suggested that farmers could allow applicants with their own camper vans to live on site. “We are forever being told these are unprecedented times and we are all in it together. UK berry farmers not so much! I am sure with a bit of thought a workable solution can be found.”Alison Harrow, an England Athletics running coach seeking farm work, said she was feeling “really discouraged”. “I’ve applied for 200 jobs and you either get ‘We’ve got enough people now’ or you don’t hear anything back,” she said. “Well, if they have jobs coming up at the end of May or June, why don’t they just allocate those now and just confirm a job?“I get an email from one farm worker recruitment agency saying I have not been shortlisted. How can this be? There seems to be a mismatch between demand for workers and matching workers to farm work.”Nick Marston, the chair of British Summer Fruits, said the business model of fruit farming had been “structured around a non-UK workforce for many years” because UK workers had shunned the work: “Farms are receiving large numbers of applications and I think it would be unfair to say the industry is not accommodating local workforce.”He appealed for patience among the army of would-be-pickers, saying the season had barely started and that there would be surge in job opportunities at the end of May and June.Tom Bradshaw, vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union ,said he could understand why people felt frustrated over the lack of job offers. “In a way, the media publicity has come a bit too soon, because the jobs don’t peak until the end of May and June,” he said.He added that a national website that “would act as a centralised hub for all recruiters” was expected to launch later this week, which would make it easier to match supply to demand.

Most of the tenants who signed the letter have three corporate landlords that are also the freeholders: Simpson House 3, Reverie Estates SR Limited, and Somerford Assets 3. All three companies are majority owned by the billionaire property developer John Christodoulou.While Somerford Assets 3 is the freeholder for some flats at Olympic House on 12 Somerford Grove, the leaseholder for around a dozen of the tenants who signed the letter is Windermere Holdings Overseas SA, incorporated in the British Virgin Island. The owner of this company is not apparent.Christodoulou owns several properties and hotels across the UK and has appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List. There is no suggestion he was personally aware of the tenants’ request when it was initially made, or the agent’s response.While Tower Quay properties refused to negotiate with the tenancy association, the estate agent did respond to inidual requests.One tenant who had lost their job, and wished to remain anonymous, received the same offer after inquiring about a rent reduction. “I don’t know where they think I’m going to find a job in three months. Nobody is hiring. I just can’t believe they’re not willing to budge just an inch to try and help us out.”Kieran Kirkwood, a spokesperson for London Renters Union (LRU), said: “Tower Quay’s suggestion that their tenants could be saving money on lunch and holidays in the midst of a global pandemic beggars belief.

Kirkwood said failure to do so would result in an “unprecedented crisis of poverty, evictions and homelessness”.A Tower Quay spokesperson said tenants were being supported on an inidual level and that it was clear there were residents who could still pay their rent. “It is also not feasible for a single landlord to simply offer all concessions to all tenants whilst there is no support being offered by the government to landlords to assist this.”The spokesperson apologised if tenants thought remarks on money saved on lunches and cancelled holidays were insensitive, but added: “Based on discussions with other tenants we believe, in good faith, that these comments are true.”Tower Quay said each property has separate corporate landlords and none have a landlord who is an inidual.

It is, she says, the only place she can find respite from the strain of navigating lockdown with five children, four of whom were in school or nursery until a month ago, one of whom is trying to work on his GCSEs. “I didn’t set out to home-school my kids,” she says. “I don’t find it comes particularly naturally.”She is much more accustomed to the glitz and chaos of showbusiness. She first spun into the music mainstream in 2000, with a feature spot on the song Groovejet (If This Ain’t Love) by Spiller, which remains a British radio staple, and she had a steady pop career with follow-up singles Murder on the Dancefloor and Music Gets the Best of Me, plus a run of seven albums. In 2013, she dazzled on Strictly Come Dancing, wowing the judges with, among other performances, a memorably bouncy whirl through the charleston. In the end, she lost out in the final to Abbey Clancy.She was born into the world of entertainment: her mother, Janet Ellis, was a presenter on Blue Peter, while her father is the film producer Robin Bextor. She recalls a cosmopolitan childhood, filled with brunches and celebrity parties. “It definitely shaped me,” she says. She began performing in childhood, later moving into modelling. Before her chart success, she developed a cult following in the late 90s as the sultry singer of indie rock group Theaudience.With her summer touring schedule wiped out due to lockdown, she is finding it hard adjusting to not performing. “I miss it terribly,” she says. “I miss performing, I miss all the plans I had ... but so does everybody.”Growing up in the world of celebrity taught her early on that she would have to work at keeping her private life private. Before lockdown, the idea of letting a camera into her home, and filming her children, would have been inconceivable – but life has changed irrevocably. “I suppose, over the years, I’ve always been quite a private person,” she says. “I don’t normally show the inside of my house. I definitely never show my kids anywhere. But suddenly, I think with everything we’ve all been going through collectively, it just felt like that was totally irrelevant. Like, who cares? No one’s interested in prying we just want to feel a connection. We just want something silly.”The height of her fame came during a frenzied period for the tabloids, which were splashed with women of a similar age – such as Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears – being pilloried for their lives seemingly careering out of control. She, too, was briefly tabloid fodder, when Groovejet went up against Victoria Beckham’s debut solo single, Out of Your Mind, for the No 1 chart slot. The perceived “battle” spawned sniping from both parties, most notably when Ellis-Bextor wore a T-shirt emblazoned “Peckham”, a tongue-in-cheek reference to her competitor’s name. In the end, Ellis-Bextor and Spiller won out.“Some of it was probably just quite good fun,” laughs Ellis-Bextor. “Quite cartoony, wasn’t it? Victoria Beckham from the Spice Girls, who were massive and really well liked, and then someone who most people had never heard of ... I just found it bonkers. I tried to remember as much as possible, because I knew that I’d never find myself in a situation like that ever again.”At one point, she toured with George Michael, but, bizarrely, never met him. “He’d built an entrance on the front of his dressing room, so that you couldn’t walk past it and see in accidentally. He was obviously just going through a bit where he needed a lot of privacy, for whatever reason.”Did she feel the impact of being so young and under so much scrutiny from the media? “I’d grown up in that environment,” she says. “I learned in that environment. I do think it’s difficult sometimes for women to be given any sort of authority with their work, or for there not to be a question mark over who’s doing what behind the scenes, which I used to find so tedious when I was younger.“When I started, I just felt like everybody assumes that the record company are making decisions for you all the time – you know, before you go and get your fringe cut, you have to go and see the board and ask if it’s OK. But, actually, I think some of that is a slightly misogynistic view, really – that a young woman wouldn’t be able to make her own decisions.”While she is not widely known as a songwriter, she has written or part-written the bulk of her back catalogue. “Sometimes you can feel a bit insecure about the fact that most people assume you’re not doing any of that kind of thing. I was quite sensitive to it.” She learned – for better or for worse – to let it go. “I quickly realised that it wasn’t that relevant to people, if I write or not. The fact of the matter is: my job as a songwriter and my job as a singer are compatible, but they don’t depend on each other. But I don’t really want people wondering about who wrote what. I just want them to get lost in a story. I’ve written the majority of what I’ve done, but I don’t need people to necessarily think about that.”After the success of Groovejet, she released her debut studio album, Read My Lips, in 2001 – for which she brought in musicians including Blur’s Alex James and Moby. She followed it up over the next decade and a half with five more studio albums, all breezy dance-pop records, most of which were big in Europe. In 2019, she released her seventh and most recent musical project, The Song Diaries, an orchestral reworking of her biggest hits.She rarely lets a summer pass without an appearance at a Pride festival (she headlined Birmingham Pride in 2017, London Pride in 2018 and Bristol Pride in 2019) and often tours with the drag collective Sink the Pink. At the mention of how much of the community has been caught up in the recent culture war over gender and transgender rights, she sits up in her chair.“I think we’re now so much better at understanding the spectrum of gender and how people choose to identify and what feels right,” she says. “Of course, that’s so logical. Why on earth should someone say: ‘I need to adhere to that list of gender specifics’?”She is concerned about how gender roles are still imposed on children through consumer culture. “If you look at kids’ toys, it’s very much girls’ toys and boys’ toys, maybe even more than I remember when I was small. I don’t know if it’s some weird fear that, if you give kids lots of choice and let them interpret themselves as they are, then you’re going to encourage some sort of craziness. I think a lot of people feel very uncomfortable about it and I don’t really know why.”On how she has broached the subject of gender identity with her five boys, her answer is simple and matter-of-fact: “I’m not really bothered about what they choose – I just want them to feel like they have choice. I’m sure that’s how most people must feel about raising their kids.“Actually, I do meet some people, even close friends, who are surprisingly traditional in their thinking. I’ve been given my children and I can’t mould anything about them. I’ve just got to support them and love them and try to guide them. And that’s probably why most of them are feral,” she laughs.For the foreseeable future, she will be at home, physically distancing with her husband and their boys. “Now that we’re a few weeks in, I’ve got better at not hanging off the news stuff all the time,” she says. “I feel a bit like I’m on a long-haul flight. The world’s going on out there, but for the time being this is what you’re doing, this is where you are. So you’ve just got to get on with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc581f7612ffce1bcfe6f3ea8e8c76369c835a55/396_224_2487_1493/master/2487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83b4e8cd84336ef9579fd035c3a6133d","title":"cushion mural tributes and an inseparable duo spread joy during coronavirus lockdown","story":"Care home resident’s reaction to ‘precious’ gift lifts spirits, while NHS-inspired paintings brighten businesses in PontefractAmid the gloom of lockdown, there are plenty of people going out of their way to spread joy to others – whether it’s through a simple gift or some colourful painting. Meanwhile Covid-19 survivors have been paying emotional tributes to the NHS staff who helped them pull through.A video showing the moment 94-year-old Ken Benbow receives a cushion from a carer featuring his late wife’s face has gone viral.Benbow was married to his wife Ada for 71 years before she died in 2019, and had been sleeping with framed photo of her every night.One of his carers at Thistleton Lodge in Preston was concerned he might hurt himself on the glass, so printed the image of Ada’s face on to a cushion for Benbow to sleep with at night instead.“I got you a present,” said 17-year-old Kia Mariah Tobin as she presents Benbow with the gift. In the video he immediately hugs the cushion and wells up with tears, before pulling Tobin in for a hug.A second world war veteran, Benbow joined the Royal Navy aged 17 and was involved in the D-Day operations and the preparations to invade Japan before the war ended.Tobin is one of a number of carers who have moved into Thistleton Lodge full-time to help care for the residents. “I live with my Nan and Grandpa at home so it was a bit hard to imagine leaving them. But I’ve sorted things out for them to get food and supplies,” she said.An artist in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, has received worldwide attention after speculation that her colourful NHS tributes were the work of Banksy.She has since revealed herself as Rachel List, a 29-year-old self-employed artist, who creates her murals early in the morning as part of her daily exercise in order to respect social distancing rules.List started painting the murals after a local business called out for an NHS banner, and she has since painted on a number of businesses that have closed during the lockdown. “I want a bit of positivity for them. I want them to thrive again when all this is over,” she said.“I think people just want to show their appreciation for the NHS. Hopefully I have, in some small way, allowed that message to travel.”One of her latest pieces is a tribute to Captain Tom Moore, the war veteran who has raised more than £27m for the NHS by walking laps of his back garden.Her other works have depicted a policeman, and NHS staff with superhero costumes under their uniforms.A couple in their 70s who said they “don’t do apart” have been discharged from hospital after both recovering from Covid-19.Sidney Moore, 77, was treated at Whiston hospital, Merseyside, in a bed alongside his his wife Jean, 76, and the pair are now recovering at home.“It was our wish to face this together and they made sure we could,” Sidney told the St Helens Star.“Jean is hard of hearing so it helped because then we both could understand what was going on and it stopped me worrying about her.”“We’ve never been apart for sixty plus years, we don’t do apart.”The couple were full of praise for the NHS staff who helped them through the virus, with Sidney saying: “It was frightening when we were told we had tested positive, and we were worried that anything could happen, but me and Jean cannot praise everyone enough, everyone from the cleaners to the nurses to the consultants.”Although both are still suffering from a cough and tiredness, they are recovering well at home in Newton-le-Willows, helped out by their son and twin daughters.NHS nurse Uma Pradhan spent 23 days in critical care fighting Covid-19, and as she was moved to another ward to continue her recovery, more than 100 members of staff lined the corridors to applaud her.A video of the scene shows Pradhan being wheeled along in her hospital bed as dozens of staff in facemasks applaud and cheer her while she waves and blows kisses back.Pradhan, a nurse at East Sussex Healthcare Trust, said: “I can’t thank all the staff in critical care enough for everything they have done for me. They are truly amazing. I am still in hospital but progressing every day. Everyone has been fantastic.”“This recovery has been made all the more special given that she is ‘one of our own’.“She is an amazing lady – and a dedicated nurse. One of her first questions when she began to get better was when she could go back to work!“We wish her well – her recovery has given all of us real hope and inspiration during what is an incredibly challenging time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e70cebea50acc9ab82989ca1caa26922d91b3f8f/0_43_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f76940d538c58892a04e7fac367e28d","title":"the best in culture under coronavirus lockdown podcast","story":"Three  critics – Ammar Kalia, Laura Snapes and Sian Cain – join Rachel Humphreys with a guide to the best of television, music and books under lockdown.

Not so long ago, Radio 4’s Today programme was the government’s “Public Enemy No 1”. A media centre of disinformation that needed to be boycotted – preferably shut down completely – because it couldn’t be trusted to allow ministers to tell the first lie that came into their head without some kind of follow-up question or interruption.Since the coronavirus outbreak, Team Boris has had to reconsider its refusal to send ministers on the programme. Even Classic Dom has had to concede that not talking to one of the country’s main outlets is not a good look during a national emergency and has been reluctantly letting ministers out in the wild from time to time.Not that the wild is particularly wild. More like a safari park, as the presenters are so thrilled ministers are no longer an endangered species that they now frequently forget to challenge them. The government can literally send out someone as hopeless as Thérèse Coffey on Today and be fairly sure it won’t come unstuck.How things change, part two. Before Christmas, Piers Morgan was the bete noire of every bleeding-heart liberal. The gobshite Good Morning Britain presenter who shouted down any remainers complaining about the government’s absence of any credible Brexit plan as unpatriotic remoaners. Just suck it up, losers. OK, so Boris Johnson would rather hide in the fridge than talk to Morgan, but a lot of us must have had days like that.Now, though, Morgan has become the voice of a country that is increasingly angry and confused about the way the government has so badly mismanaged the coronavirus pandemic. The everyman who isn’t afraid to use what power he has to call out bullshit and incompetence for what it is. A kind of national group therapy for all those of us who feel powerless.What he does is not so much interview junior ministers – the government has wisely and determinedly kept all its big guns away from Morgan ITV could clean up with Morgan v Priti Patel on pay-per-view – as harangue and shout at them with all the pent-up fury of someone who doesn’t understand why those in power aren’t more bothered that 1,000 additional people have died in the previous 24 hours. The best that any minister can hope for is to survive the barrage without post-traumatic stress disorder.The luckless Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, was Monday morning’s government sacrificial lamb for the media round. Luckless, because Dowden was never groomed for a cabinet post. He was the perpetual Number Three. A deputy senior prefect at school. The most junior of ministers in government who could barely be trusted to carry a file from one end of Whitehall to the other. A man so dull and ineffective that even his shadow has tried to disown him. That he is now in the cabinet speaks more of the quality of the others than any talents Dowden has so far kept well-hidden.Dowden warmed up with what he hoped would be an easy gig on BBC Breakfast with the nice-but-dim Dan Walker, the sports reporter turned chat show host whose questions generally make Graham Norton sound like Andrew Neil.Instead, he got the much sharper Louise Minchin, who rattled off a whole load of questions on the absent personal protective equipment and the failure of Johnson to bother to turn up to five Cobra meetings, without making the slightest pretence of engaging with the answers. Because she, like us, knew he didn’t have any. “Thank you, Olivia,” she said, concluding the interview. That’s how little impression Dowden had made on her. She couldn’t even remember his name. Or if he identified as a man or a woman.Over on Good Morning Britain, after a few warm-up punches from Susanna Reid – all of which took their toll – Morgan went in for the kill. First he asked how many NHS and care workers had died. “43,” Dowden said confidently.Actually it was 80, said Morgan, illustrating his assertion by holding up a double-page spread from a morning paper that clearly the minister hadn’t been bothered to read.Hell, it was early and it wasn’t like he had a serious job where it was his business to know the news. OK, Morgan continued. How many care home residents had died? “217,” Dowden replied. Er ... how about 7,500? Morgan said incredulously. Dowden looked like he might burst into tears.That was only just for starters though. Dowden was pummelled and kicked with questions on everything from the government’s insistence it had been brilliantly prepared for the pandemic, to its selective use of scientific data and potentially life-threatening decision to allow the Cheltenham festival to go ahead on 16-19 March.Dowden’s mouth merely opened and closed noiselessly. Every time he tried to come up with some half-truth or excuse, Morgan slammed him back on the ropes. We learned nothing, but then Dowden knows nothing. But it was cracking entertainment.Moments later, Dowden went on the Today programme for some light rest and recuperation before getting another going over from Nick Ferrari, another interviewer who doesn’t take prisoners, on LBC radio.By the end, Dowden could barely remember his own name. Before going back to hide under the duvet, he made one last call to No 10. “Never again,” he begged. “Please let me do the 5pm press conference instead. That’s a complete doddle compared to this.” Raab just laughed and put down the phone. Meanwhile, Dowden went on a fruitless search for what was left of his self-worth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0c704430ee89c0e28770123134f8eaf451a5e4f/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d58e20e672dec803c59c9f4de27e5e4","title":"scientists join calls for uk public to wear homemade face masks outdoors","story":"Old T-shirt combined with kitchen paper enough to help reduce spread of coronavirusThe public should wear homemade masks when they venture outdoors to help reduce the spread of coronavirus, according to scientists who claim Britain’s masks policy does too little to prevent infections.Prof Sian Griffiths, who led the Hong Kong government’s investigation into the 2003 Sars epidemic, said Britain should adopt the same approach as the US, where people are advised to make their own “cloth face coverings” and wear them in public spaces.Trish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care health sciences at Oxford University who recently completed a review on face masks, also advocated the use of masks in public and suggested an old T-shirt combined with kitchen paper would suffice.The US policy is being directed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is designed to reduce at least some transmission of the virus while preventing a run on medical-grade masks needed by frontline health workers.“The CDC advice in the US is pragmatic,” Griffiths said. “It recognises both the need to ensure the supply of masks for clinical situations where they are obviously needed at the same time as recognising that there could potentially be benefits in wearing ‘masks’ in public to prevent passing on the infection.”The government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) met on Tuesday to review the evidence on wearing face masks.  understands that the group is split on the best policy to adopt because the evidence is so weak.Ministers are deeply reluctant to recommend the use of even homemade masks amid concerns that people will rush to buy medical masks and leave the NHS facing even greater supply shortages.Public Health England recommends face masks for the NHS and in social care settings but does not advise healthy people to wear them outside. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines state that while masks can help prevent people from passing on coronavirus, they are inadequate protection on their own from contracting it.Greenhalgh, on the back of a review on face masks, said homemade versions could dramatically reduce the amount of droplets sprayed from people’s mouths, which can carry the virus if the person is infected.She added: “The public should not and must not ert medical-grade supplies.”There is growing unease over the government’s reluctance to recommend the use of face masks. Doctors across the UK have now backed the Masks4AllUK movement, which argues that people should wear homemade masks when they go out.At a press conference on Friday, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said that while Sage would look at the evidence, it was “absolutely crucial” that masks were available in hospitals and other high-risk transmission areas.Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents healthcare trusts across England, said the impact on the NHS must be fully assessed. “Fluid-repellent masks for health and care staff are key to safety and to avoid the spread of coronavirus,” he said.“Securing the supply of masks, when there is huge global demand, is crucial. This must be a key consideration for government. There needs to be clear evidence that wearing masks, along with other measures, will deliver significant enough benefits to take us out of lockdown to potentially jeopardise NHS mask supply.”Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who chairs an independent advisory group to the WHO emergencies programme that is managing the Covid-19 pandemic, said the purpose of wearing face masks was to prevent the wearer from spreading the virus if they were infected themselves.“Masks should not be worn by the general public to protect themselves as there is evidence that masks do not prevent infection by other respiratory infections such as flu,” he said.“The best way that the general public can support government policy is to understand how to protect themselves and protect others if they are sick or believe they may be infected. This is by physical distancing, social distancing and frequent handwashing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf69f983b408b357f4556f66bd56355919eeedc5/0_154_4699_2819/master/4699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddd2260c661665620a1cf5e3b4ac6ffa","title":"coronavirus improved welfare system no going back","story":"The DWP may be slightly less punitive, but the social security system is still nasty and painfully outdatedThis has been an unusually positive couple of weeks for universal credit. Despite a tsunami of new claims – 1.4m and counting – and the loss of a fifth of staff due to self-isolation, the much-maligned benefit has held up under the challenge of coronavirus. The system hasn’t crashed, and, thanks to the rapid redeployment of tens of thousands of officials from their usual roles to full-time claims processing, the “pandemic” cohort of new claimants is expected to receive their first benefit payments, on time, this week.The director general of universal credit, Neil Couling, has been in confident mood, going as far as to call a Zoom-enabled press briefing last week to praise his hardworking staff and lay bets that, despite the unprecedented economic chaos of the past few weeks, universal credit would be more timely and efficient than ever. “The system has run beautifully throughout the crisis,” he claimed, not a phrase too often associated with the often hapless benefit.Part of the reason the UK’s social security system has managed to deliver its immediate overriding priority – to get emergency cash as swiftly as it can to millions left jobless overnight – is because, by and large, it has stopped doing almost everything else. The vast architecture of conditionality, from job search interviews to sanctions to fit-for-work tests has been put aside for at least three months, making the system unexpectedly lean. It will be interesting to see what the new claimant cohort makes of it (the work and pensions select committee is conducting an inquiry): in some ways forcibly changed by Covid-19, it is on the face of it, both more generous (by £20 a week) and less punitive than it was even a month ago. In important respects, however, universal credit and the wider benefit system remain frustratingly unreformed. The UK is moving into what looks like a lengthy economic downturn, and already there are signs that low-income families are struggling. The Food Foundation thinktank estimates that levels of food insecurity have quadrupled under lockdown, with disabled people and families with children likely to be disproportionately affected. Food banks have reported huge increases in demand. Mitigating poverty, Labour says, must be a major part of the post-Covid welfare policy response. There are plenty of things the government could do to ease the impact on the poorest people, not least by overhauling a welfare system scarred by always nasty and now painfully outdated policies. So scrap the two-child benefit limit, with its poverty-fuelling detachment of benefit levels from family need do away with the benefit cap, which punishes claimants for not getting a job, even where they are not expected to work. It also should review the rollout of the next phase of universal credit to existing claimants from December, a process so fraught that the Salvation Army warned just two months ago that, unreformed, it would “steamroll vulnerable people into poverty”.Universal credit appears to have survived the initial crisis of lockdown intact because the DWP realised quickly enough that business as usual would not have worked in a crisis of this magnitude. Times have changed. Old habits die hard. But there is no going back to the old ways. Generosity, fairness and ease of access must be the new watchwords.• Patrick Butler is the ’s social policy editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38d11e7c286333727e4aec3650e56d06b8b0c93/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f4ced35024bc1074b393a2d9ed986f9","title":"people drinking a lot frontline workers britain coronavirus lockdown","story":"Key workers who spoke to the  two weeks ago give us an update on their experiencesTwo weeks ago key workers spoke to the  about their experiences during the coronavirus outbreak. Now, they tell us how things have changed, as the country endures another three weeks of lockdown.We’re just as busy as we ever have been. Friendship issues and family disagreements are all escalated because of the lockdown. Friendship issues are more difficult to resolve because they can’t talk face to face which causes misunderstandings. Family members are now spending more time together.Normally as a supervisor you have other things going on, managing volunteers, training people, interviewing for new volunteers, things like that. Now I’m just working shifts, often back to back. This is like going back to basics, just making sure the core service is still running. Our volunteers are brilliant, normally they give up four hours a week for a shift, but some have been coming in three times a week or after work. We still have to come into the office because the calls system can’t be operated from home.But we have to work out ways of doing other things, otherwise there won’t be a service. Volunteers are constantly changing, it’s like a leaky bucket: one leaves as the other comes. So if we don’t train and recruit, we won’t have any volunteers.Before we just had a low door between us and the passengers, but now there are pieces of floppy plastic which hang down from the ceiling like a shower curtain, as a barrier between us. One passenger said I looked like a piece of cake covered in cling film. The problem with the curtains is that they’re all the same size, and buses aren’t, so some fit and others flop in the breeze while you’re driving because the ceiling is too high. This means on some buses, you can’t keep the window open, which isn’t very safe as I try to keep maximum air flow so I’m not breathing in what passengers are breathing out.I can see that elderly people and people who live in small houses on the local council estates have been worse hit by the lockdown. Getting online and home delivery is fantasy for elderly people – they don’t have computersand don’t know how to use them, so they have to take the bus to get food. People from worse-off backgrounds don’t have big fridges to stockpile, so they have to go to the shops regularly too.The roads have got busier again since Boris Johnson came out of hospital. When he went into intensive care, there was a drop in the number of people around, I think they took it more seriously. But now there are a huge number of people around, and its slowly started to build up.Our residents are doing great, we had a big outdoor concert yesterday. We had a measuring tape out making sure all the seats were two metres apart, and entertainers. We broadcast it live on Facebook for families to watch.I moved into the care home last week. It reduces the risk of me bringing in coronavirus. Someone near our house died from it, so it seems like a sensible thing to do. Last week I changed all of the staff shifts from seven hours to 12 hours, to restrict the number of times staff are in and out of the building. I know another care home who’ve had 15 staff members off sick and two deaths, but luckily we haven’t had any staff off or any infection. I think that’s to do with the cleaning procedures we had originally. For example, before we opened we spent £2,500 on a mopping system, which means we have good quality mops, and different ones for different sections, so they never cross over.We also tried to get ahead, and closed the home very early. The staff always go above and beyond, too.We’re only allowed 40 people in the store, but when you’ve got another five staff members on the till and six on the shop floor, that’s a lot of people at any one time.Abuse to staff seems to have increased much more since coronavirus, but perhaps I just notice it more as there are fewer people on the shop floor. Alcohol has been flying off the shelves. Because people aren’t going out, they have more money to spend, and there’s no pubs so everyone’s drinking at home– and, from what I can see, drinking quite a lot.The car park is full again, so the wildlife is gone. There’s not a lot of panic about it any more. I’d rather people do a trolley dash, but as there’s nothing else to do, and supermarkets are one of the only places still open, it’s leisure time.Some people are still taking it seriously. A lady came in spraying Dettol all over her bag, her purchases, and because I was behind the till, all over me. It’s also strange being surrounded by people in masks, it’s like every dystopian film coming to life.It’s still really busy. We’re having lots of complaints from vulnerable and elderly people who are meant to be given a slot to get food, but they’re all saying they can’t get a delivery in for three weeks. It’s causing a lot of problems, and making them go out to do shopping if they haven’t got anyone to do it for them.People appreciate that food is getting to them, but there’s still a massive shortage of products so we have to make lots of replacements. In store, the problem is that online shopping takes a lot of stuff off the shelves in the morning, so when the store opens it’s already gone and you’re going into an empty store. At our depot, the frames where we sort and prepare mail for delivery have been moved apart to enable better social distancing. This is a very welcome change. Beforehand the tight conditions made any interaction a risk and this was causing increased stress among our staff, causing some to go absent. There have also been two confirmed cases of the virus at work, but no flag has been raised over who or what they were in contact with before it was confirmed.Despite this, it feels great to be out on delivery and have people thank you and cheer you on. Considering the unprecedented nature of this crisis, adapting to it has been relatively straightforward. And you can forget how strange it is. Having the public acknowledge the hard efforts of our service is the juice that keeps me going.In and amongst the collective mood of uncertainty, there are jewels to be witnessed as a postman : neighbours sharing a slice of cake for breakfast in their respective front gardens, and joining in with children playing hopscotch that they’ve colourfully drawn in chalk on the streets.One hopes when this period has passed, we might retain some of these tender moments of connection seen between people and their communities.It’s a lot busier now and I’m exhausted. We’re doing five or six, mostly Covid, burials a day and digging continuously in between. There are no breaks. The PPE is running out now – we still have masks but the overalls are in shorter supply. Without new stuff we will run out this week.The niceties of the job have gone and we have to ask people attending burials to step back and stay away from us. It’s hard – it should be about dignity and providing a caring space but it’s life or death potentially. I need to protect myself and my colleagues.People say I’m lucky to still be going out to work and I can understand the creeping madness of staying in but they don’t know what work is like for me. If people aren’t social distancing, I get angry – I’m not happy with the way I’m behaving.I don’t know what day of the week it is any more – I go to work and come home and it’s like a tunnel. I spend most of my days staring into a small dark hole. It’s like a bad version of Groundhog Day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/441ac4a550fd5b24375f0a804b0636da6cce5227/0_248_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f7afc3799fad71329cd0a6e3fe79d58","title":"my favourite game andy murray v novak djokovic us open 2012 tennis","story":"The kid from Dunblane ended Britain’s 76-year wait for a male major tennis champion in one of the great Flushing Meadows finals“Just take that ball and ride it baby,” said Boris Becker in the commentary booth at Flushing Meadows. The man too good not to win a major, Andy Murray, was leading 7-6, 4-0. The excitement turned Becker’s head and brought a finish line into view that had eluded Murray four times already.Murray was comfortably ahead but each point had to be torn from Novak Djokovic’s grasp. The US Open’s defending champion would make the Scot fight for four hours and 54 minutes of brutal hitting that left both limping. The Scot began well in the windy conditions, a recently beaten Wimbledon finalist but now an Olympic champion after gaining revenge at SW19 over Roger Federer. The huge outpouring of emotion for Murray as he took gold had seemed to render him calmer on court in the US while Djokovic smashed a racket as he fought gusts that threw his game out of whack in the opener. A 54-shot rally, the longest at the tournament, was the highlight before the match caught fire in the tie-break.Murray needed six set points, a winner that made Sean Connery get out of his seat, and all of his lung-busting retrieval skills to clinch the tie-break 12-10. There were unforced errors on both sides of the net but Murray took the role of aggressor after surrendering the mini-break early on. He pinned Djokovic behind the baseline with the greater depth of shot and finally cracked the Serb after 87 minutes.Greg Rusedski, courtside, said it was “the best tie-break I have ever seen” while Mark Petchey was stunned. “It is unthinkable we will have to watch another five sets of this.” Unlucky, Mark.Murray stayed aggressive. The chuntering was at a minimum and the leg clutching had not yet begun. The first of these inevitably came after surrendering a double break for 5-5 in the second, with Djokovic finally finding his rhythm. The first sign of weakness in Murray showed showed and it all seemed painfully familiar. But he shrugged off the tentative lapse and held serve, crucially winning a 30-shot rally after trailing 0-15. He would assert himself once more, after Djokovic crumbled with a missed smash, to take a two-set lead. Unfamiliar territory and the drama was only just beginning.We were watching the ultimate grind artist after all, though, and it was never going to be that easy. Djokovic had been given licence to swing and had snapped up the third 6-2.The cat-and-mouse game continued with Djokovic now the dominant force. A break for the Serb straight away saw Murray’s head drop further, his limp more exaggerated and anguish painfully evident. But the whiplash-inducing ebb and flow continued with a break back from Murray only to be shattered again by Djokovic. They were going the distance.Djokovic looked drained after the monumental effort that dragged him level. Murray pounced, with a net cord gifting him an early break. The quality rose once more, with neither man now prepared to trade on the counter-attack. Murray found his depth and began to dismantle the Serb. A vital hold to love at 4-2 saved energy to snatch another break for 5-2. Djokovic took a medical timeout and had Murray bouncing at the back of the court, waiting to end the curse of ‘supposed to’.He settled down with a rally against the back wall. A handful of serves, one ripped return out the back of the court and it was done, 7-6, 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2. The kid from Dunblane had ended Britain’s 76-year wait for a male major champion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1114a08c3a4cc03c4612f1889eee0a9aadd08e3f/0_182_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e3d9215d205459940eabef8ebbcedbe","title":"nothing would give me more pleasure captain moore to visit mclaren hq","story":"McLaren’s Lando Norris has invited Captain Tom Moore to visit their headquarters in Woking once the lockdown is lifted as he congratulated the 99-year-old on his mammoth fundraising effort for the NHS.Moore, a veteran of the second world war, has raised more than £27.5m for the NHS Charities Together and the fight against coronavirus by walking lengths of his gardenHe could also be on his way to the top of the music charts with a recording of You’ll Never Walk Alone with Michael Ball.Moore is a long-time motorsport fan and received a call from the driver at the weekend. “I want to say a big congratulations for what you’ve achieved,” Norris told Moore in a video of the call released by his family on Twitter. “I’m sure you’ve been told many times but … from my side and everyone and McLaren we want to say a big congratulations for what you’ve done.“It’s my honour that I get to speak to people like you, Captain Tom.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

With so many hours to fill, it seemed like a sensible investment. Pretty soon, it was infiltrating my every waking hour. By  Sophie ElmhirstA few weeks ago, on a day that was probably like today now that the days are all frighteningly different and yet strangely the same, Disney launched Disney+, its new streaming service, in the UK. The precise date, for those that are still tracking such things, was 24 March, which was also, by coincidence, the date the British lockdown officially started. I had been waiting, impatiently, for both. One felt frivolous, the other historic – a new thing to watch to add to the endless other things to watch versus the sudden transformation of an entire population’s way of life – and yet here they were entwined, perfectly compatible bedfellows.Disney couldn’t have known that the launch of Disney+ would fall upon the same day that 66 million people would be instructed to stay at home for 23 hours a day. They must have set their launch date months ago, long before the first coronavirus case hit Britain, or travellers returned from their fateful half-term Italian skiing holidays, or the prime minister glad-handed his way around a hospital. But to the cynical, it felt like the workings of a darkly prescient marketing strategy. I mean, the timing was ideal. Someone, somewhere in the Disney multiverse must have celebrated – shyly, inappropriately, a quiet elbow bump in a meeting room, perhaps.For anyone with a thing for family-friendly entertainment, the prospect of Disney+ was inviting. But for those of us coming to terms with home schooling and Easter “holidays”, followed by yet more home schooling, days upon weeks upon days of time – and not the kind of time you can revel in, but time that would be filled with fear for the wellbeing of people you love, and panic at the conundrum of trying to earn a living and look after your kids – well for us, the launch of Disney+ was a goddamn digital miracle.Maybe it didn’t feel like that for everyone. Maybe the parents who secretly love the home schooling vibe, the timetables and worksheets, the children sitting happily at kitchen tables, tongues sticking out of the side of their mouths as they complete little astronomy quizzes while the parent stirs a healthy stew, maybe they didn’t sign up for Disney+ a full week before it launched. For the rest of us, hurling fish fingers into the oven with one hand while trying to tap out a piece of work with the other and break up a fight with a toe, the relatively low cost of a Disney+ subscription (£5.99 a month) when contemplating the long, long, just so very long, period of time ahead of us, felt like a sensible investment.Sure, there’s other TV. There’s the BBC. There’s Netflix. I dabble in it all, unfussy when it comes to shiny, child-absorbing entertainment. But Disney+ is a luxury bath of content, of Disney old and new. When you log on to its sleek black home page, it shows off its wares so easily: thumbnails of Toy Story 4 and the new Star Wars spin-off series, The Mandalorian, casually sitting next to each other like reunited friends from different planets. The animated classics are all there – Cinderella, The Lion King, Aladdin – accompanied by their “reimagined” live-action versions, updated and often unambiguously ruined. But there are also hidden treats, movies you’d forgotten exist but sentimentally love more than members of your family (Cool Runnings). There’s an entire section devoted to nostalgia. Three Men and A Little Lady? Yes, please. Nestling among it all is almost the entire back catalogue of The Simpsons, more than 600 episodes, patiently waiting to swallow the rest of your life.Some early adopters have quibbled that once you get past The Mandalorian and a few other new offerings (Meghan Markle narrating the nausea-inducing nature “documentary” Elephant, anyone?), there’s not much to go on, but perhaps they don’t have kids happy to watch the same movie until they can recite it by heart. At some point, my husband put on the 2008 movie Bolt, about a run-of-the-mill little white dog, voiced by John Travolta, who is under the false impression that he is a superhero. A bulletproof concept, and sure enough, the movie went down so well that my kids, aged six and three, requested to rewatch it the moment the credits rolled. Forget awards, forget reviews: there is no better compliment a movie can receive than the immediate need a child can feel to watch it again. I remember that feeling. We wallpaper our souls with this stuff.Disney has been colonising the minds and hearts of children for decades. Wade through Disney+ as an adult and you find that, inevitably, some of the movies aren’t as flawless as you recall, but you also find yourself blinking rapidly, at the mercy of a cinematic formula that knows the synaptic shortcut to both your childhood memories and your tear ducts. The nostalgia section – delivered at a time when reality can be hard to stomach and worries rise at unexpected times of the night – has the calming effect of one of those weighted anxiety blankets. When the outside world has shut down, you can burrow inwards and time travel through whatever anachronistic creation – Hannah Montana, Boy Meets World, DuckTales – transports you to your younger self, when you watched TV on a sofa you didn’t have to buy with your own money, and someone else was doing most of the worrying so you could eat toast and think only about what you might eat after the toast.So yes, I admit it. I subscribed to Disney+ on the pretext of occupying my kids, but of course – of course – I actually bought it for myself.We began our Disney+ immersion, out of respect, with the canon. It happened to be the week my husband had the virus mildly, days he spent mostly unconscious except when he rose from his sweat pool to recount the plotlines of his hallucinatory nightmares. With a cursory nod to the abandoned ideals of home schooling, I decided to embrace Disney+ with a certain academic rigour. We started at the beginning, and worked our way through Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940), before making a leap forward to Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953) and Sleeping Beauty (1959). Not all on the same day, I should add, but I’m not going to lie: the viewing schedule was intense.In many ways, this part felt like duty: ticking off the fundamentals before we could get on to the good stuff. In the early movies, the animators are so deferential to their source material that the “action” starts with an ancient book of the tale being opened, its pages of gothic script and hand-drawn pictures very slowly turned, as a sonorous male voice earnestly narrates the story. “Come ON,” my six-year-old yelled at the television, used to a more intense fix of cortisol to propel her through her entertainment.The animation itself is disconcertingly 2D, but from the off, you can’t help credit Disney with its sheer devotion to its own shtick. Snow White might be almost featureless in her aesthetic simplicity, like a particularly extreme Botox victim, but that winning alchemy of cute animal friends and tuneful songs, adorable eyes and tightly waisted dresses, is all there in 1937 just as it’s there, still, in Frozen 2, 82 years later. There are some formulas so reliable that nothing needs to change, except the sheer variety of associated merchandise.Inevitably, there are some jarringly anachronistic moments. Many of the early films have a warning at the start that they contain images of smoking. (In one comic set piece in Pinocchio, a cute fish blows thick grey smoke rings out of its bowl, an image that really wouldn’t fly nowadays.) The age of Disney’s heroines being symbols of women’s empowerment is still some way off – many of the early female leads share a kind of saccharine fragility that would make Moana scoff from her one-woman sailing mission. And there are episodes of flat-out racism, too. Peter Pan, for example, has a physically-painful-to-watch number about Native Americans, called What Made The Red Man Red. Disney has added a euphemistic disclaimer to Peter Pan and other movies containing similar disasters: “This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.” The most egregious example of all – Song of the South, from 1946, set on an uncritically idealised plantation and ridden with stereotypes – has been kept off the service altogether.Aside from their missteps, the early movies contain moments that ring oddly true in a pandemic. While my kids protested at the lethargic pace of Alice in Wonderland, I found myself absurdly over-identifying with her Wonderland experience, a place where things seem superficially familiar but are fundamentally altered. Near the end, Alice reaches a door through which she can see herself sleeping: “But that’s me! I’m asleep! Alice, wake up! Please wake up, Alice!” Who hasn’t felt like that, these past weeks? Not just the whole living-nightmare scenario, but that particular dissociation of constantly seeing yourself in the corner of a laptop screen while you try and listen to someone else talk. Wake up, I want to say to myself. Stop looking at yourself! Wake up!Enough cartoons: we were ready for real people. One eternal Saturday, though it could have been a Sunday or a Tuesday, or any of the other “days”, I decided it was time. The kids had ravaged their way semi-dismissively through the old animations and plenty of the new ones were already as familiar to them as their own beating hearts: no one in this flat needs to watch Frozen again. At this point, Bolt was already on its fourth viewing, and had infiltrated many aspects of our lives. Our football had been renamed after the deluded dog and, like Wilson in Cast Away, become our beloved inanimate pet. In a distinct bid for freedom from each other and their parents, the kids had built their own cushion-walled enclaves at opposite ends of our flat, both of which were guarded by soft-toy dogs, also called Bolt. Before Bolt became the only name my son would answer to, I decided it was time to move my offspring forward in their cultural education, to expose them to one of the great artefacts of the late 80s, to a piece of cinema that will stand the test not just of its time, but all time. It was time to watch Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.Jesus, the opening shot. A mailman delivers letters down an anytown residential street, and it is the fantasy version of American suburbia in its absolute blue-skied, big-shirted, ice-cream-sundae heyday. I can’t tell you how much, aged 12, I wanted to live in one of these clapboard houses, with a white picket fence and grass on either side of the sidewalk, with kids on bikes in the middle of the street and mailboxes at the end of the front path. I think I still do. In Honey, there are so many period-specific elements that seem designed to spark joy: a woozy saxophone soundtrack, those round foamy headphones, one of those long spiral cords from a phone attached to the kitchen wall in which characters get tangled, baseball caps and lumberjack shirts, collared sweaters with the collars up. For the kids, it was like watching a movie about the Victorians: the funny costumes! The funny cars! But for me, it was like falling back in love with someone I’d forgotten existed. I went deep, losing myself not just in reminiscence or a fresh appreciation of superlative film-making, but in the movie’s surprising thematic relevance to our current state. (Apologies in advance.)For the unfortunate minority unfamiliar with the plot of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids – well, it’s all in the title, my friends. The cast includes a wacky scientist dad (an irrepressible Rick Moranis as Wayne Szalinski), a long-suffering mum, two kids, the neighbours and their two kids, and a crucial dog called Quark. When Szalinski is out one day, all four kids are accidentally shrunk by his shrinking machine in the attic. When I say shrunk, I mean shrunk. They’re tiny. Significantly smaller than Lego men. Smaller than ants. At some point they actually encounter an ant and it appears elephantine. Later, they ride it. Crucially, no one can hear them – their parents think their kids have gone missing and call the police. There’s a tragic moment when Szalinski comes home from the shops, can’t hear them screaming at him in the attic, and then smashes up the shrinking machine on which he believes he’s wasted years of his life. As the screws start to fall, not only is he destroying a miracle machine that we now know works – the dramatic irony! – but he’s endangering four children’s lives as debris rains down on their heads. He then unknowingly sweeps them up and dumps them in a rubbish bag at the end of the garden.So begins this particular Odyssey. Honey is a classic journey movie: but instead of Revenant-ing across wilderness, or 1917-ing through the trenches, the kids have to traverse a back garden to get home. Don’t, for a second, doubt the scale of this challenge. When they rip open the rubbish bag and look at the jungle of grass they have to cross, it is a shattering sight. Much of the threat relies on the excellent effects. A butterfly flies overhead, and its wings beat and throb like a military helicopter. A monstrous dead beetle floats down a trickle of dirty water that resembles the Amazon. There’s a swarm of bees: pure horror.To cut a predictable story short, they make it, only for one of them to end up on Szalinski’s spoon and almost get eaten with a mouthful of Cheerios. But eventually they are restored to normal size and all ends well. As with any good Disney film, all sorts of lessons have been learned along the way, such as teamwork, taking care of siblings, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and not having to be manly in the traditional sense. Disney dishes up its little morals so expertly, with a wink and joke, that we just drink them down like milkshake.As with everything, I struggled to rewatch Honey without making questionable comparisons to our current situation. Not to get excessively earnest about a movie charting the unique risks involved in constructing a machine that can without your knowledge reduce your children to the size of breadcrumbs, but it was striking how ultra-vulnerable these kids suddenly were, cowed by forces in nature far greater than them. Being human wasn’t a power any more, it was a weakness. On this scale, an ant can have dominion. Of course, the kids befriend the ant, grow to love and respect it, and when the ant has a fight with a giant beetle and dies defending the kids from its attack, the bully kid breaks down in tears. Lessons learned: the bully was dependent on a fellow creature he’d barely noticed before, and might even have stamped on. The very creature who protected him was the one to lose its life in the process. We have to look after each other to survive. We all lose creatures we love.Proudest parenting moment of lockdown so far? When the six-year-old requested to watch Honey, I Shrunk the Kids for a second time. If that is the peak of my home schooling efforts, which it undoubtedly is, I’ll take it. As for this great parable for our age, well, a reboot is in the works – according to the film site IMDb, Shrunk is a thing. Who knows if it will happen, given that Disney has had to halt production on possibly higher-priority projects such as a live-action Little Mermaid and four Avatar sequels. But I have faith. By the time Shrunk gets made, we’ll probably have rushed back to our old habits and humanity will be cruising to oblivion again. Or maybe Shrunk will appear just in time to remind us of our essential vulnerability and human co-dependency. It’s possible, I realise, that I’m overstating the future power of Shrunk, but you never know.Deep in the bowels of Disney+, a clutch of self-serving documentaries reveal how drunk the company has become on its own myth over the years. The Imagineering Story (first episode: “The Happiest Place on Earth”) tells us the story of Walt Disney, a father of two daughters who first drew Mickey Mouse on a train journey and based his first design for Disneyland on his hometown of Marceline, Missouri. We meet, too, the “Imagineers”: people tasked with making new attractions at Disney’s theme parks. “Creating happiness is hard work,” croons Angela Bassett in the voiceover. “Only a unique army of people is equipped to undertake such an enterprise. Since its inception, this merry band of misfits has defied the odds.” Did she really just say “this merry band of misfits”? Yes, she did.Another Disney-on-Disney documentary, called One Day at Disney, zooms in on a selection of employees, including Mark, who is almost moved to tears by his own life story – from being a train obsessive as a kid to running the steam train service at Disneyland, California. That’s the way all the character arcs go in One Day at Disney, sculpted into the kind of perfect Disney shape that strongly resembles the now almost blackly comic notion of the American dream: I had a passion, I worked hard, my dream became a reality, and now the physical and emotional health of myself and my family, my entire life, really, is owned by a thumpingly profitable corporation.All the Disney documentaries feature Bob Iger, Disney’s outgoing CEO, who likes to tell his own neatly crafted story, from how he started out 45 years ago earning $150 a week at ABC before rising to the top through sheer hard work and optimism. Iger always appears grandfatherly, in cable-knit sweaters and cosy cardigans, with deep grooves that fan out round his eyes gained by years of smiling in the service of corporate warmth. He often says things like: “We’re all trying to do the same thing, in very compelling ways: we’re trying to touch people’s hearts.”During Iger’s reign, Disney has become the entertainment behemoth of our age, acquiring Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm (and thus Star Wars) and 21st Century Fox among others. The company now owns so much of the entertainment landscape that it can function like surround sound. There have been strings of mega-hits: last year alone included Toy Story 4, Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2 contributing to a total box office haul of $11bn. Iger has been vastly rewarded for his efforts: in 2019, he earned $48m. The year before, he earned $65.7m, more than 1,000 times the median salary – about $46,000 – of all Disney employees. Many of Disney’s workers, like those who filed a class action lawsuit in California’s superior court last December, earn less than $15 an hour.The triumphant launch of Disney+ was supposed to be Iger’s closing flourish, a final high-five as he left the building. The early signs were good. Pre-launch, Disney had established a target of 60 to 90 million subscribers by 2024. On 9 April 2020, the company announced it had already hit 50 million. (It took Netflix seven years to reach that point.) As Iger’s retirement approached, there was persistent chatter in the media about him running for president, rumours he eventually had to deny publicly. But just as his character journey was coming to its satisfying close, the story changed. By late March, most of Disney’s operations were suspended due to coronavirus. Disney had lost a third of its market value, $78.5bn, in the space of a month. Iger wasn’t going anywhere, but staying on to help his successor, Bob Chapek.In the long run, unlike many of its employees, thousands of whom have been furloughed, Disney itself will be just fine. Rightly, the company isn’t high on anyone’s worry list. But it’s striking how far the current reality of Disney is from its well tended corporate image. In late March, various news outlets published pictures of Disney’s closed theme parks – empty car parks, rollercoasters, cafes, golf courses and a lonely-looking Millennium Falcon at Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge. The photographs are somehow more sinister than those of empty cities that have been doing the rounds. Cities, at the best of times, are conflicted and messy, beautiful and cruel. They rarely pretend to be anything they’re not, unless there’s an Olympics going on.Disney, on the other hand, is always pretending to be something it’s not: it is a highly efficient profit machine that presents itself as a place where a merry band of misfits conjure happiness. Its theme parks are places constructed for children and commerce, and the optimised interplay of those two things, but in these images they look ghostly, frozen in time like the cursed inhabitants of the castle in Sleeping Beauty, still technically in existence but, in the absence of anything animate, turned into the lifeless sets of a horror movie. I doubt, somehow, that this is what Disney’s “Imagineers” had in mind.On some days, when we’ve been outside in the weird quiet and heard only birds and sirens, the line between fantasy and reality feels pretty blurred. The world doesn’t look real something to do with the clean sunlight, the blossom, the way everyone walks around under a glaze of heightened self-awareness. There is deceptive peace, when we know, just around the corner, there is the opposite. We lurch between learning of the cruellest of realities, and feasting on fantasy to distract ourselves. Sometimes, emerging from a Disney haze, I wish I’d stayed in the hard reality, because then at least you don’t have to wake up from it.Kids are instructive, somehow able to navigate this time with a bracing honesty that adults nervously evade. There are ups and downs, sure: there are escape fantasies and berserk, semi-violent frustrations born of unchanging close-quarters proximity, but then they seem able to reset. Snacks help. So do lavatorial jokes. Or some sort of half-arsed slide made out of sofa cushions. A mood can descend and then pass like a rain shower, rather than descend and fester, which seems to be their parents’ preference.Also, distraction isn’t distraction for them: it’s occupation, it’s life. When I interrupt the three-year-old in one of his deep-play sessions, something to do with small figures either warring or performing intricate stunts on Lego motorbikes, he looks at me sternly and says: “I’m busy.” Meanwhile, the disapproving label of “screen time” does a gross injustice to the six-year-old’s capacity to immerse herself in a film. Watching her watching Bolt for the seventh time is like watching an athlete, a formidable effort of concentration that blocks out all external noise, attempts at conversation, offers of food.Disney+, inevitably, stole her heart. I could tell it from the moment I saw her face during that opening ident – the shooting star over the Disney castle, the background sky sunset-pink. They know what they’re doing, these people: even the branding gives you an endorphin hit. During that seventh Bolt viewing, I realised why the kids wanted to keep watching the same movie over and over again. There’s the expert appreciation for a fine piece of computer animation, no doubt, but there’s also the deep comfort to be found in repeat viewing. Even multiple screenings in, they both covered their eyes in terror during a chase scene. The fear was real, but it was that pleasurable kind of fear you know will pass. There’s no uncertainty, no risk. You know, for a fact, that everything will be OK. It’s fear with a happy ending.Some sad, jaded part of me wanted to point out to my kids the degree to which life, especially right now, is not at all like a Disney movie. But what would be the purpose when we were here surrendering to a Disney movie precisely for its moral consolations, for its rewarding of the good and punishment of the bad, for the right things happening to the right people in the end. We could watch, godlike, in the safety of foreknowledge. At the movie’s dramatic climax – spoiler alert – when Bolt rescues his beloved owner from a raging fire and they both fall unconscious, my daughter turned to me and said reassuringly, with the wisdom of hard-won experience and the beautiful relief of knowing the future: “It’s OK. They’re not really dead.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c4dd6117ac1696e861540803d437b89f050243b/336_0_2996_1799/master/2996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd7d4dd5a5f7456e932079a89cc521bd","title":"spooks watch along series one episode three steely keeley hawes to the fore","story":"A hostage situation at the Turkish embassy offers a chance for Zoe to shine in this week’s instalmentHello everyone and welcome back.

Well, apart from various Christmas and New Year specials in 1999, 2004, 2005, 2007...That’s a line isn’t it? Who was it who used to say that? Trevor Peacock’s character, Jim Trott.But it really is coming back?

Interestin? Not a fan of the letter G, then? That’s just how they speak in the countryside. Well, the Reverend Geraldine Granger did anyway.And #BigNightIn? This week’s three-hour Comic Relief and Children in Need telethon, featuring Zoe Ball, Davina McCall, Lenny Henry, Paddy McGuinness, Peter Kay and many more. It will raise money for and celebrate those going the extra mile to support their communities during the Covid-19 crisis.Any clues as to what we might see from Geraldine? Viewers of The One Show were treated to a sneaky preview, in which the vicar was self-isolating in corona lockdown. “I had the first meeting of the Dibley parish council conducted by an app called Zoom,” she says. “It was the best parish council meeting I’ve ever had, largely because none of the other councillors know how to get on to Zoom.”So up-to-the-minute in current affairs and tech, possibly less so when it comes to comedy trends. Hardly Fleabag, is it? Or The End of the F***ing World? Hey, don’t be like that. The Vicar of Dibley was not just incredibly popular, it shone a light on casual everyday sexism soon after the changes that permitted the ordination of women.

The city state’s prime minister announced a lockdown would be extended by four weeks until 1 June.More than 170,000 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic so far, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There have been more than 2.47m cases worldwide. Just under a quarter of global deaths – 42,000 – have been in the US. The UK has nearly 126,000 cases and more than 16,500 deaths.US president Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he will “temporarily suspend” immigration to the US, referring to the “invisible enemy”,​ a term he has used in the White House press briefings and on Twitter to refer to coronavirus.The World Health Organization said ​ all available evidence suggested ​ the coronavirus originated in bats in China late in 2019 and was not manipulated or constructed in a laboratory. Trump said last week the US was trying to determine whether the virus emanated from a lab in Wuhan in central China.The country’s prime minister said the government would unveil plans for the gradual reopening from lockdown before the end of this week. Italy reported 454 new deaths from coronavirus on Monday, 21 more than on Sunday, bringing the death toll to 24,114. For the first time, the number of people who are infected fell by 20 to 108,237.The country’s government has announced it will not allow gatherings of more than 500 people until at least 1 September, and that the current ban on gatherings of more than 10 people will stay in place until 10 May. Denmark was one of the first European countries to introduce lockdown restrictions on 12 March, before it had ​recorded any deaths. ​Three hundred and 64 people are now reported to have died in the country.Bavaria’s leaders have cancelled Oktoberfest, the world’s biggest beer festival, due to fears that it could become a breeding ground for the coronavirus. The 210-year-old festival, which attracts six million visitors and brings in around €1bn a year, is a major event in the German calendar.The US oil market collapsed into negative prices for the first time as North America’s oil producers run out of space to store an unprecedented oversupply of crude left by the pandemic.

Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock – like Covid-19 – to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe.”Global hunger could become the next big impact of the pandemic, warns the Global Report on Food Crises, by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the World Food Programme and 14 other organisations, published on Tuesday. Some of the poorest countries may face the choice of trying to save people stricken by the virus only for them to fall prey to hunger.António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said the report must be a call to action.“The upheaval that has been set in motion by the Covid-19 pandemic may push even more families and communities into deeper distress,” he wrote in the foreword.“At this time of immense global challenges, from conflicts to climate shocks to economic instability, we must redouble our efforts to defeat hunger and malnutrition. We have the tools and the knowhow. What we need is political will and sustained commitment by leaders and nations.”The report, which will be presented to the UN security council on Tuesday afternoon, bolsters warnings that the world could face a repeat of the 2007-08 food price rises that sparked widespread political upheaval, the impacts of which are still being felt across the Middle East and from Asia to Latin America.Food experts are worried that donor nations have barely begun to deliver the funding needed urgently on the ground to set up networks to deliver humanitarian relief to the worst-hit areas, deliveries which need to be achieved by air as ground transport is obstructed or halted over large areas.The World Food Programme estimates that $350m (£280m) will be needed immediately, but only about a quarter of the sum has yet been forthcoming.The pandemic was first felt in some of the world’s biggest economies, originating in China, then hitting Italy and Spain, and now the US has become the centre. There is less data available on the spread in developing countries, where widespread testing is not being done and healthcare systems are often lacking.The report finds that already stretched health services in developing countries are likely to be overwhelmed, while a global recession will disrupt food supply chains. There are particular concerns for people working in the informal economy, and the world’s 79 million refugees and displaced people.Labour shortages as people fall ill may put further strain on food production, protectionist measures may increase food prices, and rising unemployment will reduce people’s purchasing power, driving more into hunger.On the plus side, harvest prospects for staple crops are good, but the movement restrictions to contain the spread of the virus will create problems for food distribution.Poorer countries are bracing for the full impact of Covid-19 on their health systems, and are already seeing the effects of the economic shutdown that has sent the world spiralling into recession.Some of the poorest nations “may face an excruciating trade-off between saving lives or livelihoods or, in a worst-case scenario, saving people from the coronavirus to have them die from hunger”, the report warned.Even without the impact of coronavirus, the outlook for many countries – such as Yemen, where conflict has led to millions facing starvation, and in east Africa, where locusts are posing a famine threat – was already dire.Despite good recent harvests in many parts of the world, the extra stress of the pandemic will take many other nations riven by conflict or political unrest beyond breaking point. Extreme weather driven by climate breakdown is also likely to add to the toll, as it did last year.Last year, of the 130 million people suffering acute food insecurity, the majority (77 million) were in countries afflicted by conflict, 34 million were hit by the climate crisis, and 24 million were in areas where there was an economic crisis.Charities and civil society groups are also calling on rich countries’ governments to take action to help the poorest at risk of starvation.Catholic Relief Services in the US is campaigning for the US Congress to devote new funds to the fight urgently.“The pandemic is a crisis on top of a crisis in parts of Africa, Latin America and Asia,” said Sean Callahan, chief executive of the charity.“The severe health risks are only part of the outbreak. Lockdowns are hampering people from planting and harvesting crops, working as day labourers and selling products, among other problems. That means less income for desperately hungry people to buy food and less food available, at higher prices.”Multinational food companies also recently warned that the number of people in chronic hunger could double to more than 1.6 billion as a result of the pandemic, and urged world leaders to take action. Nobel prize-winning economists have warned that developed nations will increase the threat of damaging recurrences of the virus in their own countries if they fail to fund measures in the poor world.However, there are signs that international cooperation on the pandemic is under strain. The US refused to sign up to an extensive draft communique by G20 health ministers that bolstered the role of the World Health Organization, preferring a brief version that acknowledged gaps in the world’s preparedness, and president Donald Trump has halted US funding for the WHO."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebdcc1051d8a451771c2fafffbd2e316546cfe2a/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a88411c6f30263b25ec7b5af02c994b5","title":"ice free arctic summers now very likely even with climate action","story":"Scientists surprised by latest results but say carbon cuts remain vital to prevent ice loss becoming permanentThe loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic is now very likely before 2050, new research shows, even if the carbon emissions driving the climate crisis are cut rapidly.The result has alarmed scientists but they said slashing greenhouse gases remained vital as this would determine whether Arctic summer ice vanished permanently or could recover over time. If emissions remain very high, there is a risk the Arctic could be ice-free even in the dark, cold winter months, a possibility described as “catastrophic”.The last global scientific assessment of Arctic ice was in 2013. It predicted a complete loss of ice in the month of September, when it reaches its annual minimum, would occur only if CO2 emissions from human activities remained high. The new results are based on 40 of the latest computer models and is the best assessment to date of the fate of the Arctic ice.The loss of the ice exposes the dark ocean, which absorbs more of the sun’s heat and further ramps up temperatures. These changes are also being increasingly linked to more extreme weather including severe winters, deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods at lower latitudes such as in Europe and the US.“Alarmingly the models repeatedly show the potential for ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean before 2050, almost irrespective of the measures taken to mitigate the effects of climate change,” said Ed Blockley, who leads the UK Met Office’s polar climate programme and was one of the team behind the new research. “The signal is there in all possible futures. This was unexpected and is extremely worrying.”Prof Dirk Notz, at the University of Hamburg, Germany, coordinated the analysis and said: “If we keep global warming below 2C, Arctic sea ice will nevertheless likely disappear occasionally in summer even before 2050. This really surprised us.”“This is the state-of-the-art in terms of sea ice simulations,” said Till Wagner, of the University of North Carolina Wilmington, US, and not involved in the new study.The models are not perfect and struggle to match closely the ice loss and global warming seen in historical data. “There is still a lot of uncertainty,” Blockley said. “But all the models are clear that the sea ice will continue to decline. At some point, it will be gone, but when that happens is still uncertain.”Wagner said the loss of Arctic sea ice could have far-reaching consequences, from increasing global heating to harming wildlife: “It also opens up a new ocean for human exploration, from oil and gas extraction, to increased shipping, to increased tourism, each with their own perils and benefits.”Prof James Screen, at the University of Exeter, UK, said: “It is important to keep in mind that although we might see an ice-free Arctic in all scenarios by 2050, the expected frequency of ice-free summers differs between scenarios. Under a higher emissions scenarios there may be ice-free summers every year, but in lower emissions scenarios they might be occasional.”Blockley said the new research showed cutting carbon emissions remained vital to prevent the worst impacts on the Arctic, adding: “We are showing there is still hope.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b281086afc40c51e159964b30eabec3b1aa933/0_244_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42ecce41931368958277cb6b52fa6e81","title":"latin america coronavirus lockdowns low income","story":"Families struggle to maintain coronavirus restrictions as they seek to stay afloat: ‘My fear is my children going hungry’by  Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro,  Uki Goñi in Buenos Aires, Cindy Jiménez Becerra in La Paz, Lexi Parra in Caracas,  Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogotá, and  David Agren in Mexico CityLeaders across Latin America have ordered their citizens indoors as they struggle to tame the coronavirus.But for Liliana Pérez, an Argentinian single mother of six, staying at home is a pipe dream.“My fear isn’t becoming infected. My fear is my children going hungry,” said Pérez, a 43-year-old volunteer from Villa Soldati, a pocket of extreme poverty in Buenos Aires, who is delivering hot meals to older people out of a baby’s pram.But each day Marcos de Oliveira rises before dawn in the Vila Aliança community and heads out to keep his household afloat.“It’s not just any old cold. It’s an illness we still don’t properly understand and I can see it’s getting worse in Brazil,” Oliveira, a 45-year-old metalworker, said of Covid-19, which has now claimed nearly 2,500 Brazilian lives.“But unfortunately people have to work – we’ve got to make a living.”Across Latin America and the Caribbean – where an estimated 113 million people live in low-income barrios, favelas or villas – families are struggling to adapt to coronavirus lockdowns or social isolation orders because of more immediate financial imperatives.“People are more worried about being able to feed their families than they are about the coronavirus,” said Pérez, one of more than three million people who live in Argentina’s densely populated villas.In recent days, as some governments have announced aid packages to help their poorest citizens stay home, there have been reports of containment measures fraying in places such as Venezuela’s Petare and Brazil’s Rocinha, two of Latin America’s largest communities.César Sanabria, an organizer in Buenos Aires’ Villa 31 community, said the situation there was similar and cited cramped living conditions as one explanation.“We’re trying to keep safe but it’s very difficult when a whole familylives in only 16 square metres,” said Sanabria, who runs a radio station in the 45,000-strong settlement beside Buenos Aires’ exclusive Recoleta neighbourhood.“We’re not really isolating,” he admitted. “You still see a lot of people on the streets.”Lockdown does seem to be working in some areas – albeit with dramatic consequences for already struggling residents.In Colombia’s capital, Bogotá, residents of deprived neighbourhoods have tied red rags to their windows to signal that those inside are going hungry. Riot police last week clashed with residents in Ciudad Bolívar, a sprawling mountainside neighbourhood, who were demanding food supplies promised by the president, Iván Duque.“I’ve got no money and nothing to eat,” complained María Ticona, 44, a mother of five from Villa Copacabana, a deprived corner of El Alto, a high-altitude city above Bolivia’s de facto capital, La Paz.Before the lockdown – which is being strictly enforced by Bolivian troops – Ticona sold bread and scraped together perhaps $4 a day. That income has evaporated. “My kids haven’t eaten properly since the quarantine began,” she complained.Nancy Ramos, a 44-year-old resident of El Valle, a working-class community in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, said the streets around her home were largely quiet – even if part of the credit lay with local gangsters waging a turf war in a time of coronavirus.“By 7pm, the neighborhood looks like a cemetery. There’s nobody around,” said Ramos, a carpark manager who was still having to work.“I’d say the first two weeks, people were stressed out about the quarantine – nervous of getting the virus,” she added. “Now, we have a new shock: staying safe while the little gang boys run around.”Tepito – a hardscrabble barrio in central Mexico City that houses a bustling street market – is also subdued. “Eighty per cent of businesses are closed,” said Mario Puga, a local historian and activist.Residents of Rio’s 1,000-odd favelas say they are finding hibernating harder.“When I got home tonight there were loads of people in the street chatting. Kids playing hide and seek and football,” said Oliveira. “It’s alarming.”Social isolation also appeared to be sagging in nearby neighbourhoods, albeit for different reasons. “This morning when I was on my way to work … the bus passed a petrol station and it was packed... cars all over the place, lots of people there boozing. It was like they were throwing a rave in the petrol station,” Oliveira joked.Ivan França Jr, an epidemiologist from the University of São Paulo’s faculty of public health, said that for isolation orders to work they had to be accompanied by economic aid.“Social distancing can’t just be: ‘Don’t leave your homes,’” he said. “This is a very elitist and middle-class mindset.”Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was born into privation and won acclaim for his poverty relief work, said governments needed to do more to help the poor cope. “People will stay at home if they’re given the means to stay at home,” Lula told the .Regional governments say they are moving to offer such support.More than 45 million Brazilians will reportedly receive an emergency stipend of 600 reais (£91, $113) – although the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has warned such support cannot go on “eternally”.But there and across the region, some of Latin America’s neediest citizens say that is too little, too late.Before coronavirus, María Angélica García, a 40-year-old from El Altowith Parkinson’s disease, fed her five children and bought her medicines by begging at the Ceja street market with a cardboard sign.With the Bolivian bazaar now deserted and locals stranded at home she was penniless and hungry.“I hope this coronavirus situation sorts itself out,” García said. “I can’t believe what has happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd0bb24933ce48d7b843a383c57e064dfa558703/0_320_4943_2966/master/4943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af7443f80f82ebbb963877e55ef1b5b3","title":"new york subway mta workers coronavirus","story":"Although riders have disappeared due to coronavirus, 68 transit workers have died – and many are upset the MTA did not move faster to protect themNew York’s transit system is in crisis.

And for the 50,000-plus people employed by the politan Transportation Authority (MTA), just turning up for work has become a matter of life or death.So far about 2,400 transit workers have tested positive for the coronavirus while 4,000 are quarantined. Sixty-eight workers have died.Many are angry at the way – especially in the early days – that the US’s largest transport system responded to the crisis. “They want to call us heroes now, but how can you call us heroes when you didn’t give your heroes the proper equipment to fight this?” said Tramell Thompson, a New York City train conductor.With workers off sick and trains and buses canceled, platforms are sometimes still crowded and trains packed even though ridership has plummeted. The transit system now faces an $8.5bn funding crisis.Some are angry that the MTA did not move more quickly to protect them. On 4 March, according to documents seen by the , a note from an MTA official to transit staff instructed them not to wear masks “since a mask is not part of the authorized uniform and not medically recommended at this time they may not be worn by uniformed MTA employees”.On 6 March, another memo advised supervisors to tell transit workers wearing masks that they should not wear them during working hours.Both notes said this order would change if the guidance changed – as it did – but for some MTA workers it was too little too late.Thompson, a train operator for six years, tested positive for coronavirus on 13 April after quarantining from work. He first started experiencing symptoms when his asthma medication stopped working, and wasn’t tested until his symptoms worsened to fever, diarrhea and loss of appetite. “This job got me sick. No one else in my family is sick. I’m not going back to the job for it to kill me,” said Thompson. “I’m not going back to work until I’m able to breathe without any help.”Michael Brantley, 36, another MTA train operator, spent three nights in the hospital earlier this month after testing positive for coronavirus. “I undoubtedly believe I got it from work,” said Brantley. “The MTA did not handle this well.”“They have no problem playing Russian roulette with our lives,” said John Ferretti, a MTA subway operator and Transport Workers Union shop steward.Transit workers also accused the MTA of not rolling out safety protocols quickly enough to protect workers and the public earlier from exposure to the coronavirus. The MTA was following state and federal guidelines. It wasn’t until 15 April that New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, told people to wear masks or face coverings in public whenever social distancing was not possible.But MTA workers argue the transportation authority should have known what was coming. “They didn’t start taking personal protective equipment seriously until March 30. The first transit worker died on March 27. They waited until multiple workers died to start taking it seriously. We were sacrificial lambs,” said Canella Gomez, an MTA subway operator for eight years.Gomez claimed a supervisor told him last month to talk to his union in response to requests to improve social distancing at the Bedford Park subway terminal in the Bronx. He also criticized the MTA for only providing temperature checks to supervisors in the subway ision.“It’s a slap in the face to every member of my department who is not sick, still coming to work to try to make their broken system work,” added Gomez.Seth Rosenberg, a MTA subway operator, also noted he was told by a supervisor to talk to his union over concerns he expressed on 17 March about operating equipment not being sanitized and clean every round trip in between different co-workers using it.“They told me it was my responsibility, not the MTA’s responsibility, and if I had safety concerns I should talk to the union,” said Rosenberg. “Our labor has been considered essential. Our health has been considered negotiable and our lives are considered expendable.”Ray Reigadas, a MTA train operator, recently returned to work after being quarantined with coronavirus symptoms. He claimed the personal protective equipment (PPE) now being distributed to workers is rationed and limited.“They are now giving out PPE, but you have to ask the dispatcher for it. You think they would hand it to you when you walk in. They give you one mask, two wipes and say that has to last you the week,” he said.A spokesperson for MTA declined to comment on inidual complaints, but noted the agency has followed guidelines and advice from federal and state agencies throughout the pandemic and that transport officials too were frustrated by the lack of support they had received from the federal government.“We feel incredibly let down by the fact the federal authorities were specifically telling us not to distribute medical and personal protective equipment. I think it’s been frustrating for folks in my position and other positions that this guidance keeps shifting and it’s really hard to nail the federal government down on what the right response to any of this is,” said Feinberg.Last week the MTA announced it would pay $500,000 each to the families of coronavirus victims, even if the MTA can not decisively trace the source of a worker’s infection to their job.“What our frontline workers have done during this pandemic is nothing short of heroic and we believe this agreement is another crucial step in recognizing their sacrifice,” said Pat Foye, MTA chairman and chief executive, in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b09e19ae4b0d97b97a5b019f586ad7d4787a1f02/0_354_4886_2932/master/4886.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fe571e4bb06b1dfbc39a9a2d7fd5894","title":"non running of the bulls san fermin festival suspended over covid 19","story":"Tomatina food fight also in jeopardy as physical distancing hits Spain’s tourism industryThe festival of San Fermín, which for centuries has unleashed half-tonne fighting bulls into the narrow streets of Pamplona, has been suspended indefinitely as Spain battles one of the world’s deadliest outbreaks of Covid-19.“As expected as it was, it still leaves us deeply sad,” said Ana Elizalde, the acting mayor of Pamplona. “As of today, it seems unlikely that the festival will be celebrated this year, but let’s wait and see how the events evolve.”Spain has recorded more than 21,000 deaths from coronavirus and more than 200,000 confirmed cases of infection. In the northern region of Navarra, which includes Pamplona, more than 350 people have been killed by the virus.“In this context, there’s no place for fireworks, bullfights or bull runs,” said Elizalde.The fiesta, long a target for animal rights activists, has been called off only a handful of times in the past century, for reasons such as civil war or other political unrest. It typically draws around a million visitors for nine days of alcohol-fuelled partying.“It seems our beloved fiesta is at odds with the coronavirus,” Elizalde said. “We’re supposed to wear masks, keep a social distance – measures that are incompatible with what San Fermín is.”In the small town of Buñol, near Valencia, the mayor and town councillors will meet on Monday to debate what lies ahead for the world’s largest food fight. Held each year in August, the Tomatina usually crams 20,000 people into the town to pelt each other with thousands of ripe tomatoes.In the heart of the Rioja wine region – where the coronavirus outbreak has taken a particularly deadly toll – June usually heralds Haro’s wine battle, in which participants drench each other in 70,000 litres of red wine.The rapidly changing situation in Spain has left little room for concrete estimates on when tourism might return to normal. “Our country will not start tourist activity until it is extraordinarily safe, both for those who live in Spain and who come to visit,” the government spokesperson María Jesús Montero said last week.The government imposed strict lockdown measures in mid-March, and closed land borders to all but Spanish citizens and residents soon after.The labour minister, Yolanda Díaz, recently suggested the tourism, culture and leisure sectors would not restart until after the summer and could expect to face “enormous difficulty”.The tourism minister, Reyes Maroto, hinted that jam-packed festivals, beaches and plazas would not be seen anytime soon. “Until there is a vaccine, nothing will be the way it was before. Gatherings will have to be limited to maintain safe distances,” she told the newspaper El País.“It is very important that we continue to follow health recommendations,” she added. “We have to keep up what we are doing now washing our hands, keeping social distance … even on the beach.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7561d22120ac6f4d4d0b2b1c2385bd251366ed82/0_22_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a68c7ac3e82b5e668079b5539f27e912","title":"pub crawls and drive by revelry how uk is celebrating birthdays in lockdown","story":"Student housemates in Manchester transformed eight rooms into themed pubs for 21stThe coronavirus lockdown has wrecked holiday plans and put social lives on hold. But while the parties may have been postponed, birthday celebrations have continued in earnest and people across the UK have forged unforgettable memories.Still, there have been sacrifices. Even for the Queen, who cancelled her customary birthday gun salutes on Tuesday, her 94th birthday, for what is thought to be the first time in her reign, as “she did not feel it appropriate in the current circumstances”. In Manchester, Elsie Wilson and her two housemates transformed all eight rooms of their student house into a different pub, each with an inidual theme, for her 21st birthday.“My housemates and I were thinking about the things we’d like to do when lockdown was over, and we wanted a pub crawl, so we made one at home,” she said. “We were originally supposed to have my birthday in a pub, so we decided to recreate it in the house.”They put up pub signs on doors and changed clothing before going into each room, which each featured a designated cocktail.“The bathroom was ‘dress to the nines’, the garden was ‘British summertime’, the kitchen was 70s, and the living room was pyjamas. And in each bedroom, you had to dress like the person whose room it was,” Wilson said.In south-west London, Stephen Kelly turned 48 on 31 March – two weeks after spending a week in hospital with coronavirus. On his birthday morning he enjoyed a lie-in at home before he opened the blinds and to his surprise found an enormous “happy birthday” banner across his back garden, prompting his neighbours to wish him well.“My son and his mother, who is an art teacher, told me not to get up, and I thought they were making a cake or something,” he said. “They were very crafty about it.”In the town of Bromsgrove, in Worcestershire, police officer Nicola Moore had planned to have a party at a nearby bar for her 40th birthday but instead camped in her garden with her partner and her daughter before friends dropped off presents in her driveway.“I was extremely grateful to have a few friends, on their daily essential travel, take time to pass by to wish me a happy birthday and leave gifts,” she said.“I didn’t want people coming round, but it was out of my control. For them it was like taking exercise and you’re having your present whether you like it or not.”In Walton-upon-Thames, Surrey, 80-year-old Anna Clements spent her birthday picking vegetables on her allotment to serve as crudites for her fellow almshouse residents at a gathering on Tuesday evening.Originally, she had planned to spend a long weekend away in the Derbyshire countryside with her family before the distancing rules came in. Clements had then looked forward to securing a “click and collect” spot at the local Tesco for her birthday, but thought better of leaving her retirement village due to the risk of contracting coronavirus.“It was going to be spent rather grimly at Tesco’s but not anymore, it’s too risky” she said. “I’ll be drinking lots of cider and everyone else will be drinking wine. We are very careful, though. Everyone is terrific about keeping distances.”Back in the capital, 11-year-old child actor Naya Luena had four consecutive house party calls on her birthday last week – with her classmates, fellow actors in a West End production of Lion King, one with family around the world and one with her closest friends.“It wasn’t a bad birthday,” she said. “It was something to get used to, but it was still really fun because there were lots of things you usually wouldn’t do on your birthday.”The candles were blown out on the cake away from the video calls, however, in order to not make anyone jealous. “That’s one of the advantages of the lockdown, that you don’t have to share the cake with others.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993ba967d939b7d914df131645216384a105f88e/0_0_5780_3466/master/5780.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=7ea1a4eaad579f5ceb11c818fdd7acc4","title":"my shrunken world lockdown in camden in pictures","story":"Challenging herself to see her immediate environment in a new way, photographer Sarah Lee, who has been on complete lockdown for over four weeks, shot these images on an iPhone within a one-mile radius of her home in Camden Town, north London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cbf6b18d92dd7d199bc4f500bba72750d8c716b/0_257_5690_3416/master/5690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc1ddfbd92d0bc95e80656bee62e2554","title":"uk coronavirus live parliament returns government lockdown latest updates","story":"UK hospital deaths up by 823 to 17,337 MPs vote for virtual parliament sessions Boris Johnson speaks to TrumpQ: How worried are you about asymptomatic transmission? Should asymptomatic health staff be tested?Hancock says this is a good question. The existence of asymptomatic transmission is a particular problem with coronavirus, he says.Van-Tam says at the start of the crisis the officials did not have enough information about whether pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were shedding the virus.Now they know this can happen, he says.But he says they still do not know how symptomatic they are compared to people with symptoms.He says it is impossible to rule out spread occurring from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people.But most of the spread is from people who do display symptoms, he says.Q: There have been reports the China has run a global disinformation campaign to deflect the blame for its own responsibility for this. What is your response?Hancock says he has not seen that report. But he thinks there has been disinformation. He says it is vital that people are provided with accurate information about what has been happening.Hancock says some of the firms offering to supply PPE to the government have not been credible. Some have only just been formed, he says.He says, in trying to procure it worldwide, the government has tried to go direct to the source. It is more secure if you deal directly with the factory, he says.Van-Tam says Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, has met today to discuss face mask policy. In time a recommendation will go to ministers, and they will make a decision.But the government will not do anything that might jeopardise the supply of PPE to medical staff, he says.Q: Why did the most senior figure at the Foreign Office say it was a political decision not to join the EU’s ventilator procurement scheme, when the government claimed it was a communications mix-up?Hancock says he has not seen what Sir Simon McDonald said. (See 4.17pm.) But he says he has spoken to Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary. Raab told him there was no political decision not to participate.But no PPE has been delivered through that scheme, he says.(Hancock seems to be confusing the EU ventilator procurement scheme with a separate EU PPE procurement one.)Van-Tam is now presenting the daily slides.Van-Tam says this next one is particularly important.He says hospital cases in London did peak, probably on 10 April. Since then they have gone down. But in other regions it has been more of a plateau, he says.This slide is a new addition. It shows the gap between hospital coronavirus deaths and all coronavirus deaths.And here is the final slide, with global comparisons.Hancock turns to vaccines.He says the UK will throw everything it has at trying to find one.Two of the leading efforts around the world are taking place in the UK, he says.He says today he is making £22m available to Imperial to support their phase two trials.And he is making £20m available to the Oxford team to accelerate their trials. The vaccine from the Oxford project will be trialled on people from Thursday.Normally it would take years to get to this point, he says.And he says the government is investing in manufacturing capability so, if it works, it can be produced in scale.He says nothing about this is inevitable. Vaccine production is a matter of trial and error, he says.He says the benefits of getting a vaccine are so huge “that I am throwing everything at it”.Hancock turns to PPE.He says since the crisis started one billion items of PPE have been delivered.He thanks firms that have offered to supply PPE.He says some firms who have approached the government have been unable to provide equipment on scale.But he says the government is now working with 159 potential UK suppliers.The government is determined to get the equipment it needs, he says. He says it has been a huge procurement effort.Hancock says the government will not relax the lockdown until certain conditions are met. Above all, there must be no second peak, he says.Hancock says the government’s priority has been to stop the NHS being overwhelmed. That has happened. At no point has the NHS been unable to treat a patient needing treatment, he says.He reads out the latest death and testing figures.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is holding the government’s daily press conference. He is appearing with Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, and Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England.A health board has pledged to look into the availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at its hospitals after staff appealed for help sourcing supplies, writes my colleague Ben Quinn. A post on a Facebook group, which has been widely shared, carried an image of a mask described as an Easimask Duckbill, and claimed that University Hospital of Wales (UHW) no longer had stocks. We have ran out on ICU in UHW, meaning a lot of staff myself included aren’t able to provide care for COVID patients. If you do have any of these masks please get in touch.Contacted about the claims, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said in a statement that it was aware of concerns raised by some staff in the media regarding the availability and or inaccessibility of PPE.It added: As a Health Board the safety of our staff is of the greatest importance alongside that of our patients. As a result of the inferences made we are taking a more detailed look into the availability of PPE across our sites and we regularly check our systems to ensure that we get stock to the right place at the right time.It said that it had enough PPE equipment available and in stock, if the right level of PPE was used in the right circumstances. If a colleague has not found this to be the case and they have encountered either a shortage or a perceived shortage we would encourage them to raise it immediately, there’s a freedom to speak up hotline that staff can use.As the mystery of the missing consignment of PPE from Turkey continues, the ’s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh writes that supplies are edging closer to the plane that will transport them back to the UK:At last, some of the PPE bought by the NHS from Turkey is clearing customs at Istanbul airport, defence sources report. It’s not clear long it will take to get the single waiting RAF A400M transport plane, or whether it includes of all the 400,000 protective gowns badly needed by the NHS. But after days of delay and broken promises it is possible some PPE will be brought back from Turkey overnight.Another nine people have died with Covid-19 in Northern Ireland in the last 24 hours, Stormont deputy fist minister Michelle O’Neill said. She said the projected worst case scenario of 1,500 deaths in the first 20 weeks was still “shocking and harrowing” but that had been significantly reduced.“The reduction is because of you and your actions have saved thousands of lives,” she said.First Minister Arlene Foster said the ministerial executive at Stormont would have more discussions about whether to reopen cemeteries during the coronavirus lockdown. She said visiting could be allowed over limited hours and making sure social distancing was in place, admitting other colleagues had “justifiable concerns”.Downing Street has just released the read-out of the telephone call that Boris Johnson had with President Trump earlier. Here it is in full. A No 10 spokesperson said:The prime minister spoke to President Trump this afternoon, and thanked him for his good wishes while he was unwell.The leaders agreed on the importance of a coordinated international response to coronavirus, including through the G7 – which the US currently chairs.They also discussed continued UK-US cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.The leaders committed to continue working together to strengthen our bilateral relationship, including by signing a free trade agreement as soon as possible.At the lunchtime Downing Street briefing the prime minister’s spokesman claimed that Johnson was still recuperating and that he was not “formally doing government work”. This is now sounding more and more like the sort of lie many of us tell our GPs (“definitely no more than 20 units a week, doctor”). If discussing a global crisis with the president of the US does not count as government work, it is hard to know what does."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227786.1586863429!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"home school how to turn a cramped home into a learning friendly space","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichelle Gerson, an interior designer, planned three separate zones for her eight-year-old son’s studies, including a built-in desk in his bedroom with storage shelves and drawers. Like many people’s homes at the moment, mine now resembles a juvenile corporate office. My six-year-old logs into Zoom for morning meetings and singalongs, my eight-year-old uses Google Docs to pitch fairy-tale adaptations to his teacher, and both use new email accounts to compare schedules with classmates and dole out emojis.When schools closed, my wife and I scrambled to gather the digital gear and download the multitude of apps that enable online learning. But like so many parents suddenly required to work from home, we devoted an equal amount of time to fretting about how we could all complete our tasks in such close quarters, without ending up in a daily battle royale.Fortunately, our eight-year-old’s teacher, Jennifer Frish, had some ideas for keeping the peace. The day before online classes began, she encouraged parents to set up a dedicated learning space for their children. For strategies on how to do that successfully, I asked educators and interior designers for advice.Give them their own spacePulling a stool up to the kitchen island, which might have worked for casual homework, isn’t going to cut it when your child will be studying all day, every day, for weeks or months. Adding a small desk, if you have the space, is one easy option for creating a dedicated space.But it is not the only solution. One end of a dining table can work just as well, Frish says, as long as the space is clearly demarcated and reserved for the child’s use. “You could block it off with masking tape,” she says. “Or get a cardboard ider.” In the classroom, Frish has privacy partitions from Lakeshore Learning Materials available for students who need help focusing, but you could just as easily make one from a cardboard box, she says. Especially now that you’re having so many purchases delivered.If your child already has a desk, it is probably covered with everything but tools for learning, says interior designer Ghislaine Vinas, in which case it needs a refresh. “If your kid is lucky enough to have a desk in the apartment, take everything off that desk, give it a good clean and start over,” Vinas says.Design with your childrenYour child’s desk is not the place to showcase your personal design ambitions. More than anything else, Frish stressed the importance of including your child in the design process.“It’s extremely important not only to set up a space, but to have them plan it out with you,” she says. “It gives them ownership and, later on, more accountability.” The goal, she added, is to end up with a workspace where they will love spending time. One way Vinas has helped her children, who are now teenagers, create personalised workspaces over the years is by encouraging them to make collages.“Take images from Instagram or whatever else inspires them. Print them, cut them out and create beautiful collages of things that are meaningful to them,” she says. “They can look at those things, dream and stay inspired.”Provide tools for organisationHaving storage space for school supplies is critical to supporting learning and maintaining sanity.“Sharpen all the pencils, have extra paper and make sure you have a place where everything goes back to,” says Julie Bogart, author of The Brave Learner: Finding Everyday Magic in Homeschool, Learning, and Life and founder of online learning company Brave Writer, who home-schooled her five children.In her house, the children would return all their learning materials to inidual cubbies at the end of each day, she says, so they were always ready to go the next morning. “One of the big jokes in the home-schooling market is, ‘I don’t know where the maths book is,’” she noted, “because so often kids lose it somewhere, or hide it.”Baskets, bins and cups can help keep various types of materials separated while containing the clutter. They don’t have to be fancy. Shoeboxes and plastic containers can be repurposed as holders of notebooks and markers, and Vinas recommended painting soup cans to make pencil cups.To keep those containers organised – and off the floor and desktop – consider adding shelves near the desk, says Joan Enger, founder of J Patryce Design \u0026amp Company.For one teen’s study, Enger installed a bookcase for storing baskets of different sizes, along with books and magazine files. And for her son, she added a wall-mounted shelf directly above his desk. “He has dual monitors and all this computer stuff on his desk,” she says. “So we just put an Ikea shelf right above the desk,” to catch everything else.Offer various options for seatingAt school, children often have a wide variety of seating options. When it’s reading time in Frish’s class, some students sit at group tables, some use benches, some opt for sitting on the rug with a pillow and one lucky child might snag the beanbag chair.“The biggest thing is that we want kids to feel comfortable in their workspace,” she says. Trying to get a child to sit on a hard desk chair for six to eight hours a day is a fool’s errand, so offer at least a couple of choices – a desk chair, for example, along with floor pillows.If you have the space, you could set up multiple workstations for different tasks, says Michelle Gerson, an interior designer.Add headphones and a task lampIn the same way that you probably don’t appreciate a kindergartner’s singalong while taking an important business call, children likely don’t want to hear your Zoom presentation while trying to tackle long ision. Headphones can help, Frish says, by shutting out background noise.A task lamp is also important, Enger says. “Overhead lighting is not really conducive to studying, especially if you’re doing writing or reading,” she says. “A task lamp offers more direct lighting.” She recommended looking for a simple, inexpensive LED-based model that takes up a minimum of desk space.Be flexibleTry to remember that no matter how much you work on the design of a child’s study space, it is no classroom. “School is designed as an institution with desks, classrooms, blackboards and teachers in the front of the room to create an environment that helps children cooperate with the agenda,” Bogart says. “Home is not like that. Home is where we come to get relief from that, where we don’t have to perform and where we relax.”Trying to create a strict, school-like environment at home “is like oil and water – and your kids know it”, she says. “They don’t cooperate the way they do for the teacher.” So when things start going off the rails, the best response may be to take a deep breath and embrace the idea that learning can happen just about anywhere.“Some children are much more likely to do their handwriting practice if you give it to them on a clipboard, set them up in the corner of the sectional, tuck them in with a blanket and let them pet the cat,” Bogart says. “In other words, we’re borrowing from the ine wonder of home,” she adds. “It’s about balancing the yin and the yang.” – New York Times serviceEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227752.1586784529!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"my kids have too much homework and i m struggling to cope what can i do","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt’s very stressful trying to juggle my job with supervising homeschooling.

To make matters worse, teachers are giving my kids too much homework to do. Can I ask my school to go easy on them? These are anxious and uncertain times for everybody. Getting your own work done, keeping spirits up, and managing the expectations of both schools and your own children can appear to be an overwhelming task. It may seem that others don’t understand what you are facing in your own space, as indeed each family set-up is different.The old adage certainly applies here: start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. If you feel under unreasonable pressure, you need to let people know that, and explain to them what you are trying to do.OverwhelmedWith the best of intentions, all of the resources that are being shared – website links, apps, games, books – can add to the sense of feeling overwhelmed. Where do you start? And if you hear on the grapevine that the school down the road is doing all of this, where does that leave your children?One thing you can be sure of is some of the questions you have have been answered by parents or teachers or students somewhere else.For teachers or parents who have time, the Teaching Council and the Professional Development Service for Teachers has launched a webinar series – Learning For All – to share the best of what is happening out there.It also offers guidance and support for the real challenges faced by school communities as they seek to support learning over distance. In effect, this series is creating a space for everybody to connect to share learning.In the meantime, remember that we will come through this. The schools will re-open. It is really important that we all support and sustain ourselves as people, day by day, so that we can be ready to embrace the opportunities for further learning that will emerge at that point.As John O’Donohue reminds us – “where you are understood, you are at home”. Take this time to try to enjoy being at home, to come to a deeper understanding of all that matters. Learning and knowledge come in many different forms, and we have been given an opportunity to learn about how we learn, as iniduals and as a society.

Photograph: Angela Ponce  BloombergWhen the Green Jersey awards are being handed out for service during the national pandemic there is sure to be one with the name of Dr Paul O’Brien on it.A China-based doctor and regulatory expert, Dr O’Brien could be said to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time when the Covid-19 outbreak started in that country at the beginning of the year. However, the 35-year-old Corkman proved to be the right man in the right place for Ireland when the disease started heading to Europe and he realised he could play a major role in our efforts to deal with the crisis. He first came to public attention when he wrote an open letter online to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and HSE boss Paul Reid in early March critiquing aspects of the national response to the pandemic. Based on his conversations with Chinese medics, he believed – correctly – that Europe was at the time sleepwalking itself into a crisis.“I was very worried because I had been in touch with Chinese docs and they said we seemed not to know what we’re in for.”But whereas others might have preferred to hurl on the ditch, O’Brien, eschewing an overtly political approach, has been of enormous practical assistance in sourcing help from China to bring to bear on the emerging crisis back at home.When the disease was still confined to China, he had been involved in trying to source personal protective equipment for local doctors from Europe. Now, he used his expertise to procure PPE to send from China to Ireland.Cork rootsFrom Montenotte, he got in touch with fellow Corkmen, GP Nick Flynn and respiratory consultant Oisin O’Connell. A WhatsApp group was set up which has become a lively forum for sourcing equipment and exchanging ideas on how best to address problem areas as the pandemic approached. Many of the supply issues for PPE and ventilators were solved through contacts on this group.O’Brien organised teleconferences in which Chinese doctors from Wuhan shared their expertise in fighting coronavirus. Another Corkman, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, was brought in to lend “gravitas” and help nail deals for the supply of equipment.He also translated a 146-page protocol used in a Chinese hospital so it could advise Irish hospitals on how best to treat patients with the virus.Meanwhile, O’Brien’s own life is on hold. Having studied genetics and food science, he had gone to China to train as a doctor at Zhejiang University. He is now married to a local woman and they have a young child. He had been due to travel to the US to do his final exams for practising medicine there but this was scuppered by the pandemic. And while he has applied to Ireland On Call, his Chinese qualifications are unlikely to be recognised quickly enough back at home.He is, however, optimistic that Ireland will succeed in curbing the advance of the virus and that a vaccine will be developed more quickly than many people expect.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph:  Sean EliasPA Wire These are the hard weeks when remote working is more of a chore elimination of commuting doesn’t seem to matter when the same old walls of home fuel feelings of “let’s get this pandemic thing over”. Downbeat mood has coincided with those who want to get back to normal business becoming more assertive, with emphasis on the economy rather than public health. In their midst, are politicians who think they know better than scientists though it has to be said, they are more prevalent in the UK and US.So in a week, when the World Health Organisation got an unfair bashing on its pandemic response, it was good to see it hold its nerve and provide absolute clarity on easing restrictions. Ultimately, the behaviour of each of us will determine the behaviour of Covid-19. “This will take perseverance and patience, there is no fast-track back to normal,” it added. Any step to ease restrictions and transition must ensure:2. Public health and health system capacities including hospitals are in place to identify, isolate, test, trace contacts and quarantine them3. Outbreak risks are minimised in high-vulnerability settings particularly in elderly homes, mental health facilities and people residing in crowded places4. Workplace preventive measures are established – with physical distancing, handwashing facilities, respiratory etiquette in place5. Importation risks can be managed6. Communities have a voice and are engaged in the transition.The Irish report card on 1 is a tick done. On 2,3 and 4, not there yet – clusters in homes for older people and lack of workplace preparedness are big outstanding issues. On 5 and 6, almost there but not yet optimal.The really hot issue for leading virologists working on SARS-CoV-2 is what type of antibodies are generated by those who are infected. There is a clear preference for neutralising antibodies proteins that reduce and prevent infection by binding to the part of a virus that connects to and “unlocks” host cells. They are relatively easy to detect, and are far easier for vaccine developers to generate than the alternative, the immune system’s T cells. In contrast, non-neutralising antibodies still recognise parts of the pathogen, but don’t bind effectively and so do not prevent it from invading cells – and merely acting as an alert.Doctors are finding fairly high levels of neutralising antibodies in those having had Covid-19. “It is clear that immune responses are being mounted against Covid-19 in infected people,” virologist Mike Skinner of Imperial College London told the . Most virologists believe, however, immunity against Covid-19 will last only a year or two at best. “That is in line with other coronaviruses that infect humans,” Skinner added. That means that even if most people do eventually become exposed to the virus, “it is still likely to become endemic – which means we would see seasonal peaks of infection. We will have reached a steady state with regard to Covid-19.”Even if the antibodies stick around in the body it is not yet certain they will prevent future infection. Herd immunity cannot be banked on. Ultimately, development and roll-out of an effective vaccine is what will free us from the threat of Covid-19.Republic v NI – where science couldn’t be clearer:Differences between Ireland and the UK have been the focus of intensive debate notably on death rates testing and contact tracing. A data cruncher with the Financial Times, John Burn-Murdoch presents excellent graphics often including Ireland. What’s more, he provides a service for all-comers answering queries via twitter – where he doesn’t know, he promises to come back with answers.Recent graphics with commentaries confirm countries that locked down earlier in their outbreaks subsequently had much lower death tolls than those that locked down later – while accounting for when outbreaks began. There is only a weak link between population and Covid death toll though low population density helps. That amounts to strong mathematical evidence the key factor in lowering death rate is lockdown. Ireland scores really well on both in contrast to the UK which failed badly on acting quickly – debate over.It should shift urgently to focus on differences with Northern Ireland. For the Republic, the best way to build on progress is to have all-Ireland lockdown over coming weeks, where protocols match those in Northern Ireland there is no “border” and both sides benefit. Many of Ireland’s leading infectious disease specialists are at one on this the one missing ingredient is political willingness to make it happen. It’s a measure that will facilitate more extensive re-opening while reducing risk of Coronavirus 2. A memorandum of understanding exists, but sharp isions within the Northern Executive means actions in the best interests of citizens north and south are not being taken.A total of 78 potential vaccines are in development. An experimental vaccine that is deemed safe and effective enough to be rolled out in a limited way – to high-risk groups such as health workers – could be ready within weeks or months, under emergency rules developed by drug regulators.A Covid-19 vaccine could be completed by mid-August, according to a key adviser to the UK government Prof John Bell – human trials on one started at Oxford University last week.“If we can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on,” he added, adding the next step would then be “the massive issue of how you manufacture at scale many billions of doses”.The UK has shown shocking tardiness on the emerging pandemic, but is ahead of most countries in planning to scale up production of a vaccine immediately once approval is across the line. Grounds for optimism:Mission 1 accomplished: Coronavirus is “contained and effectively suppressed” in the Irish population at large. Mission 2 is apply the rigorous approach deployed in hospitals to homes for older people. Mission 3 is loosen restrictions informed by science to avoid the infamous yo-yo effect of viruses, ie repeated waves of infection. Vaccine progress: It took just a few months to generate 78 potential Covid-19 vaccines it took 20 years to reach that point in countering malaria.Testing backlog cleared: Through scientific endeavour, guile and availing of good international relations with suppliers and manufacturers. Ireland is moving to conducting 100,000 tests a week – a necessary step towards rapid test turnaround ability (in effect mass screening). That combined with robust surveillance including app technology makes up the essential mix to ease lockdown.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Despite recent episode of vandalism sculpture a \u0026lsquosite specific work\u0026rsquo, says Ruair\u0026iacute \u0026Oacute Cu\u0026iacutevLocal authorities will be told by the Goverment not to grant licences for large eventsForthcoming TG4 documentary to run rule over state of the last Irish-speaking regionsRobbery of McDonald\u0026rsquos, Liffey Valley, Clondalkin, to feed serial offender\u0026rsquos drug habitGarda\u0026iacute have held 32 people for breaching movement restrictions since April 8thSupporters crowd into courtroom and are cleared by garda\u0026iacute due to social distancingCountries have acted independently of each other but those that acted early look to have got it rightFamily doctors say consultations should only be carried out where they are necessaryMonaghan man Ronan Hughes appears before High Court on foot of European Arrest WarrantNational Lottery confirms winner was purchased at Daly\u0026rsquos Supervalu in KillarneyDubliner Conor McMeel is studying for a PhD in computer science in Imperial CollegeAssessing the eruption threat is a complicated business, with fluids, gases, stresses and rock strengths among the many variablesGarda\u0026iacute believe recovered package contains approximately \u0026euro21,000 worth of cocaine, pending analysisIreland\u0026rsquos largest-ever triathlon event would have been worth \u0026euro8m to the local economyDonohoe to give Cabinet outline of Covid-19 toll on finances before submission to EuropeAs troubles mount in the North\u0026rsquos nursing homes, families and carers feel the strain\u0026lsquoYou may at times be required to change Family Unit,\u0026rsquo company document statesFirst Covid-19 case in small south Dublin care home was confirmed last weekGroup had lived for many months at the Travelodge where the guest had fallen illStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4233624.1587411685!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"keelings ask fruit pickers to segregate in family units","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Social distancing guidelines should be followed at all times where reasonably practicable.’ Photograph: Alan BetsonFruit pickers at Keelings have been placed in “family units” segregated from other workers in a bid to reduce any risk of spreading coronavirus, company documents show.Keelings, which came under fire for bringing in Bulgarian workers on chartered flights, set out guidelines on how staff should associate with others, including members of the public.Its policy, based on guidance from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, also tells employees they may be expected to move family and cannot congregate in groups of more than 49 people.“As a ‘Family Unit’, you will be rostered to jobs together, travel together, use the canteen together and share accommodation facilities,” a company document states.“Social distancing guidelines should be followed at all times where reasonably practicable, however in buses and canteens, the 2m social distancing guidelines must apply between different family groups or iniduals.”On board buses, family units must sit together and leave an empty bench space between themselves and the next group.“You should know at all times what Family Unit you belong to. You may at times be required to change Family Unit,” the document sets out.The company did not respond to requests for clarity on the nature of accommodation it provides to workers, who have also been asked to practise 2m distancing in public spaces.There has been some concern among residents of a Co Louth town where 111 of the Keelings employees are being housed, given that they have been circulating in the area.However, deputy mayor of Drogheda Cllr Michelle Hall said much of the earlier anxiety had eased when it was discovered those residents were not part of the group that arrived in Ireland last week.Ms Hall, who has maintained contact with the company, previously outlined her discomfort that workers “are being put at risk by living together in such high numbers”.Groceries deliveredIn a statement Keelings said the 189 recent arrivals were adhering to HSE guidance on restricted movement and that groceries were being delivered to them. Company management declined to be interviewed.The north Dublin company is reliant on about 900 seasonal labourers and is unable to source anything near the sufficient level of local applicants to fill the roles. It is estimated to be one of the biggest such producers in the country. However, many other farms employ seasonal workers from abroad and the practice is common in other EU countries.According to the Irish Farmers’ Association, Germany is accepting 80,000 during April and May. The UK is reliant on a similar number, and farmers and recruiters there have also begun to use charter flights.Seasonal workers must be paid the minimum wage in Ireland, although it is understood they can earn up to about €15 an hour. It is unclear how much Keelings pays its workers, although the role of crop walker – which includes monitoring growth – earns €10.80 per hour, according to documents.An industry source said seasonal workers came to Ireland early this year in order to comply with rules on restriction of movement on arrival.Although Taoiseach Leo Varadkar suggested the Government would look at how Irish workers might fill seasonal jobs, the source said harvesting without imported labour would be unmanageable.“These people are critical elements of the harvest.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4234374.1587486758!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"snas to back students with disabilities using phones or laptops","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe union Fórsa  said that special needs assistants could use their own phone, tablet or laptop to carry out the work.

It said support to students would be delivered remotely.The union said this could either be done through working in a HSE office or from home.There has been significant unease among special needs assistants and their union representatives at the role they would play under the Government’s plan to redeploy staff across the public service during the current Covid-19 crisis.Earlier this month the union instructed special needs assistants not to co-operate with any reassignment as other than to remote support roles to assist students with special educational needs.Fórsa said at the time it could not accept that any special needs assistant “should be compulsorily reassigned as a healthcare assistant – a role for which, in the vast majority of cases, they are not qualified”.However, on Tuesday the union said the HSE had now finalised the details of a new service which special needs assistants would provide help during the school-closure period.“SNAs will be asked to provide support to those students in receipt of HSE disability services by way of remote working through the use of telephones, smart phones or laptops. They will receive direction and information from a HSE point of contact who will be a clinician, such as a speech and language therapist, psychologist or occupational therapist who is familiar with the student and will explain what support each student and family might require. Some will need a quick call at certain points in the day, other students might require a longer period of face time. The HSE is responsible for providing advice, information and materials to be used in service delivery.The union said that special needs assistants could use their own phone, tablet or laptop to carry out this work.“SNAs will be matched with students, wherever possible this will be their own allocated student(s).

The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

File photograph: The The State’s Irish-speaking regions have been allowed dwindle so much they have been reduced to “Indian reservations” ignored by the State and by successive governments, according to a new TG4 documentary on Gaeltacht.Gaeltacht 2020 is a two-part investigation on the state of the country’s last Irish-speaking regions where the combined populations number no more than that of a large Irish town. Presenter Eibhlín Ní Chonghaile visits all the remaining regions – from the smallest, Rinn in Co Waterford, to the largest, south Connemara. The others are south Kerry, west Kerry, Baile Bhúirne, the Donegal Gaeltachtaí and Belmullet in Co Mayo. The number of people living in regions where Irish remains the dominant tongue has shrank to 17,000, it says. That stark number is a “national emergency” and needs an immediate and concerted response, says Prof Gearóid Ó\u0026nbspTuathaigh.Language activist Donncha Ó hÉallaithe sets out how the Irish revival movement failed after the foundation of the State. In a series of maps he demonstrates how the Gaeltachtaí, in real terms, have shrunk from large tracts all along the western seaboard in 1926 to small slivers of land in 2020. These are areas when two-thirds of the people still use Irish as a first language. When the number of Irish speakers drops below 50 per cent, he says, decline happens precipitously, as has happened in areas still designated as Gaelteacht regions but where few people speak Irish. He says the official Gaeltachtaí bear no relation to reality any more. Areas such as Tirellan and Menlo in Galway city are still officially designated even though there are few or no native speakers in either area. Ms Ní Chonghaile and director Seán Ó Cualáin visited all the Gaeltachtaí to ask local communities about the roots of the decline and what could be done to save Irish as a primary language. Their remote geographic locations means Gaeltachtaí have long been economically deprived and adversely affected by unemployment, rural depopulation and emigration. In the small Gaeltacht on the Iveragh peninsula in south Kerry, some 80 Irish speaking townlands have now deserted over the past 50 years.Udarás na Gaeltachta, which promotes development in these regions, has helped in stemming the flow. But many of the manufacturing jobs have been lost because they could not compete on a cost basis with China. Senator and entrepreneur Pádraig Ó Céidigh from An Spidéal in Connemara does not pull his punches. “I do not think the State has the remotest interest in the Gaeltacht, its people or in the culture of the country”, he has told the programme. “The Gaeltachtaí are like an Indian reservation. We will throw them a few pennies to keep them happy and that will tick a box for us.”From the perspective of Gaeltacht people, the need to create meaningful jobs is highest on the agenda. So are house prices where locals cannot afford to buy against wealthier families buying holiday homes. In Rinn, an affordable housing scheme for Irish speaking families is now being promoted. Poor infrastructure, including roads and broadband, are also mooted, as are adverse planning and environmental laws. However, the documentary also looks at some of the newer success stories such as a digital hub in Gweedore called G-Teic which has superfast broadband and has helped people work from there. Údarás na Gaeltachta also attracted a high-tech medtech company, Randox, to Gweedore. There have been some great local innovations using natural resources such as the highly successful Folláin jam company in Cúil Aodha, Cork. Also Louis Mulcahy’s pottery shop in Dún Chaoin, Kerry, the Uisce water-sport summer school in Belmullet, as well as the aquarium in Dingle. \u0026nbsp‘Huge resource’Ms Ní Chonghaile says that some of the great resources are not used enough, including the sea. A marine expert, Séamus Breathnach, states: “Feamainn, tá sé gnéasach faoi láthair (Seaweed, it’s sexy right now).”The language itself, argues Ms Ní Chonghaile, is a huge resource – its preservation, ironically, is in itself a creator of employment.\u0026nbspThe message from the communities is that they themselves must fight for the survival of the language as nobody else will do it. Harking back to Gluaiseacht Chearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta 50 years ago, NUIG historian Gearóid Ó Tuathaigh says the Gaeltachtaí are now facing their own emergency.\u0026nbspGaeltacht 2020 begins on TG4 on Wednesday, April 22, at 9.30pm."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4233657.1587415437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"all eyes on sweden s liberal gamble with coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople pass by an outdoor restaurant in central Stockholm on Monday. Official guidance in Sweden says citizens can still go out for a meal as long as they stay ‘at arm’s length’ from each other. Photograph: Anders WiklundEPAAn outlier in Europe, Sweden’s apparently relaxed approach to the coronavirus pandemic is an international subject of fascination, provoking controversy at home and abroad and becoming a cause célèbre among those who oppose strict lockdowns. As protesters rallied against a stay-at-home order in Minnesota last week, one demonstrator held up a poster among the American flags reading “Be like Sweden”.Pubs, restaurants, gyms and most schools remain open in the Scandinavian state, with the government relying on personal responsibility for compliance rather than strict enforcement. Official guidance states that citizens can still go out to a nightclub or go out for a meal with friends, as long as they stay at “arm’s length” from each other.So far, the pandemic has killed 1,580 people in the country according to national figures, lower as a proportion of the population than in the United Kingdom, Italy or Spain. But when compared to neighbouring countries that did impose lockdowns, the Swedish death rate is nine times higher than Finland, nearly five times higher than Norway, and over twice that of Denmark.ImmunityThe man behind the Swedish strategy, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, told local media over the weekend that projections by the Public Health Agency indicated resistance was building in the population.“According to our modellers, we are starting to see so many immune people in the population in Stockholm that it is starting to have an effect on the spread of the infection,” Tegnell said. “These are mathematical models, they’re only as good as the data we put into them. We will see if they are right.”Tegnell’s assumption that people become immune to the virus is controversial. The World Health Organisation has warned that there is so far no proof of immunity in those who have recovered from Covid-19.Sweden’s approach is also controversial at home: 22 leading doctors, virologists and researchers last week called on Swedish authorities to change course “radically and quickly” and close restaurants and schools. Over 900 teachers and school workers signed an open letter to say they were unable to protect vulnerable children and staff.And despite the Public Health Agency saying that its priority was to protect the elderly, a third of deaths have been of residents of care homes, a fact that has also caused public blowback.While the rules are less strict than elsewhere in Europe, those living within Sweden insist that the idea that life continues as normal in the country is far from the truth. In Stockholm, the amount of people moving around the city has been less than a third of its usual level since late March, according to statistics from transport app Citymapper. Residents describe traffic-free roads, quiet streets, and people careful to keep their distance.“A lot of people think Sweden’s open for business and everything is open as usual, but Swedes are taking this very seriously,” said Cormac O’Brien, an IT worker living with his family in Gothenburg and originally from Malahide.“The pubs are open, but I went to one on Saturday and it was empty. Would that be the case if they opened in Dublin? You can’t say if it works in Sweden you should do it elsewhere. Some of it is cultural.”AdvantagesThe country has some natural advantages, including a health system that has not yet reached capacity from the pandemic. It is also more easily able to encourage isolation without strict measures: some 40 per cent of households in Sweden are made up of just a single person, and a large proportion of people are able to work from home.Irrespective of whether immunity turns out to be a reality, or a vaccine can be developed, countries that slowed infection early will be better able to make decisions that save lives, according to Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.“Even if we all end up being exposed to it, imagine if we could predict early on who would develop severe symptoms, and who would recover easily?” Prof Sridhar said. “Basically, regardless of where this goes . . . the countries that bought time by quick action and keeping numbers low are in a better position to create informed policy.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Oxford vaccine trial to be tested on people from Thursday, reveals Matt Hancock Politics latest news: Watch live as Matt Hancock gives daily coronavirus updateWhy are so many black and ethnic minority people dying from coronavirus?Medals of a Battle of Britain hero who inspired Tom Hardy role in Dunkirk up for saleLaunch of contact-tracing app in Italy dogged by concerns over privacy and national security Britain’s islands ready to break lockdown and become testing grounds for contact-tracing technologyJudge expresses \u0026#39huge regret\u0026#39 after woman dies by suicide while waiting for court case to concludeDental patients pulling out their own teeth due to dentist shortage sparked by lack of PPEDrinking alcohol in pregnancy is linked to depression in teenagers, study suggestsExclusive: Millions of pieces of PPE being shipped from Britain to Europe despite NHS shortagesHow many coronavirus cases are in your area?

At a time when relatives are saying tearful farewells over FaceTime and a shattered global economy has left millions fearing for the future, our vapid Prince and Princess across the water have chosen to launch a broadside against the media from their Hollywood hideout. Though they claim to value press freedom, their actions amount to a kind of censorship it is obvious that they hope to trade in critical coverage for that of a more deferential flavour, delivered by journalists they have helped choose in advance. Both the self-pitying tone and unfortunate timing carry echoes of the Duke of Windsor, who spent much of World War Two holed up in comfy exile, furiously lobbying the Government to grant his wife HRH status. Most of Team Sussex’s output reads like a cross between a self-congratulatory LinkedIn post and a faux-profound lifestyle blog, and today’s instalment did not disappoint. Apart from the narcissism on display, the letter is replete with corporate gibberish (“to spotlight”, “policy being instated”) and pompous melodrama no longer, they say, will they offer themselves up as currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion. Given their desire for a less prominent role in public life, however, they seem rather too eager to mention that they remain a Duke and Duchess. The statement contains almost one reminder of their continued royal status per paragraph. Their PR strategy has always been a case of one step forward, ten steps back. Last year, the pair rounded off a triumphant tour of Africa, which had accrued countless positive UK media headlines, by launching legal action against the Mail on Sunday. Days ago, the couple were photographed delivering food to the needy in Los Angeles, looking down to earth and striking exactly the right note for the situation. Today’s developments will overshadow their good work once again. In recent years, their stock in Britain has plummeted, as overwhelming national goodwill and joy at their wedding gave way to irritation, then outright annoyance, at their hypocrisies. Yet this morning’s missive coincides with the Duchess’s first promotional interview since the pair shelved their royal duties, to discuss a new voiceover role in a Disney Plus documentary about elephants. (Meghan would know all about packing your trunk and saying goodbye to the circus.) While their disdain for the British people is increasingly obvious, choosing such a climactic moment to indulge in this bizarre rant seems calculated to boost their profile Stateside. The Sussexes’ failed attempt to combine their royal status with that of the celebrity influencer shows the tough predicament facing today’s royals. It is harder than ever for them to lead by example, in the style of previous royals such as Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who used their platform to extol the domestic virtues of monogamy and family life. Society is simply less deferential, the press and public more alert to hypocrisy. Where once it guided morals and mores, the Royal Family is now more likely to influence fashion at best - and at worst, to mirror contemporary irritations back at us. In the Sussexes’ case, they have come to embody the excesses of identity politics. Their paranoid loathing of the press suggests they inhabit a world of perceived slights and victim status. Their demands for uncritical respect and supplication from the media, while complaining of mistreatment from a privileged position, reflects the combination of bullying and performative victimhood unique to these identitarian times. Their initial move to Canada gave the Sussexes the chance to combine duty with greater privacy. They could have lived a more retired life, while working on behalf of the Queen and promoting Commonwealth interests. Instead they’ve spent the time building a pair of vapid lifestyle brands, the now-defunct ‘Sussex Royal’ and ‘Archwell’, which sound like a cigarette manufacturer and a line of corrective footwear, respectively. Too woke even for Trudeau’s Canada, they scuttled out in a private jet just before full lockdown, proving that their goal was Los Angeles (a town famed for its privacy and modesty) and the lure of elephant voiceovers, all along. While the Sussexes were busy burning the last of their bridges with the British people, other family members are shining more brightly by contrast. The Queen’s dignified restraint as she consoled and encouraged her people amid one of the severest crises of her long reign was deeply moving. Prince Philip may have stepped back from public life on the grounds of his great age, but he still put out a stirring statement honouring unsung frontline workers earlier today. Despite their slightly earnest mode of speech, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge radiated genuine concern as they spoke to teachers via Zoom last week. The message from all of them – ‘It’s not just about Me.’Coronavirus latest news: Oxford vaccine trial to be tested on people from Thursday, reveals Matt Hancock Politics latest news: Watch live as Matt Hancock gives daily coronavirus updateWhy are so many black and ethnic minority people dying from coronavirus?Medals of a Battle of Britain hero who inspired Tom Hardy role in Dunkirk up for saleLaunch of contact-tracing app in Italy dogged by concerns over privacy and national security Britain’s islands ready to break lockdown and become testing grounds for contact-tracing technologyJudge expresses \u0026#39huge regret\u0026#39 after woman dies by suicide while waiting for court case to concludeDental patients pulling out their own teeth due to dentist shortage sparked by lack of PPEDrinking alcohol in pregnancy is linked to depression in teenagers, study suggestsExclusive: Millions of pieces of PPE being shipped from Britain to Europe despite NHS shortagesHow many coronavirus cases are in your area?

Truth be told, in any scenario, I don\u0027t do \u0027single\u0027 drinks. Two glasses of wine is my minimum. I live with a friend who is aligned with me on this front, so each evening we open a nice bottle to accompany dinner. Never once, in all the time we\u0027ve been under the same roof, have we found need to put the cork back in before retiring to bed.Which is to say that I definitely consume half a bottle a night, which is five units, which is double what the NHS deems to be acceptable for a woman.I\u0027m probably not alone in this. Indeed, it is so very British that even in a global pandemic, when our borders are sealed and everything from restaurants to churches have been shut down, that off-licences are still deemed \u0027essential\u0027. In South Africa, alcohol has been banned altogether during lockdown. Can. You. Imagine? The British public has been really very compliant with the restrictions placed on our lives and livelihoods throughout these drastic times, but consider, for a moment, the reaction were Dominic Raab to announce that from tomorrow, all shelves would be stripped of booze for the foreseeable future. I predict a riot. Our government, thank goodness, wouldn\u0027t dream of it. Historically speaking (and daily, for many at the moment) alcohol runs through our blood. During the medieval period, water was unsanitary, and so instead we drank ale. Everyone was a bit trollied, all the time.In the East, incidentally, rather than ferment water to make it safe, they boiled it to make tea, which explains why Asians still typically have a much lower tolerance to alcohol and possibly why they got so much more done than Europeans back in those Dark Ages. It\u0027s always been legal here in the West - the only exception being when the Lutherans outlawed it (ultimately unsuccessfully) in the US during Prohibition in the 1920s. Their intentions were noble namely to tackle alcoholism and violence. And of course, if such a substance were invented today, it would be a Class A drug - alcohol very much does incite addiction and aggression. It is no surprise then, that since South Africa banned it during lockdown, there have been 9,000 fewer alcohol-related hospital admissions a week.Anyway, alcohol has long been both legal and essential in British society, for better or worse, and has long been essential to me. It coloured my teenage years and was a cohort through my 20s. It has elevated dinner parties and enhanced holidays. It has provided the Dutch courage I\u0027ve required to deliver wedding speeches and to talk to people I fancy without going red. It is not the bedrock of my personality, but as one oft-quoted meme goes, \u0027No, Karen, you don\u0027t need alcohol to have fun. You don\u0027t need running shoes to run either, but it sure helps.\u0027It has certainly helped me during lockdown, chiefly as the daily punctuation mark between work and \u0027home\u0027 time - now otherwise one in the same thing. My father - a lawyer who practises from his house on a hill in the middle of nowhere and is thus well-versed in a life of isolation - has always poured himself a glass of whiskey every evening at 6pm when the grandfather clock chimes, to toast the end of office hours. I have adopted the same habit. So that\u0027s half a bottle of wine and a whiskey a day.In the strange new-normal in which we now find ourselves, where we don\u0027t really get a change of scene, that nightly elixir at least transports our neurological matter to a different state from work-driven focus to sofa-appropriate platitude. I have a restless mind, and tend to pace like a cat when I\u0027m bored. Lockdown can be boring, and part of alcohol\u0027s enduring appeal is that it takes down the intelligence a few notches. So I can think less and potter, like a dog. It is truly the one reliable pleasure I look forward to each day. Perhaps most significantly of all, I am, like my father, one of those lucky few who don\u0027t really suffer hangovers - not unless I get well and truly hammered, which is very rare, and even then not if I have a decent lie-in.So what\u0027s the problem, you might say? Too many units a day, that\u0027s the problem worthy of a good finger-wagging from the GP. It\u0027s bound to catch up with me at some point. That tolerance will only creep higher. Most years, I do Dry January for this very reason. Sometimes, after a particularly excessive holiday, I have a little chat with myself, and agree to take a week off so as to reset the meter. That time has come again. If you\u0027ve seen the 1989 cult classic that is Withnail and I, you\u0027ll know what I mean when I say that while Withnail\u0027s drunken countryside antics are all very amusing for the majority of the film, it is not, for him, a very happy ending. I choose, therefore, to be his (only slightly) more responsible companion, Marwood, and wind up back at work when this quasi-holiday is over, not morose, swigging wine alone in a park.And so for the next seven days, it\u0027s the sober life for me. Dinners will be a little less enjoyable. The days will, I imagine, feel longer. But unless Leonardo Di Caprio shows up at my door for a surprise visit, I at least won\u0027t have to worry about going red in front of someone I fancy. The sensible thing, after I\u0027ve completed this period of abstinence, would then be to have an end-of-work whiskey not every day, but every other day. And to have one glass of wine with dinner, only three days a week. But these are unpredictable times. It would be rash to make such grandoise promises.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

If they test positive, they will be told to self-isolate for a fortnight. The contract tracers, who will need only a few hours\u0027 training, could form part of a slowly emerging exit strategy from lockdown measures in Belgium and are likely to be in work until a vaccine is found. Belgium’s National Security Council, which is expected to meet on Friday to discuss the exit strategy, said 170 people had died from coronavirus in the country in the last 24 hours, which takes the total to 5,998 victims since the pandemic began. Belgium intends to gradually phase out the restrictions from May 4. The thinking is the “detectives” could help eliminate new sources of infection as quickly as possible as restrictions are relaxed and so prevent the need to return to lockdown. The government is also drawing up regulations for the use of a contract tracer mobile phone app. Regulators in Belgium and at European Union level are mulling how to take advantage of the technology, while respecting EU privacy laws. The app uses bluetooth technology in smartphones to keep track of possible contacts and infections between people. If a user tests positive for coronavirus, everyone who has been in contact with them gets a notification on their phone. A European Commission exit strategy recommended that contract tracer apps should be anonymous and based on consent. Once the legal framework is ready, the investigators will still be needed because the technology will not be completely successful, the De Tijd newspaper reported.  They are expected to prioritise tracking down iniduals who do not download the app. Belgium, which has a population of 11.5 million, has the highest per capita death rate from coronavirus in the world. The authorities insist the reason for that is they are more diligent in reporting deaths. Belgium includes care home deaths and suspected deaths, as well as those following positive tests, in their tallies. Some 53 per cent of the almost 6,000 deaths so far are thought to have happened in Belgium’s care homes. There have been 40,956 confirmed cases of the virus so far but the number of people taken to hospital over the last four days has been steadily declining. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up future safe air travel","story":"We\u0027ve all seen those Utopian visions of what aeroplanes looked like 70-odd years ago, all silver service, grinning children and reclining sofa-seats more comfortable than your current favourite armchair.Unfortunately on closer inspection most of those photos aren\u0027t what they purport to be, generally they were optimistic mock-ups of what the future of air travel might look like.Very few predicted the reality of deep vein thrombosis, babies who can cry louder than most road-repairing equipment and soggy green beans obliterated in a microwave until they\u0027re hotter than the sun.What is in store for aeroplanes now, whenever we\u0027re allowed back on them?

The story accused the Government of falling down on PPE “despite assurances from ministers that there’s enough to go round”. The “boss” reportedly described the Government’s claim there was no shortage of gowns as “fantasy”.This sounded odd to me. Was the NHS boss so clueless that he had to ask our national broadcaster how to get hold of Burberry? If so, could one trust him to get PPE from anywhere? I was also suspicious of the fact that the source refused to speak directly and that the Today programme which followed the news did not follow up the report. It seemed sketchy.Later that day, modestly concealed in the Business section of the BBC News website, a “correction” appeared: “We should clarify that the person concerned is not the boss of an NHS trust but is part of a network of organisations helping to source personal protective equipment for some NHS trusts. The mistake was caused by a misunderstanding of the person’s role in the fight against the pandemic.”The correction understated the problem. If the person looking for Burberry was not an NHS boss, but only someone who was helping chase PPE gowns, it was not worthy of the national news at all, let alone the hourly lead. The BBC’s “misunderstanding of the person’s role” collapsed the entire tale.How did this story get broadcast, then? Only, one must presume, because of “confirmation bias” – the tendency to find what you want, regardless of whether it is there. Every day in the Covid-19 crisis, the BBC wants stories which allow it to side with another largely unaccountable national institution, the NHS, and against the Government.This is not impartial, properly checked news. It also, I suspect, conflicts with the public mood. Obviously people want incompetence exposed, but in this crisis the difficulties are sufficiently acute for most people to be less concerned with pillorying ministers, more with trying to help. The BBC never sees this.Apparently, 36,000 unexpectedly unemployed British people have applied to “Pick for Britain” on farms this summer, and only 112 so far have contracts signed. There is some ill feeling that farmers are continuing to fly in workers from Bulgaria and Romania. Why not employ our own, people ask, and why bring in people who might spread coronavirus?On first hearing, one sympathises, but the sad fact is that sudden unemployment is easier to achieve than sudden employment. Yesterday, I spoke to a fruit farmer in the south-east, who explained how it looks to him.In the course of the season, he employs up to 1,200 people to pick strawberries, raspberries and so on. He hopes to recruit more British workers than in the past, but finds that in practice few young British people tolerate back-breaking, finger-chafing picking and cutting for 60 hours a week at the minimum wage. Very few have rural upbringings. They are untrained for the work involved, are often students, and usually not local. Those filling in online forms this month because of their unsought idleness may like the sound of working outdoors in summer (1,500 have applied to him), but his past experience tells him that only one per cent will stay the course.He also points out that the lockdown will probably end in June. At that point, the British workers would probably depart, leaving the raspberries unpicked.Eastern Europeans, by contrast, are used to agricultural labour and keen on the work, because it pays more than four times their home rates. On his farms, half of the workers who come one year return the next. They come legally, currently under EU rules after any forthcoming trade deal, they will arrive under the seasonal workers’ agricultural labour scheme which the Government has promised to expand. The labourers are socially distanced from the wider community because they are housed in caravans on the farms.Besides, says my friend, even if every single one of the 36,000 British applicants got a place, our fruit farms would still be roughly 50,000 workers adrift of the over 85,000 they need this year. Without the Romanians and Bulgarians, the crops would simply rot and the British public would have to buy their fruit from places like Morocco instead.All this is slightly unwelcome news unwelcome but, I suspect, true.As a writer on one of the few newspapers not cast into darkness by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, I suppose I should feel privileged. Actually, I feel a little disappointed. My message to their semi-Royal Highnesses is: “Please extend to me the ‘zero engagement’ you have offered my tabloid brothers. At present, the big story is a global virus, killing tens of thousands of people and decimating economies. In these circumstances, I would quite like to be released from any opportunity to cover the activities of your new non-profit empire, Archewell, and whatever else you may find to do in Los Angeles.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

And what will happen next?Throughout the coronavirus outbreak two phrases ‘flatten the curve’ and ‘reach the peak’ have been repeated on an almost daily basis. Flattening the curve, or “squashing the sombrero” as Boris Johnson said on March 12, refers to the graph showing the rise in new infections, which resembles a bell curve. The aim is to flatten the height of that curve, meaning a reduction in the number of infections and lowering the potential death toll. This strategy is also in place to prevent a surge of hospital admissions, which could overwhelm the NHS, and allow time for a vaccine to be developed.The peak can relate to three different measures the number of new infections, the daily death toll and the number of active cases - though it is most often referred to in relation to new infections.When the daily case count stops sharply rising, flattens off and starts to decrease, this means the peak has been reached. This is not seen in a single day, but a gradual trend of decreasing case counts symbolises the end of a surge.Both Government advisers and independent experts have suggested the peak in UK coronavirus infections has now been reached, with data showing a stabilisation in new cases.During the Government’s daily press briefing on April 15 Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said the virus was probably reaching the peak overall in the UK, and that there was a flattening of the number of deaths.That day, 761 deaths were announced in the UK, making it the fourth consecutive day that fewer than 800 deaths were reported - following a high of 980 on April 10.But, Prof Whitty warned: At the moment we are not yet at the point we can say confidently and safely this is now past the peak. The following day, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, announced the lockdown would be extended for “at least” another three weeks.Mr Raab explained during the daily briefing that lifting the measures now would be a risk to both public health and the economy. We still don\u0027t have the infection rate down as far as we need to, he said.The number of deaths increased again a few days later to 888 on April 18 but have since continued to fall. On April 20 449 deaths were confirmed, the lowest daily increase in two weeks. During the No 10 press conference that day, Dr Angela McLean, the Ministry of Defence Chief Scientific Adviser, said the rate of infection in the UK has “stopped rising”.Referring to the latest government data, recorded between March 21 and April 20, Dr McLean said: “The relief that you get when you look at that picture is that it has stopped rising and (it is now) pretty much stable and flat.”She added that for the seventh day in a row the number of hospital admissions in London have fallen. “We’re looking forward to seeing that pattern replicated across other regions of the country,” she said.  Scientists at the University of Oxford have suggested the peak in English hospital deaths was in fact reached much earlier. Professor Carl Heneghan, Director of the Centre of Evidence Based Medicine and Professor Jason Oke, Senior Statistician at the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, said their modelling shows the peak occurred in London on April 4, four days ahead of the rest of the country on April 8.Some European countries have begun easing lockdown measures as their infection and death rates continue to fall. Germany declared the coronavirus outbreak “manageable” last week after bringing the reproduction factor — the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to — under 1 for the first time.Shops have begun to reopen, but restaurants and bars remain closed and travel bans remain. Angela Merkel, the Germany Chancellor, urged citizens to remain disciplined. In Poland, parks and forests will reopen and in Norway children will return to nursery from this week. In the UK, the lockdown measures remain unchanged, but there are hopes the country will follow our European counterparts if the infection rates continue to remain low. For now, the Government has urged the population to continue following the social distancing guidelines. You must leave your home only:It is vital, in order to stop the spread of the virus, to stay home and not mix with people outside of your household. Social distancing applies to everyone, even if you are not displaying any symptoms. You should not be meeting up with friends and family or going to work if you can work from home. When out in public, you must maintain a distance of two metres from others.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kim jong un would successor","story":"Unconfirmed rumours of Kim Jong-un’s declining health status immediately triggered speculation on Tuesday about who could succeed him at the helm of the most secretive regime in the world. It remains unknown whether the North Korean leader, who is believed to be only 36, has officially designated a successor, or whether the reclusive country would be temporarily ruled by an elite group of elders and figureheads. However, several known figures would be expected to play an influential role.As his own children would be too young to immediately take over the reins of the family dynasty, focus has rested on Kim Yo Jong, his younger sister and trusted confidante, to maintain the so-called “Mount Paektu” bloodline that has ruled the hermit kingdom for three generations. Kim Yo Jong, believed to be 31, is already seen as her brother’s de facto chief of staff and exercises significant influence in the top echelons of power.She was recently elevated to the party’s powerful politburo and earlier this year issued a scathing political statement about South Korea in her own name. She has firm control of key party functions, setting herself up to be the main source of power behind a collective leadership, and has been credited in the past for modernising her brother’s image. In recent years, she has been seen at his side during major international summits with the US and South Korean presidents or travelling to South Korea during the 2018 Winter Olympics as an envoy in her own right. But although Kim Yo Jong’s rise would keep the regime within the family business, it remains to be seen whether she would be allowed to take over the top job as a woman. The sudden demise of her brother could lead to political upheaval or even regime collapse. Alternatively, Kim Yo Jong could remain a figurehead alongside an elite group of senior party figures collectively steering the country through the turmoil of a leaderless country facing both the coronavirus and rising tensions with the US over its nuclear weapons programme. At the forefront would be Vice Marshal Choe Ryong Hae, 70, who has previously also been touted as a possible successor, and who rose to be the North’s nominal head of state last year when he was promoted to president of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly. It was the reward for long service in the ruling party and decades of loyalty to the ruling Kim family. He previously held the position of political head of the North’s military under the young leader. In 2019, he was one of three senior officials sanctioned by the US for human rights abuses. Choe is often seen at high-level events with Pak Pong Ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North’s push to introduce more free market functions to revive its economy and help it survive sanctions, and who would likely keep his influential role. Kim Yong Chol, a party vice chairman and former top nuclear envoy who previously served as intelligence chief, would be an obvious choice to help lead the country’s international diplomacy efforts, including the stalled denuclearisation talks with Donald Trump, the US president. Kim would likely be supported by his former right-hand man Ri Son Gwon, the recently appointed foreign minister, who previously led high level talks with South Korea and who is an experienced hand in military talks after serving as a senior colonel in the national army.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nazanin zaghari ratcliffe relieved furlough extended one month","story":"British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s temporary release from an Iranian prison has been extended for another month, as her family continues to campaign for her freedom.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was jailed in Iran on controversial spying charges in 2016, was among thousands of prisoners temporarily released in March due to the coronavirus pandemic.Her family said she was “very relieved” as her lawyer was told on Tuesday that her furlough would be extended until May 20.Prosecutors declined to say whether she would be granted a more permanent “clemency” and avoid returning to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where she has been serving a five year sentence for spying, which she denies.Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has previously pledged to grant a permanent pardon to thousands of prisoners as his country grapples with the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, is currently staying at her parents’ house in Tehran, although is forced to wear an ankle tag and with strict restrictions on her movement.Her husband Richard Ratcliffe said that his wife had been under real psychological strain in the last few days, as her father and lawyer made repeated visits to the Iranian Prosecutor’s Office to see if her temporary release would be extended.The to-ing and fro-ing every few days creates a direct exposure to political bargaining, and for Nazanin a real psychological strain, Mr Ratcliffe said on Twitter.Other dual nationals, including British-Iranian businessman Anoosheh Ashoori, 65, and British-Australian academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert, are still being held as “political prisoners” in Evin, despite calls for their release.Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s MP, Tulip Siddiq, said today: Very happy to hear from Richard Ratcliffe that Nazanin\u0027s furlough has been extended for a month - in line with other prisoners in Iran.Now is the time for our government to do all it can to make it permanent. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/04/16/TELEMMGLPICT000229681714_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"need talk uncomfortable link obesity coronavirus","story":"Have fears of becoming a Nanny State stopped us confronting Britain\u0026#39s obesity problem?Let\u0027s launch a national diet campaign now to save livesFor a month we have been looking at international stats on Covid-19 trying to piece together the puzzle. Men are worse affected than women, older people are more likely to suffer, those with underlying health issues are especially vulnerable, and BAME groups are disproportionately represented among critically ill patients.Still, one pattern that has stimulated less discussion is the number of critically ill Covid-19 patients who are overweight or obese.The scientific journal Nature stated on April 2nd: “Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are the most common comorbidities in patients with coronavirus infections. Emerging evidence demonstrates an important direct metabolic and endocrine mechanistic link to the viral disease process.”The same ailments keep emerging: diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Data from the first 2204 Covid ICU admissions show 73 per cent were overweight, a condition linked to those diseases.Not only does carrying more visceral weight put greater pressure on the lungs, excess body fat causes the immune system to dysfunction, instigating the cytokine storm that floods lungs causing pneumonia-like complications.For decades successive governments have been negligent in tackling obesity head on. Whether it’s subservience to the food and drink industry that contributes almost £30bn to the economy, or an aversion to becoming a Nanny State, obesity has ballooned without concerted intervention. More than half of the British diet is ultra-processed food with 60 per cent of the population overweight.The OECD places the UK the sixth most obese country in the world. South Korea, at the bottom of the table, has a far lower death rate from Covid-19.Approximately only one in eight Brits are metabolically healthy. The Government’s own statistics say obesity causes over 30,000 deaths each year, cuts an average nine years off life and makes an inidual more than twice as likely to develop high blood pressure and five times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes. The Department of Health estimates the cost of obesity to society is £27 billion a year, with annual spend on treatment greater than that spent on the police, fire service and judicial system combined.During normal times, a government might shy away from interfering in the contents of people’s fridges. But we have a national health emergency, and for once, a captive audience. Yet without bankable advice to physically prepare for the virus, supermarket shelves are devoid of flour and sugar while Mr Kipling has reported an astronomical sales surge.A controlled diet can start to reverse high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes in weeks. I can vouch for that. I am whipping a septuagenarian parent into shape, and in three weeks, they have lost three kilograms and have registered a marked change in blood pressure that should lead to coming off medication.For the first time in living history, the public are stuck at home cooking for themselves while glued to the airwaves desperate to know how to protect themselves. Changing habits is said to take three weeks, the time it takes to see improvement in metabolic health following significant dietary change. We have at least three weeks more of lockdown to come.Not only would a massive public campaign on diet save lives from Covid-19, it would change the course of our nation’s health forever.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Schools, restaurants and businesses remained open.But these much hailed successes were swiftly overturned at the start of April when the government was caught off-guard by clusters that had been silently growing among migrant foreign workers who live in cramped dormitories that create the perfect conditions for the spread of a highly infectious disease. Low-wage labourers, who come mainly from Bangladesh, India and poorer Asian countries and who did not have the luxury of social distancing, now account for at least 60 per cent of the nation’s infections.As Singapore went about its daily business for the first three months of the year without enduring a strict lockdown, this vital part of its workforce, also operated freely on construction sites and in maintenance and service industry jobs.“Migrant workers have been traditionally the invisible class, 1.4 million of them but they are not apparent in your city,” said Catherine James, executive director of the Singapore-based Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME).  Hundreds of thousands were in “far-flung dorms, where there are still ten to 12 men in a room and that is one too many for comfort,” she said. “For a long time, NGOs have been saying that this is not a good recipe, thinking of other outbreaks like TB. Migrant worker issues aren’t really a top priority. It is traditionally looked at it more from the perspective of maintaining Singapore’s competitiveness and that means keeping costs low.”When the second wave of infections began to rise, the government introduced so-called “circuit breaker” measures, including school and business closures combined with harsh punishments for breaches. On Tuesday, these restrictions were extended by another month to June 1.At least 300,000 foreign labourers must now also remain confined to their dormitories, although about 7,000 essential workers have been moved into alternative lodging at military camps, exhibition centres or floating hotels. The workers do have access to healthcare, confirmed Ms James, although there are concerns about their general well-being and mental health.“Do an aggressive testing and decongest because you need an exit strategy for this confinement, she said. “What we need is decongestion on a war footing.”Roy Ngerng, a Singaporean rights activist, believes the government over-focused on the economy and compromised on its coronavirus strategy in the first few months. The government did not want to shut the economy because first, it would mean lesser profits, but as some of its decision makers said, they wanted to look successful in how they manage the pandemic, and to be first off the bat when the economy recovers.However, despite the surge, deaths remain low at 11 and Singapore is generally still in a favourable position thanks to its small size and strong government and health sector. Outside of the migrant population, who are generally young and healthy and unlikely to need critical care for Covid-19, new cases average 30 a day. “Singapore is not teetering on the brink of disaster, nor do the numbers reflect the actual risk that it faces. The degree of investment in public health and the resources that it has really mitigates the risk. It’s a tragedy but not a disaster,” said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School. “The epidemiological capabilities of the government to be able to track and trace people are still there. And as people get infected in the dorms, the epidemiology is quite easy,” he said. Longer term, Singapore’s slip-up is a reminder of the new reality that even the most ruthlessly planned pandemic strategies can been easily breached by a new wave of Covid-19 cases, particularly if containment measures are lifted too soon.  As the city-state’s experience shows, no country can afford to let its guard down until a vaccine is found. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/12/17/gettyimages-1068007814.jpg","title":"best movies tv shows what to watch lockdown del toro aronofsky","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Guillermo del Toro, Darren Aronofsky, Ari Aster and more list their quarantine streaming habitsA number of top film directors have been revealing on Twitter the TV shows, books and films they are using to pass the time while they stay inside to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.The first to offer suggestions was Pan’s Labyrinth and The\u0026nbspShape of Water director Guillermo del Toro who has been forced to stop filming his upcoming feature Nightmare Alley.His top film pictures included Gustaf Molander’s A Woman’s Face, Ermanno Olmi’s Il Posto, and Celine Sciamma’s Girlhood and Tomboy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe 55-year-old director has also been introducing his kids to “bulletproof stuff” such as Gene Kelly’s Singin’ in the Rain and Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window.The 35 best films to watch while you’re self-isolatingAs for Television, del Toro lists Ozark, Better Call Saul and Chopped as his favourites.Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson replied to del Toro by saying he was enjoying Alex Garland’s new TV show Devs which has just ended its run on Hulu.“It is a compelling thriller built upon some very advanced sciencephilosophy many-worlds theories and the visuals are gorgeous,” he wrote. “Just an amazing show.”Black Swan’s Darren\u0026nbspAronofsky\u0026nbspsaid that he had recently enjoyed\u0026nbspBarton Fink,\u0026nbspAmelie,\u0026nbspRashamon,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTotal Recall.Midsommar’s Ari Aster has rewatched season 3 of The Sopranos.

Ben Chapman finds out whyOn the open plains of Wyoming, in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, something strange began happening last month. Coronavirus itself had barely touched this sparsely populated American state. But the impact of Covid-19 could already be seen.As thousands of aircraft were grounded and billions of citizens ordered to stay home, global demand for oil, the key lubricant of world commerce, had crashed so far and so fast that producers in Wyoming were willing to pay someone 19 cents a barrel to take it off their hands. It was worse than worthless, it had become a burden.A thousand miles northwest, in Alberta, Canada, home to perhaps the world’s single largest deposit of hydrocarbons, a similar story was playing out.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBy Mid-March, if you so desired, you could have purchased one of Canada’s estimated 1.7 trillion barrels of oil, for just $5. In other words, 159 litres of the world’s most vital commodity would set you back less than a pint of beer.Black Monday: Why cheap oil sent world’s stock markets into a tailspinA month later, what may have seemed like mere trivia from obscure corners of the global oil market has rippled across the US, as the price of America\u0027s key benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, plunged as low as minus $40 on Monday - the first time ever it had ben below zero.As supply outstripped demand and storage space filled up at the fastest pace on record, no one wanted to be on the hook for taking delivery of any oil in May. There would be nowhere to put it and no one to buy it off you.Negative prices were to some extent a technical blip caused by the way oil is traded on futures contracts, but experts think the phenomenon is likely to recur next month as the world economy continues to shrink.How the situation develops over the coming months could have lasting impacts on what will soon return to being the most important battle facing humanity – the climate crisis.US and Canadian oil production, which is relatively high-cost compared to production other nations such as Saudi Arabis, looks set to be decimated by the catastrophic slump in oil prices and some experts think it will have a hard time bouncing back. Thousands of jobs will go and many oil wells will cease production. This in turn, the argument goes, will aid the shift towards a lower carbon world.There are other aspects to the crisis\u0026nbspthat could be good for the climate potential changes in our behaviour could stick with us, meaning people work from home more often, travel less and shop locally, for example. Companies that currently fly supplies from all around the world or rely on migrant labour may conclude that building things closer to home is less risky.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhile these may sound like the rosy predictions of green campaigners seeking a silver lining, they are in fact those of Jeff Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street investment bank is not known for environmental utopianism, its analysis is hewn from mountains of data and cold, hard facts.Currie and his team believe that plummeting demand caused by the current crisis could, paradoxically, lead to a massive spike in oil prices next year when the economy comes out of hibernation. They predict that the oil industry won’t be able to keep up, leaving a gap for renewables such as wind and solar to fill.In an eye-catching report, Currie said coronavirus would “permanently alter the energy industry and its geopolitics, restrict demand as economic activity normalises and shift the debate around climate change”.A key reason for this is that the energy source to which the industrialised world has been addicted for more than a century has some major physical constraints. It can’t simply be turned off and on like a tap, Currie tells The Independent.It’s going to require a lot of money to be spent to fix the industry“Oil wells are very different from other industrial processes. They’re organic deposits that require pressure to extract them. When you shut them down you typically do damage to the well,” says Currie.No one has ever attempted to turn off the oil supply so quickly as in the last few weeks. Global demand has cratered by as much as 30 per cent, or 30 million barrels a day, far in excess of anything seen in any previous downturn. Meanwhile, Russia and Saudi Arabia have kept production levels high as they engage in a battle for market share.“Because oil, and energy more broadly, must be contained within infrastructure like pipelines tankers and refineries, you can’t run a surplus indefinitely,“ says Currie. “You can’t just pour the oil outside of the well, it has to go into the system.”Key parts of that system are already full, which means that many producers, particularly those based inland that are reliant on pipelines rather than ships to transport their oil, will have no choice but to shut down, or “shut in”, in industry parlance.Why has the oil price crashed by 30 per cent?Zero-hours contract workers ‘sacked by text’ during Covid-19 outbreakThe world will recover from Covid-19 – it may not from climate changeHedge funds continue to short sell UK companies despite calls to stopHedge fund billionaire vows to punish companies over climate changeShutting in and then opening up again can be prohibitively expensive, which is why producers in Alberta, Wyoming and beyond are willing to sell oil at a loss rather than halt production altogether.Oil is often described as being found in “reservoirs” or “pools”, giving the misleading impression that it sits in cavernous holes underground which simply have to be located and tapped. It’s easy to imagine sticking something akin to a huge straw in the ground and sucking out the oil.In truth oil deposits are often found saturated in tiny holes of porous rocks. Pressure must be applied constantly\u0026nbspto force the oil out of the well. This is easy at the start when pressure can be naturally high, resulting in the kind of gusher often depicted by Hollywood.But, as a well matures, it becomes increasingly tricky – and therefore expensive – to apply the required pressure and extract oil. Starting up the process again, or drilling new wells, adds further cost.“It’s going to require a lot of money to be spent to fix the industry,” says Currie.That money is no longer forthcoming in the quantities that many oil companies have grown used to, meaning only the largest and most efficient companies are likely to survive.If the world is addicted to oil, the oil industry itself is addicted to cash, requiring huge injections of capital to fund exploration and production. But appetite for investing in fossil fuels, particularly in uncertain times, is drying up. With tens of billions of dollars likely to be wiped out as the majority of small, heavily indebted, US oil producers go to the wall, that appetite is likely to reduce even further.Capital markets are more cagey about handing money to oil producers after years of below-par returns. Meanwhile, banks are beginning to cut back financing for oil and gas, and large funds, including Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, have reduced their investment in the sector. The Bank of England is also looking into climate stress testing that could force lenders to get rid of assets at risk as the world shifts to net zero carbon.At the same time, renewables are rapidly becoming a more attractive investment. A wind farm requires a lot less capital than an oil field, and while the returns are less spectacular they are more solid and reliable.Paul Flood, portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management, says companies that produce renewable energy are unique in that they remain stable even through turbulent economic times. That makes them an ideal place for governments to focus what will likely be huge stimulus programmes in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. “It fits very nicely. You’re killing two birds with one stone by providing new sources of renewable energy to decarbonise power, and also providing pension funds with stable revenues.“I think if governments are going to do fiscal spending they’re going to have more credibility directing it towards renewables and climate change initiatives than towards oil and gas.”Despite this apparently gloomy outlook for fossil fuels, not everyone is convinced Covid-19 will be a good thing for the climate. Legal \u0026amp General Investment Management\u0026nbspinvests more than £1 trillion of other people’s money, mostly for the very long term.Nick Stansbury, LGIM’s head of commodity research, believes the current slump in oil prices must be seen on balance as bad for the environment. “From a climate perspective, this is really disappointing,“ he says, “it’s not what we wanted to happen. We did not want oil prices to crash, just as we were beginning to see real momentum behind clean technology and its competitiveness. This has set that back in a very disappointing way.”As consumers, we react pretty quickly to cheaper oil. LGIM’s research shows that after the last significant oil price fall back in 2014-15, Americans started buying less efficient cars within a month. Those decisions have implications for emissions for many years until people trade in their SUVs again.However, Stansbury says American drivers have already gone pretty much “all-in” on gas guzzlers, so the current low prices may not cause them to trade up and get even more inefficient vehicles.There is a broader and more important point to all this: if oil stays around $20 a barrel – the current cost of Brent Crude – that clearly underestimates the actual environmental cost of combusting fossil fuels, says Stansbury. He doesn’t see the kind of drastic shortfall in oil supplies that Jeff Currie at Goldman is predicting and believes American producers can shut down and then ramp up supply again when needed.“There is a higher probability of oil shortages in the next decade as a consequence of this but I think it’s far from certain that that’s what we will get.” US onshore producers already know about huge reserves of oil, it’s just a case of having access to capital so they can go and drill it.What about those much-heralded changes to our behaviour after the pandemic? Martijn Rats, oil strategist at giant US bank\u0026nbspMorgan Stanley, also foresees a long-term shift away from fossil fuels.He highlights three driving forces of this change. First, the current low oil price gives governments a chance to unwind $300bn of subsidies handed out to the fossil fuel industry each year. Second, economic stimulus programmes required to resuscitate activity after the crisis will likely be used to boost investment in clean energy. And, third, we may work from home more and take less flights.“This does not bode well for oil demand in the long term, especially relative to previous long-term expectations,” Rats wrote in a recent note to clients.A report by the AA predicts Covid-19 will cause a permanent reduction in travel in the UK because we’ve quickly adapted to use remote working technology and realised it’s quite effective. The AA even said that a planned £27bn investment in Britain’s roads might not be needed, and perhaps some of the money might be better aimed at improving our broadband internet speeds.Reports of the death of commuting may be greatly exaggerated however, at least for the time being. Nick Stansbury at LGIM thinks it’s too early to tell whether there will be a behavioural shift significant enough to have a real impact on emissions.“Will a lot of us end up working from home a bit more often, gaining a few more hours in our days? We probably will.”But that’s about as much as we can say. Any emissions prevented by fewer journeys to work are likely to be swamped by surging demand for air travel in emerging markets, he says.Jeff Currie at Goldman Sachs believes that higher oil prices after the crisis will hold back demand for flights and make people commute less often.However, given that the world has experienced only a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown conditions, he is sceptical about predictions that the experience will drive long-term changes to our behaviour.“Wait and see,” he says. “We have no idea.”Oil and Gas\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This means producers have access to large, mobile oil tankers and are not reliant on inland storage facilities which are close to full.The falls highlight huge excess supply of oil as demand has fallen by around 30 per cent because of measures taken to tackle Covid-19.While planes have been grounded, large parts of industry have been shut down and millions of people ordered to stay at home, oil producers have continued to pump out crude.Governments in some countries have tentatively begun to loosen lockdown controls but deep uncertainty remains about the global economy\u0027s future.Should environmentalists rejoice or despair over negative oil prices?Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit, warned that negative oil prices indicated a wider economic problems.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Government orders to stay at home mean that most drivers will feel little benefit from falling prices however.Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said the average prices for litres of petrol and diesel should be 98p and 106p. He claimed that the UK\u0027s fuel suppliers had dishonestly held back falls in wholesale costs which took place last month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This means producers have access to large, mobile oil tankers and are not reliant on inland storage facilities which are close to full.The falls highlight huge excess supply of oil as demand has fallen by around 30 per cent because of measures taken to tackle Covid-19.While planes have been grounded, large parts of industry have been shut down and millions of people ordered to stay at home, oil producers have continued to pump out crude.Governments in some countries have tentatively begun to loosen lockdown controls but deep uncertainty remains about the global economy\u0027s future.Should environmentalists rejoice or despair over negative oil prices?Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit, warned that negative oil prices indicated a wider economic problems.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Government orders to stay at home mean that most drivers will feel little benefit from falling prices however.Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said the average prices for litres of petrol and diesel should be 98p and 106p. He claimed that the UK\u0027s fuel suppliers had dishonestly held back falls in wholesale costs which took place last month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know in some cases it’s their only main meal for the day and they’re not able to get much else.How to support our campaign“I am seeing some scared elderly people on their own, so if I speak to them from the pavement, I’m just trying to reassure them and keep their spirits up,” he adds.Briana LeBold, 47, works in fashion production and was furloughed by her company soon after the lockdown began. She has been volunteering as a food delivery cyclist a few days a week.“I decided worrying about work isn’t going to change anything,” she says. “I thought what Made in Hackney and some of the food charities were doing was wonderful, so I just wanted to get involved to support the work.“There isn’t a huge amount of interaction with people, obviously, but they do let us know how much they’re enjoying the meals. Even if it’s just a wave and a ‘hi’ – it’s still really nice to see people and feel like you’re helping in some way.”Tais Lima, a 41-year-old yoga teacher, is volunteering one day a week. “I like getting out on my bike with a sense of purpose,” she says. “There’s a lot of lonely and vulnerable people out there, but it’s rewarding to see they’re getting a meal that changes their day.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered.

Correctly fitted PPE is essential for the protection of staff and patients, and smaller sizes need to be made available urgently.”There have been 49 confirmed deaths of NHS staff since the coronavirus crisis started, but the actual figure is expected to be substantially larger. \u0026nbspRose Gallagher, professional lead for infection prevention and control at the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: “One-size-fits-all protective equipment has been a problem for frontline healthcare workers who have to wear this specialist life-saving equipment for up to 12 hours at a time.“Nurses can find it very difficult to deliver care to patients if this equipment is so uncomfortable it bruises the skin and makes them feel hot and unwell. Nurses wearing PPE need adequate breaks to rest and rehydrate, which requires them to remove and then replace the personal protective equipment.“However, many nurses are expected to work without adequate PPE or to use PPE that has not been produced to meet the required safety standards.\u0026nbsp Nurses are now also being asked to reuse what has up to now been single-use equipment, which is completely unacceptable. Ministers must get a grip on this issue and ensure that no nurse is needlessly put in danger by a lack of masks, eye protection or gowns.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our workers deserve better.”Women struggling to access usual contraception due to Covid-19 crisisA nurse in an intensive care unit in Scotland hit out at the dearth of protective gear that fits women in a message shared by her friend on Twitter earlier in the month.The nurse said: “PPE, which myself and my colleagues are wearing for all of my 12.5 hour shift, with only 2 30 min breaks to eat, drink and pee, plus the time we are working without being paid, is designed and made to fit men.\u0026nbsp“The majority of nurses are female. Our PPE is therefore ‘tightened to fit’ us and believe me it’s uncomfortable enough before that. This is everyday sexism and it’s an absolute horror show already. But females deserve PPE which is designed for smaller faces.”The president of\u0026nbspthe Royal College of Anaesthetists\u0026nbsptold The Independent\u0026nbspdoctors should not be looking after patients amid the\u0026nbspCovid-19\u0026nbspcrisis if they do not have protective gear.A poll of more than 6,000 doctors across the UK by the BMA\u0026nbspfound a substantial proportion are working without PPE, while a study by the RCN\u0026nbspdiscovered half of nurses have felt pressure to work despite not having suitable protective gear.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In the four weeks since lockdown, they have delivered 565 tonnes – a staggering 1.35 million meals.This extraordinary humanitarian effort – carried out with 22 delivery vans manned by a small army of volunteers – comes in the wake of rising food poverty and worrying new research on unemployment. \u0026nbspThe Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex estimated at the weekend that at least 6.5 million jobs could be lost, a fifth of the national total, with the duration of the lockdown being critical as to whether job losses will be short-lived.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt comes on top of a YouGov poll for The Food Foundation revealing that 8 million people in Britain face food insecurity and that 3\u0026nbspmillion have already experienced hunger.As Felix scrambles to respond to the deepening distress with no government support, donations to our campaign, in conjunction with sister title the Evening Standard, are crucial to fund their fast-expanding operation.Today we can report a hugely generous donation from the Garfield Weston Foundation, who agreed to an emergency grant of £500,000 to be shared equally between The Felix Project and FareShare, London’s two biggest food surplus distributors, for their work supporting the most vulnerable families in the wake of the coronavirus.Our campaign raises over £1.5m for the vulnerablePhilippa Charles, director of the Garfield Weston Foundation, said: “Alongside significant grants to the National Emergency Trust among others, our trustees are keen to ensure that those most vulnerable and affected by this crisis receive the immediate support they need. We are delighted to support this partnership between two effective charities with which we have had long-standing relationships.”\u0026nbspAnother donor to our appeal, which is approaching £2m, was the Oso Foundation, whose trustee Karen Jankel, said: “Doing the weekly grocery shop may have its challenges for most of us, but at least we can afford to put food on the table. The ethos behind The Felix Project appeals to us as we hate the idea of waste and so by giving them our donation, we feel as though we’re making a small difference twice over.”On Friday, Felix delivered 16 truckloads of nutritious food to community hubs in eight boroughs –​ Barnet, Enfield, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Islington, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest – and a further 26 truckloads to 75 charities, schools and holiday clubs. All in all, this is the daily equivalent tonnage of three-and-a-half double-decker Routemaster buses.With more borough hubs set to come on stream in the coming days, demand for their services is set to rise yet further.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help here.\u0026nbspFollow this link\u0026nbspto donate to our campaign in London, in partnership with the Evening Standard.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

During a train stop in China early last year, she was given the job of extinguishing her brother’s cigarette.Some analysts said\u0026nbspthat she has the only real characteristic that matters in the North Korean system – being of the “Paektu blood line”, a direct descendent of the Kim dynasty.But North Korea is also a rigid patriarchy, and her gender would most likely rule her out as anything more than a caretaker leader in the event of her brother’s demise.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSimply put, said\u0026nbspLeif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul: “The North Korean system could not continue in its current ideological and institutional form without an adult male descendant of Kim Il-sung.”Kim Jong-un\u0026nbsphas a surviving older brother, who was passed over for consideration when Kim Jong-il decided which of his children to groom as the country’s next leader.Kim Jong-chol is said to have been more keen on music and playing guitar than politics, and is living a quiet life away from the spotlight in North Korea, according to Thae Yong-ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London who defected to the South.He was last spotted in 2011 enjoying an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore, according to South Korean broadcaster KBS. Like his brother, he also studied abroad in Switzerland.According to Kenji Fujimoto, the Japanese man who claims to have been the personal sushi chef for Kim Jong-il, the late North Korean leader\u0026nbspdecided Kim Jong-chol was too “girlish” to lead the country. It would seem to be a long shot for him to return to the fold of public life.The private life of North Korea’s first family is notoriously shrouded in mystery, but we do know that he has been married to former singer and cheerleader Ri Sol-ju since 2009.South Korea’s intelligence services believe the couple have had three children – including a son born in 2010, a daughter born around 2013 and third child in 2017.Bizarrely, perhaps the best insight into the Kim family came from the 2013 visit of US basketball star Dennis Rodman, who described Kim Jong-un as a “good dad” to his then-young daughter Ju Ae.Created with Sketch.Kim Jong-un: Decade in pictures of North Korean leader Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Kim Jong-un rides a horse during

that a form of regency would be required until his eldest son was old enough to take over.Nonetheless, US officials believe that keeping control of the country within the family is still the most likely outcome. Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, Donald Trump’s national security adviser Robert O’Brien said of any succession: “The basic assumption would be maybe it would be someone in the family.”North Korea’s most senior officials have stayed in their jobs through unflinching loyalty to the Kim family, sometimes over multiple generations.In the event that new leadership is required, it is possible that several high-ranking Workers’ Party elders could team up to see the country through any transition.After decades of service including as Kim Jong-un’s first military chief, Choe Ryong-hae rose to be the North’s nominal head of state last year becoming the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly.He and Pak Pong-ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North’s push to introduce more elements of a free market to revive its economy, would be the likely figureheads of any collective leadership.In such a scenario, the former top nuclear envoy Kim Yong-chol and foreign minister Ri Son-gwon could be tasked with handling diplomatic issues including stalled denuclearisation talks with South Korea and Washington, as they played key roles in previous summits with Trump.“Kim now puts his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong in charge of many things, and she is the only sibling and trusted confidante inside his cabinet.

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown. Red for Stop, green for Go, with amber in between.Overzealous cops and councils are being reined in. ­Common sense is taking over. Families can now attend funerals.We might be able to say goodbye to dying ­relatives. Parks will reopen to the ­public. Benches have been deemed safe to sit on.So how about allowing non-contact sporting activities that boost both physical and mental health Swimming pools are surely safe.

On each phone there is an app that reports back to the authorities on the users’ health and online activities.Nor is there any escape in the home. The very concept of privacy barely exists when the state can use sophisticated technology to keep watch on our behaviour.This vision sounds like a nightmare, but it could become all too real thanks to the coronavirus.In its fallout, Covid- may end up causing as much damage to our essential freedoms as to our health - with the new menace of Big Brother on its way.Already the current emergency has led to the first comprehensive lockdown in British history.Evenit has been necessary to slow the spread of the virus, it is nevertheless a draconian measure that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago.Effectively the entire public has been placed under house arrest.Normal le has been brought juddering to a halt, while the police have been given unprecedented powers to enforce the quarantine.Even sitting for too long on a park bench or taking a leisurely drive have become offences against the state.With heroic stoicism, the vast majority of people have accepted this policy, seeing it as the only realistic means to protect the NHS and lessen the transmission of coronavirus.They hope that once the worst of the crisis has passed, there will be ato the Britain that they love, where inidual rights are respected and the power of the state is limited.Above all, this is my deepest wish too - though the chances look slim.One of the reasons why I, as an Irishman, admire this country so much is because of the British tradition of liberty, reflected in Magna Carta, parliamentary democracy and the defeat of Nazi tyranny.Unfortunately, even when the current lockdown is lted, it is possible that heavy-handed control by the state will remain.Quarantine may be temporary, but authoritarianism could be permanent.This is because officialdom, shaken by the unexpected scale of the coronavirus crisis, will be determined to prevent its resurgence by any means necessary.That will involve far more than just the maintenance of social distancing and the wearing of face masks.An arsenal of other measures could be deployed in the fight.One will be the reintroduction of curfews at the first sign of any new flare up in cases.If there is such a setback, the mood of the authorities will be even more intolerant towards any breaches. Fines will be heavier, jail terms longer.The skies will be filled with the sound of helicopters and the sight of drones as police — or even the Army — embark on ruthless enforcement.Another change is likely to be the advent of biometric identity cards, backed up by a comprehensive database of the entire population.Such a system has long been the dream of bureaucrats in Whitehall, and the aftermath of the crisis provides the perfect excuse for its imposition.Its appeal is all the greater because the latest type of cards operate with biotechnology that scans eyes and fingerprints.Only last year, the European Union passed a regulation requiring all national identity card systems on the continent to comply with new biometric standards.The British state will not stop there in its new crusade.In the name of health protection, mobile phone companies could be required to share data on their clients.According to the New Statesman, British Telecom, which owns the EE network, is already “in talks with the Government about handing over phone location and usage data” for the purpose of monitoring adherence to the lockdown.Similarly, tracking apps on devices could also be made obligatory so that the Government will be able to trace the contacts of anyone infected and ensure compliance with quarantine rules.Just as some criminals on release have to wear electronic tags, anyone who has tested positive for the virus may be ordered to wear a medical wristband even when self-isolation is over.Alternatively, those who test negative could be given immunity certicates.These initiatives will be accompanied by a political drive to reinforce support for the state, as happens in wartime.In a distinctly un-British way, people will be encouraged to snitch on those who fail to abide by the rules.Challenges to ruling orthodoxy will be seen as a form of subversion.If that sounds far-fetched, consider how laws to tackle discrimination or terrorism are now used to uphold fashionable ideology, as highlighted in the outrageous recent case where Lincolnshire businessman Harry Miller was questioned by police for allegedly sending a “transphobic” tweet.In the new Britain scarred by corona, the whole relationship between the state and the public will be inverted.The Government is meant to be accountable to the people.But, burdened with ID cards, curfews and tracking apps, the people will be accountable to the Government.There is an echo here of the George Orwell’s novel , which painted a terrying picture of Britain under totalitarian rule.In Orwell’s society gripped by permanent crisis, the citizenry were monitored day and night by the state.The propaganda and all-seeing eye of Big Brother could never be avoided, “always watching and the voice enveloping you, asleep or awake, indoors or outdoors, in the bath or in bed.In the present global crisis, many look to the experience of Asia, which has had far lower Covid death rates than the West.But that is a dangerous stance. First it ignores the fundamental point that China is responsible for the spread of this disease through its cover-up, persecution and lies.The country should be in the dock, not garnered with praise.Second it glosses over the oppressive nature of many of these Asian regimes, particularly that run by the tyrannical Chinese communist party.China has eagerly embraced new technology, like tracking devices, facial recognition cameras, eye-scanning security barriers and online data gathering, precisely because they drastically enhance the power of the state machine.Indeed, the country likes to boast that it is building the “world’s largest camera surveillance network”.As an example, in Guangzhou province, the commercial hub of southern China, tablets have been recently installed on buses to promote safety.Passengers are expected to lean their foreheads close to the tablet so that their photos and temperatures can be taken.China is also establishing a sinister “social credit system”, where behaviour is monitored to assess a citizen’s trustworthiness.Those given high ratings by the state can receive rewards like employment offers, shorter waiting times in hospitals and discounts at hotels.It is a recipe for bureaucratic despotism and political infantilisation.Other Asian nations, while nothing like as cruel as China, are also using technology as a tool to corral their public.Hong Kong has introduced mandatory wristbands for those in quarantine so they can be tracked.Taiwan has a monitoring system known as “the electronic fence” where those who are meant to be in isolation will be visited by the authoritiesthey turn off their mobiles.In South Korea, the government gathers huge amounts of data from phone records, CCTV images, and credit cards to help track citizens during the Covid crisis, while in Singapore, phone users are encouraged to download the “TraceTogether” app.This keeps a record of all the other numbers that have been in close proximity to the smartphone, making it easier to trace anyone who might have been near the owner in the event of a positive Covid-test.Not all of these developments are bad, provided they are genuinely used as weapons against disease rather than vehicles for the expansion of state power.But we have seen since   how the excuse of security can be used as a cover for bullying by the authorities, with the result that international air travel is often a miserable experience.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.We should not allow the same to happen on a national scale in the wake of the pandemic.As the great author C.S.Lewis wrote: “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The former diplomat - who has served in both Seoul and Beijing - addedKim was to die his other elder brother Kim Jong-chul may step forward.He said: The brother could be an optionhe is still around.Jong-chul is something of a playboy and has been reportedly been seen in the West attending rock concerts.Mr Hoare added:Whatever happens I dont think you can expect any kind of uprising as the elite have too much to lose.They knowthey are ided they will be vulnerable  - particularly from South Korea.David Maxwell, of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank who has two decades of military service in Asia, warns nothing is straight forward when it comes to North Korea.“It is unknown whether Kim Jong-un has designated a successor,” he told the Military Times.We can speculate that perhaps his sister has been designated as his successor based on her recent promotion and the fact she has begun making official statements in her name beginning last month.Maxwell warned: “Units of the North Korean People’s Army are going to compete for resources and survival. This will lead to internal conflict among units and could escalate to widespread civil war.We can expect large numbers of the military to resist any and all outside foreign intervention to include from South Korea.Without a designated heir there will be “chaos, human suffering, instability,” added  retired South Korean Lt. Gen.

Its not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad.Executive Director Ian Murray said: Although the Duke and Duchess say they support a free press and all it stands for there is no escaping their actions here amount to censorship and they are setting an unfortunate example.Although the couple may no longer style themselves as working royals, they continue to be high-profile public figures and indeed have made plain their intention to continue to do so.By appearing to dictate which media they will work with and which they will ignore they, no doubt unintentionally, give succour to the rich and powerful everywhere to use their example as an excuse to attack the media when it suits them.The truth is that Harry and Meghan have enjoyed and continue to enjoy a huge amount of positive coverage for themselves and their causes, much of it carried in the very titles they are now targeting.They may have been stung by some of the coverage they have not liked, they may disagree strongly with some elements of that coverage and can of course take action to answer any criticism they consider unfair or inaccurate through several channels.But the answer should never be to attempt to shun inidual titles and their millions of readers.But it cant be based on a lie.They also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media.The letter also added the couple had watched people they know - as well as complete strangers - have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue.The couple have stepped back from their royal duties and are living in Calornia.This week, they were pictured holding hands in loved-up display as they delivered food to LA locals in need during the coronavirus crisis.Meghan and Harry donned face masks as they delivered free meals in West Hollywood for charity Project Angel Food around their new city.Prior to stepping down from the royal family, Meghan and Harry launched an attack on the UKs newspapers in a dedicated media section on their new website Sussexroyal.The couple, who said they will be adopting a revised media approach from the spring, criticised Britains royal correspondents and said they would no longer participate in the royal rota system which has been used by Buckingham Palace for decades.Meghan is involved in legal action against Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Mail On Sunday and MailOnline, over an article which reproduced parts of the handwritten letter sent to Thomas Markle, , in August .Harry described the media as a powerful force in an emotional speech just a day after saying he and his we would be stepping back from royal duties.The duke has had a complicated and dficult relationship with the press through the years. His dislike of the media has seemingly intensied since the birth of his son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor last year.Harry was  when his mum, Princess Diana was killed in a crash after her car, driven at speed, was chased through the streets of Paris by the paparazzi.Soon after he began dating Meghan, Harry attacked the media over its abuse and harassment of his then girlfriend, with Kensington Palace warning on his behalf: This is not a game - it is her le.As The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now settle into the next chapter of their lives and no longer receive any publicly funded support, we are writing to set a new media relations policy, specically as it pertains to your organisation.Like you, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracy - particularly in moments of crisis.At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for whats right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account.It has been said that journalisms first obligation is to the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agree wholeheartedly.It is gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media, over many years, has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or print - even when they know it to be distorted, , or invasive beyond reason.When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in this much-needed industry is degraded. There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know - as well as complete strangers - have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue.With that said, please note that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet.There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.This is also a policy being instated for their communications team, in order to protect that team from the side of the industry that readers never see. This policy is not about avoiding criticism.Its not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad.But it cant be based on a lie. They also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to working with journalists and media organisations all over the world, engaging with grassroots media, regional and local media, and young, up-and-coming journalists, to spotlight issues and causes that so desperately need acknowledging.And they look forward to doing whatever they can to help further opportunities for more erse and underrepresented voices, who are needed now more than ever.What they wont do is offer themselves up as currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion.

I attacked the nearest from behind. I fired two bursts...I then saw the enemy aircraft fall out of formation and crash to the ground.I was then attacked from behind and forced down.After ing to Britain his second enemy kill came on June  when he shot down another Messerschmidt  over Abbeville, France.On July  over Dover he destroyed a Heinkel bomber which crashed in the sea with the loss of three of the crew.During the Battle of Britain Sq Ldr Hart was required to fly five sorties in a single day.He claimed a fourth kill - another Me  - on August  over Margate and then survived another crash landing at Foulness, Essex.On August  he gained ace status with a fth enemy plane destroyed followed by a sixth in November .He then joined No.  Squadron and served in the Middle East.

But it has been decided to go ahead with the ceremony to officially introduce new peers to the upper house despite the nation being in lockdown. Baron Stephen Greenhalgh, a longtime ally of the Prime Minister who served as his deputy mayor for Policing, will take his seat today. And Lord Grimstone of Boscobel, the former chairman of Barclays Bank will join him on the red benches. Boris Johnson has already appointed Lord Grimstone as an Investment Minister, despite his not yet having taken his seat.One Peer told the Mirror: “It appears to be do as we say not as we do. You really couldnapost make this soap opera up. “The sooner we are abolished the better” It’s expected the usual ceremony, which involves dozens of peers, House officials, ermine robes and tri-corn hats may be scaled down in today’s ceremony.

Obviously those who are about to sit examinations that decision has been made for them in terms of estimated grades. “But those who are preparing for examinations next year I think possibly need to repeat the year, and perhaps others as well. But that decision needs to be made by the Department [of Education].” He added: “They might have lost out so much by this that they need to repeat the whole year.” “It can be managedthere’s sufficient time to do that. But certainlyI was a parent of a child in year  or year , I’d want them to have the same opportunities as other children andthey’ve lost out then I think it’s up to schools and up to government to make sure they are given that opportunity.” Sir Michael said he could see schools opening up in June “as long as there is plenty of planning.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus uks decision not join","story":"NewsCoronavirus: UKs decision not to join EU wide PPE buying scheme was politicalThe claim by the Foreign Offices top civil servant flies in the face of claims by Downing Street that the UK didnt take part because of missed communicationsShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsIt comes as the UK experiences PPE shortages \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Foreign Office Permanent Under Secretary Sir Simon McDonald told the Foreign Affairs committee that ministers were briefed about opportunities but decided not to take part. But just hours later the Health Secretary hit back.He said: As far as Iaposm aware there was no political decision not to participate in that scheme. It isnapost clear at the moment who is correct. The EU scheme, which is organised by the European Commission, has been organised in several rounds and has covered ventilators and PPE. Initially Sir Simon told MPs on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee that it was because Britain had left the EU.But challenged by Labour MP Chris Bryant that the UK was still eligible to take part, Sir Simon said: All I can say is that we have not taken part.Asked about the process of making that decision Sir Simon said: It was a political decision Ministers were briefed on what was available, what was on offer by the mission in Brussels and the decision is known. Previously the UK Government had claimed there was absolutely no ideology and it had missed an email invitation from the EU to join the scheme. In mid-March the European Commission confirmed Britain was still eligible to participate in these joint procedures despite formally leaving the EU on  January. On March , the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman confirmed that they had missed participating because of a missed communication.He added that the government would consider doing so in future rounds and stressed that there was no blame attached here.Later that week Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said that the scheme didnapost have anything the NHS needed in it despite it covering ventilators, PPE, and testing equipment. Speaking on Andrew Marr on March  he said:“There was some confusion over our involvement in that scheme. “But I’ve talked to senior figures in the NHS and they’ve reassured me that there is nothing that we can’t do as an independent nation that being part of that scheme would have allowed us to do.”Asked whether an email was received by the government, he said: “There was some communication confusion, I don’t know all the details of that, but I do know having talked to senior figures in the NHS that there’s nothing that participating in that scheme would have allowed us to do that we have not been able to do ourselves.”Alyn Smith MP, the SNP’s Shadow Foreign Affairs spokesperson, said: “The revelation that this was a ‘political decision’ by the UK government, rather than a logistical error, that prevented the UK from securing vital PPE supplies for our frontline staff tackling the coronavirus pandemic is damning. “It’s clear that UK government ministers were briefed about the Europe-wide scheme but chose to reject vital protective equipment due to its narrow Brexit ideology. “Quite simply, it would be unacceptableanyone has decided to put politics before the urgent need to save people’s lives. “Governments across the UK have a duty to work together and with international partners to tackle the pandemic effectively. The UK government must now urgently explain why it took a political decision to reject vital PPE supplies.” Best for Britain CEO Naomi Smith slammed the decision."},{"url":null,"title":"ministers accused picking choosing who","story":"NewsMinisters accused of picking and choosing WHO coronavirus advice in Football match rowLiverpool Mayor Steve Rotheram has hit back at the governments claims it followed the scientic advice over letting a Champions League match between Liverpool and Athletico Madrid go ahead, despite warnings that events could be spreading the virusShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  APR Updated:,  APR News \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Government ministers have come under increasing fire for allowing Liverpoolaposs match against Athletico Madrid to go ahead, despite warnings that events could be spreading the virus. The government faced similar criticism over the decisions to let the Cheltenham Festival go ahead.Yesterday deputy chief scientic adviser Professor Dame Angela McLean said it was an interesting hypothesis that Liverpool hosting the football match could have spread coronavirus.But today Mr Rotheram hit out at the governmentaposs insistence that it has followed the scientic advice saying that they seemed to pick and choose when to take advice from WHO. In a joint online press conference with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, he said the World Health Organisationaposs advice at the time was that fans should not be travelling to attend a football match. He added: If we had locked down sooner we would have been out of this now or on the downward trajectory.The Labour politician blamed the blames the governmentaposs flawed herd immunity strategy and said their reluctance to bring in a lockdown was wrong.It came after Professor McLean downplayed the signicance of the match. She said: The question youaposve raised has to be put into context of the general policy at the time. When normal le was under way going to a football match was not a particularly large extra risk, she said. However, when you get to the situation of our strange lives as we live them now where we spend all our time basically at home, of course you wouldnapost add on an extra risk of lots and lots of people going off to the same place at the same time, she continued. I think it will be very interesting to see in the future when all the science is done what relationship there is between the virus that has circulated in Liverpool and the virus that has circulated in Spain. Thataposs certainly an interesting hypothesis you raise there. The Chancellor defended the Government for not having introduced a ban on large sporting events sooner.  At every stage in this crisis weaposve been guided by the scientic advice and have been making the right decision at the right time, Mr Sunak said. This is an unprecedented situation weaposre all dealing with, Iaposm sure there are all things that we will learn from this. Earlier today Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has defended the decision to argue the Cheltenham Festival should have gone ahead. The four-day Festival saw , people gather in close proximity just ten days before lockdown began. Appearing on Good Morning Britain, Dowden was accused by presenter Piers Morgan of actively encouraging people to attend the likes of the Cheltenham and the Liverpool versus Atletico Madrid football match after the Government decided not to ban major events until late March. Mr Dowden said: The scientic evidence we were being given was that, at a mass gathering, the threat at a mass gathering relates to the people who immediately surround you - the people in front of you and behind you.

Measures were taken in the chamber to ensure MPs sat at least two metres apart, following social distancing advice, as they sat briefly to debate ways to take debates online. The aposprayer cardsapos in the backs of the Commons green benches were replaced with red crosses and green ticks, indicating where it was OK for an MP to sit. Every other bench was sealed off, and yellow and black tape placed on the floor to indicate the six foot window betwee But Tory Sir Desmond Swayne said “extraordinary” regulations had been placed on the public - and complained MPs had not had chance to debate them. And he raised concerns the new system could prevent MPs from taking part in debatesthere were too many to safely sit in the chamber or take part online. The Brexit-backing backbencher said it would be “outrageous”MPs were excluded from debates. He added: This is the precedent that weaposre now setting and it would be outrageousmembers elected to this House were unable to come and bring their concerns to this chamber because there were already a sufficient number of members within it. He added: “When we come to debate, which I hope we shall, the extraordinary regulations that have been imposed on our citizens, and all the anomalies and indeed absurdities that are in them, let alone when we get to debate when we lt those regulations, just letaposs come to the debate on the actual imposition of those regulations.” Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs no business would be brought before the house next week that was likely to be controversial or require a vote.It’s thought the government are drawing up plans to temporarily allow MPs to vote remotely to be presented in in the coming days. DUP MP Ian Paisley asked: “Is he guaranteeing nothing to do with extending of abortion in Northern Ireland will be brought to the house during this crisis period ” Mr Rees-Mogg said he was looking to have remote voting beyond next week, but no controversial matters would be debated before that was in place. DUP MP Jim Shannon also rose to his feet to ask the government to commit to shelving any changes to abortion in Northern Ireland.  What I need Mr Speaker from the leader of the house is an assurance on the record that under no circumstances will any member of this house be disenfranchised and prevented from voting against abortion. Mr Rees-Mogg said: Votes on abortion have always been free votes and it would be astonishingthat were to change. He repeated his assurance that there would be no controversial business brought next week.

Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said there was #xCrelatively low confidence#xD that a shipment of , surgical gowns which had been due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday would make its way into the country on Monday. The lack of PPE remains a dominant issue for NHS staff, as hospitals are forced into workarounds, including washing equipment and asking workers to accept wearing less protective gear. The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across healthcare, has also reacted angrily to Government promises of more PPE, saying delays on the shipment from Turkey #xCmakes a dficult situation worse#xD. Its chief executive, Niall Dickson, said: #xCIt would have been better had the Government not made the announcement in the first place#xD and said staff would need to make their own assessment over whether they felt safe with the PPE currently on offer. Mr Hopson told Radio #xs Today programme that it was wrong to focus on inidual consignments of PPE because #xCbitter experience over the last few weeks#xD has shown they cannot be relied upon, with some boxes containing the wrong items and thousands of pieces missing. #xCSo rather than being marched up to the top of the hill and being marched back down again, let#xs just focus on what we know we can be certain of,#xD he said. #xCLet#xs not focus on inidual consignments, let#xs try and get as quickly as possible to a sustainable supply of these gowns. #xCThere#xs no doubt that at the moment, we have now got trusts that have definitely got shortages of gowns.#xD Mr Hopson said trusts were reserving the stock of fluid-resistant gowns they do have for areas of high clinical risk, such as intensive care units, and using workarounds in other areas. #xCThere#xs one trust that#xs basically discovered thatyou launder those gowns at  degrees ... there#xs probably up to three times that you can do that, and the gowns appear to still be fully fluid-repellent,#xD he said.

The NASUWT would not expect teachers to be asked to undertake cleaning tasks or to be expected to undertake them to the necessary standards to protect the health of pupils and the workforce, Dr Roach said. The Department for Education has previously said that teachers do not need PPE and should instead focus on social distancing, handwashing, hygiene measures and cleaning surfaces to stop the spread of infection.  It is understood that children couldto school in as soon as three weeks, under new plans to ease the coronavirus lockdown.Under the proposals pupils from certain age groups will have lessons during selective days of the week or every other week to ensure they practise social distancing. Primary schools would resume lessons first and students from Years  and  who are due to sit their GCSEs and A-levels next year will alsoto the classroom.

Jackie Schneider, who teaches music at a primary school in the borough of Merton in London, said resuming lessons too soon could undo all the good work achieved during the lockdown.

Barbara Newell was married to Allan for  years and spent  of those as foster carers.The -year-old died from lung disease a month before her Allan, , died of coronavirus, their heartbroken daughter said.The couple, who had three children, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, had won an award for their dedicated service to foster care, which saw them take in in more than  youngsters and provide a safe home for severely disabled children. Tragically Barbara died on March  after having terminal pulmonary fibrosis since . Allan had lovingly cared for her as her as her condition deteriorated over the past  months, despite suffering from diabetes and prostate cancer himself. He was rushed to hospital when he collapsed at home just three weeks after Barbara had died. Heartbreakingly, he was diagnosed with covid- and died in hospital on April . Their daughter Jude Greaves-Newall, , herself an advanced clinical AE practitioner, spoke of her pain at not being able to visit her ill father.  She said: We couldnapost be there for him, we couldnapost see him, we couldnapost visit him. The last time I saw him, he was in the back of the ambulance saying aposIaposll be back in an hourapos. We are just a bit lost. As a family, we come together to hold each other and we talk to each other. We canapost do that now, we are all in these dferent places and we canapost come together and look after each other.

Jude added: We canapost grieve properly, despite everybodyaposs best efforts to make sure you can, you canapost reallyyou canapost come together with your family and canapost look after each other. You donapost realise how much you miss someone being able to put their arms around you. Jude and her husband Vince will now take care of their severely disabled -year-old foster sister, who had been with her parents since she was just two. Jude, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, added: They were great parents.  I would not have been able to become a nurse without them. They opened their home for lots and lots of people. They were just kind people. It is heartbreaking to lose them both so close together. My mum always said she wished she had written all the children down that she fostered. She lost count in the end, but they took in more than  children over the years. They dedicated their whole lives to it. My dad worked for many years, but their main roles were as foster carers. Last year, they won an award at the Bradford Safeguarding Childrenaposs Boardaposs Safeguarding Champions Awards. Their testimonial and story, which brought some of those in attendance to tears, said: They have looked after hundreds of children over the years and have treated each one of them asthey were their own. Barbara and Allan provide a happy, warm and stable environment for the children they look after, and have acted as advocates where necessary.

But Edward VII, who reigned from  to , was born in November - which obviously isnapost the best time of year for a huge outdoor celebration.  So instead, he moved Trooping of the Colour to May or June because there was less chance of it being cold and drizzly on the big day.

There isnapost a set date for the Queenaposs official birthday, and it is instead typically held on the second Saturday of June.

Robin Shattock of Imperial College says another wave of the disease is likely when social distancing restrictions are lted. But he warned another wave may not follow the pattern we have seen so far, which could strain the NHS even further. Professor Shattock told  The Times : The real big danger iswe see the kind of number of cases of Covid- that we’re seeing now next winter — and we also have a seasonal flu. That could be a double whammy for the health service. For the latest coronavirus updates, follow our live blog here. The expert did however say there is no guarantee any second wave of Covid- would happen during the winter. We don’t know that there’s any seasonality about this virus, he added. But you can imagine that when we start to get back to normal le, possibly over the summer, that cases will ramp up again. Some scientists have suggested coronavirus could follow a similar pattern to the deadly Spanish flu, which swept the globe in three waves, claiming about  millions lives. But Prof Shattock, who is working on developing a coronavirus vaccine, said there is currently nothing to suggest how deadly a second wave could be. He said: I don’t think there’s any evidence that a second wave of coronavirus would be any worse than this current wave, that’s certainly not something that people are concerned about.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly said he is cautious about lting lockdown measures too early over fears it could spark a second wave of the virus. A government source told the Times: “The idea that we will be rushing to lt measures is a non-starter. “If the transmission rate rises signicantly we will have to do a harder lockdown again.” But others in government are reportedly keen to end the lockdown sooner to avoid permanent damage to the economy. A Treasury assessment reportedly predicts economic recovery from  coronavirus  could take “years”. And it’s been reported  Michael Gove  and  Rishi Sunak  are keen to ease restrictions and minimise the risk to businesses. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the BBC: What Iaposm being told and what the PM has said consistently through this is that we will base our actions on the facts and the clinical evidence.

Stacey Adams woke up with a searing pain and found Krys Ritson hovering over her with his fist clenched. The -year-old from Workington, Cumbria, thought she was going to die. Ritson starting screaming at Stacey - but calling her by his exaposs name. She was only saved after neighbouraposs heard the ordeal and called police. She was rushed to hospital where she underwent surgery and police later revealed Ritsonaposs dark past of violence to Stacey.Here, Stacey shares her ordeal... Lying on the sofa in my pyjamas, I picked up my phone and logged onto Facebook for my morning nosey. Just then, a friend request popped up.Krys Ritson. Seeing his name made me smile and my thoughts flashed back to when we were teenage sweethearts. I was  when I’d met Krys, then . Every time he knocked at my door to askI wanted to hang out, I got butterflies. He was gorgeous, had a great sense of humour, and though we were young, there was an undeniable spark between us. We had quickly become an item and spent four amazing months together, before Krys had moved out of the village where we lived. I’d been so sad to see him go, so I’d thrown myself into studying for my school exams, in an effort to repair the heartbreak. Now,  years later, I had moved to the area where he lived, but I’d never expected him to get in touch. I tapped the ‘accept’ button and didn’t have to wait long before a message appeared. Hello beautul, how you keeping  How’s things  As though no time had passed, Krys was back in my le and the conversation flowed between us.Now he was older, he was even more of a charmer and made me feel comfortable enough to talk to him about anything.Three months later, I was on a night out with the girls. After a few drinks I got out my phone and sent a message to Krys.Want to come and meet me  When he arrived, I went outside to see him. ‘It’s been so long,’ I said, hugging him. ‘You look great,’ he said. I noticed he was shaking. ‘Are you nervous ’ I asked. ‘Yes, I’ve wanted you all my le Stacey,’ he said. ‘I can’t believe you wanted to meet me.’ ‘Of course,’ I smiled. We chatted for a bit, then he came into the pub to meet my friends. He began to relax and soon his banter had all the girls laughing.  After that, we picked up exactly where we’d left off all those years ago. We started spending all our spare time together, going on long walks, having a laugh while bowling and enjoying evenings at the pub. Soon we decided to make it official and Krys was the perfect boyfriend. We never argued or disagreed about anything. One day, he sat on the end of my bed, took my hands in his, and looked me in the eyes. ‘I love you more than you will ever know, baby,’ he said. It was such early days and though I didn’t say it out loud, I was falling for him too. Already I could picture us having a future together. Even on bad days, it was always Krys that picked me up. I was feeling down in the dumps, when I opened the front door to find Krys standing there clutching an enormous bouquet of flowers. ‘These are to cheer you up princess, to show how much I love you,’ he said. ‘They’re beautul, thank you so much,’ I beamed. ‘I’m so glad we found each other after all these years,’ he said. ‘I feel like the luckiest man alive.’ Then Krys got some terrible news. Two of his friends had been killed in a car crash. I did my best to comfort him, but he wasn’t coping very well and started taking Valium to help him sleep. My cheery, loving Krys disappeared and he became gloomy and low. I felt sorry for him and hoped that in time, he would get through this rough patch.  Two weeks later, he was getting ready to go out. ‘You deserve a night out with the lads,’ I said. Krys grabbed his wallet and gave me a kiss. ‘I’ll see you later princess,’ he said. ‘I love you all the world.’ ‘Love you too, I’ll leave the door unlocked for you,’ I replied. Once he’d gone, I pulled on my pyjamas and got into bed. I’d been craving an early night and it wasn’t long before I drted off to sleep… THWACK. I woke up with a searing pain rippling through my face. My eyes sprung open to see Krys looming over me, his fist clenched. He’d punched me in the nose and I was pretty sure it was broken.  ‘What are you doing ’ I screamed. ‘Lisa*, you fat s**t,’ he shouted. ‘It’s your fault, you’ve split me and Stacey up.’ ‘What are you talking about ’ I said. ‘I am Stacey, Lisa is your ex.’ ‘Go get my cigarettes!’ he yelled. Dazed and very confused, I put a hand to my nose and felt warm blood trickle over my hand. As I tried to get up, Krys clambered on top of me. But I managed to knee him in the groin and push him off. Stumbling out of the bedroom, I gaped at my boyfriend and wondered where my perfect man had gone. In his place was a monster. His eyes looked black, as though he were possessed. Before I could escape, he grabbed me and thrust me hard against the upstairs bannister. As he did, I hit my head and felt a crack in my chest. This is it, he’s going to kill me, I thought.  He was still yelling and calling me Lisa as I collapsed to the floor in a heap and curled up to try and protect myself. Seconds later, he went to lie on the bed and I took my chance to crawl into another bedroom, to get away from him. What felt like a letime later, I heard a thudding on the front door. ‘Open up, it’s the police,’ a voice called. Relief flooded through me but I daren’t move. Moments later, I heard the police kick the door down before rushing inside. I was saved. The police took one look at the state of me and called for an ambulance. They explained a neighbour had heard our shouting and called . Several officers spoke to Krys in the bedroom before leading him away in handcuffs. As I was taken to the ambulance, I just couldn’t get my head around how and why he had flipped. He’d never so much as raised his voice before.  At hospital, I was examined and told I had a broken nose, fractured cheekbone and eye socket, and six broken ribs. I was booked in for surgery to fix my face and was allowed home to rest in the meantime. Later, the police came to speak to me again and dropped a bombshell. Krys had a record for domestic violence on previous partners. I was stunned. I’d never thought of him as anything other than a complete softie. The police also told me Krys had claimed he thought he’d hit his ex-girlfriend Lisa and not me. It was only when they showed him photos of me and my injuries that he accepted he’d attacked me, his own girlfriend.  None of it made sense. I just wanted my old boyfriend back, the one who made me feel like a million dollars. In time, Krys Ritson, then , of Whitehaven, appeared at Carlisle Crown Court and admitted causing me grievous bodily harm, as well as damaging another former partneraposs phone and fraudulently using her bank card. The court heard his offending was fuelled by drug abuse, that he had an “appalling” criminal record, particularly for violence, and that a number of these offences were committed in a domestic context.  He was sentenced to  months in prison. I knew he was where he belonged, but I couldn’t help feeling heartbroken. Now, I still can’t believe what he did. I loved Krys with all my heart, but his abuse has left me a shell of my former self and I find it hard to trust anyone. If I’d have known he had a history of violence, I would never have accepted him on Facebook that day. I also wish I’d known about Clare’s Law, so I could have used the scheme to check his criminal history. I have since used it on my new partner who thankfully has nothing to hide.

The McDonaldaposs cheese melt dippers joined the menu for Christmas, but were removed early this year with Mcdonaldaposs saying due to kitchen space and specialist equipment requirements, weaposre limited in the number of food items weaposre able to offer at any one time. So, thankfully Rees Edwards-Caulier and his girlfriend Kristy shared their recipe to TikTok - and it only requires four ingredients. You will need a Babybel, breadcrumbs, flour and an egg. Method Start by whisking an egg in a bowl. Grab your Babybel and roll it in flour - Kristy used self-raising, but plain flour works just as good. Then, roll the floured Babybel in the egg.  Pour out some of your bread crumbs onto a plate and coat the entire Babybel in the crumbs. Heat some oil in a frying pan- so that the oil coats the Babybel completely. And, using a spatula, place your Babybel into the oil.  Once itaposs golden brown on both sides, youaposre good to go! Serve with a tangy tomato dip like McDonaldaposs or whatever tickles your tastebuds. The video has received , likes and , comments of people praising their idea.  In the first video the pair posted about their Babybel cheese dippers, one person said: Looks delicious. Another person said: Dayum these look good. And a third said: Omg well done.

That means thousands of holidays are at risk with the country also still in coronavirus lockdown.Tourism in Spain is big business with  million Brits alone estimated to visit every year. But it could be  when the beaches and bars reopen, sun-seekers have been warned. But the Minister of Labour Yolanda Diaz said the Covid- de-escalation period will likely be done in two phases – and the holiday industry will not be prioritised. She said officials are working on the next phase of the State of Emergency which will run until at least April . It is likely restrictions will be extended past the May th cut off, and Ms Diaz said the government is working on two separate plans. She explained: We are working on two phases for de-escalation, one for the summer and another for the end of the year. Ms Diaz confirmed the process of reincorporating workers will be gradual and that the first timescale sees action in June. Large companies and banks in Spain have already confirmed that theto work for Spanish people will be gradual.  The second stage of the plan will last until the end of the year and will likely affect tourism, culture and leisure as well as air and sea navigation.

Although Bary is yet to be formally identied by authorities, Jean-Charles Brisard, a French international consultant and expert on terrorism appeared to confirm that Bary is one of the arrested suspects.He said: According to our information, it is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, son of Adel Abdel Bari, involved in the attacks against the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in . It is not immediately clear how long Bary had been in Spain but it is understood he entered from north Africa. Bary, , left the UK in  to join the ranks of the so-called Islamic State in Syria as a foot soldier.In , a sickening image emerged on Twitter of him posing with a severed head.Underneath, the depraved Londoner wrote: “Chillin with my other homie, or whats left of him.” He added: “Its beautul whenever you see Allahs laws being implemented.” But by  it was reported that Bary, who had once been a budding rapper, was on the run after falling out with ISIS and may have hiding out in Turkey.At the time it was believed he was amongst  ‘disillusioned Westerners’ who had fled the murderous organisation. He managed to escape by disguising himself as a refugee and crossing the border during the chaos when ISIS retreated from Tal Abyad, reports suggest.He was brought up in Maida Vale, west London, and his father was believed to have had close connections with  Osama bin Laden.Bary is the son of Adel Abdul Bary - an Egyptian who recently admitted playing a role in the deadly bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.  Before he became radicalised he was an aspiring musician and his tracks were even played on BBC Radio . However once ISIS took hold he renounced his musical ambitions for Allah, he has previously said.

Lionel Vytialingam was buying food when he heard car horns and saw a small terried dog weaving in and out of traffic in Ipoh, Malaysia. He jumped in his car and followed the abandoned dog until he was able to get close enough to approach the animal. Lionel saw the dog had a soggy note attached to its collar with a rubber band, but didnapost try to retrieve it until he had gained its trust. After about  minutes, the dog plucked up the courage to approach him and Lionel carefully removed the note, while holding on to her apossticky knots of furapos, hoping it contained the owneraposs contact details or an address. Instead, he found a heartbreaking message which read: Woof! Hi! My name is Siggy and Iaposm the most loving and attentive doggy youaposll ever see. My master is very sorry he had to leave me here with you, but he just canapost look after me anymore. I am very sorry about that as Iaposm sure he is too. Please take me into your home. Please let me be part of your family. Please love me. I am a goldendoodle, I am five years old this year and I have not been neutered. I am very nice, I havenapost bitten anyone, ever! I am a good guard dog who will sit in front of your door all day, and bark at anyone who comes to your gate. Until you tell me to stop. OrI know the person very well. I can do some tricks too! I hope youaposll accept me. With love and some woof, Siggy.  The note left Lionel in tears and he decided to take the poor pup home, where he fed and bathed her, dried her off and let her sleep in a cosy bed he created under the safety of his sofa. His previously adopted dog Sammo didnapost get along with Siggy, so Lionelaposs brother is taking care of him while Lionel and Siggy stay in temporary accomodation. Lionel said: She had formed the most intense, most pleading eye contact with me from under her matted fringe. I unhooked the note, opened it up and read it right there crouched by the roadside. I broke down in tears.

David, from New Jersey, developed a foot and nail fungus five years ago and says the condition left him unable to walk properly. Other than their appearance, David’s feet cause him constant pain, and he struggles slipping his shoes on and off. He eventually sought the help of foot and ankle surgeon Dr Brad Schaeffer as he appeared on the first-ever episode of the reality show My Feet Are Killing Me. When I removed David’s socks, there was just flakes and flakes coming off of his feet, Dr Brad recalled on the show. After developing the problem while dealing with the loss his loving mum, David said that he stopped taking care of himself the condition of his feet spiralled out of control. “Losing my mum, that just killed me. She was wonderful,” an emotional David reveals. David was left wincing as Dr Brad peeled off his socks to reveal his overgrown and twisted toenails which had turned yellow in the intervening years. I’ve seen bad cases, but this is the worst case of toenail fungus that I have seen, the doctor confessed.David’s nails were so long that they were curling on top of each other, almost bridging together. His skin was flaking off, you could literally take little pieces of it off. It looked like a croissant,’ he added to the camera. David said he had been in almost constant pain as walking became extremely dficult, made worse by the rock-hard callouses on the bottom of his feet.It hurts like hell. I’ve learnt to adapt and adjust, he admitted. In the show, Dr Schaeffer decides to carefully clip and file down David’s toenails, remove as much dead skin as possible, and give him a regime to take better care of his feet going forward. I’m going to chip away at David’s toenails, and once they’re removed I’m going to file them down so it looks like a normal foot.

Regional government chiefs said today that they hope to re-open hotels in popular spots, including Tenere, to Spanish visitors in July and August. However, they are unlikely to receive foreign holidaymakers until the autumn. Speaking to the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, Canary Islands president Angel Victor Torres said the road back to recovery from the coronavirus pandemic would have to be gradual. That way, in October, November or December, which are good months in the Canary Islands, we can begin to receive tourists from other countries, he explained.

Around  million Brit tourists visit Spain annually, making the country the UKaposs number one holiday destination.The Canary Islands were the first to have coronavirus in Spain and now we want to be the first out of confinement, Mr Torres continued. Juanma Moreno, president of the Andalucia region, says he is also optimistic that the Costa del Solaposs beaches could re-open this summer. However, he suggested that sunbathers might have to be monitored by police, with sections cordoned off to enable some social distancing. Hotels and restaurant owners have been proposing safety measures such as daily disinfection, micro-biological cleansing and taking peopleaposs temperatures, he added.  “It’s not what we’re used to but unfortunately while we haven’t got an effective treatment or a coronavirus vaccine, it’s something we’ll have to get used to, he said. Spain has been hit with the highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe with ,, a number which is second only to the US globally. It has suffered the worldaposs third highest death toll, with , lives lost. The country suffered a setback in its fight against the deadly bug today after a small rise in the number of deaths.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water.

The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

As Patrick Baker paddled his kayak past wobbling purple and white jellyfish and the occasional porpoise, battling to beat the temperamental currents, the deserted island of Belnahua took shape.Once ashore, he trekked over the beach and the overgrown grass to reach deserted terraced homes where dozens of slate quarry workers and their families once lived. Long since abandoned, the dilapidated walls and rusting machinery remain rooted, crumbling monuments to an almost forgotten age when Scottish island mined slate put a roof over the world.ldquoBelnahua was very ghostly, says Baker, an Edinburgh-based outdoor writer whose new book The Unremembered Placesexplores some of Scotlandrsquos wild, often overlooked locations and unravels the fascinating stories embedded in their past.ldquoIt was eerie and poignant and beautul, he continues. ldquoThe journey to Belnahua adds to its mystique. The island has that rare frozen-in-time quality to it.ldquoLots of the places I ended up visiting had that same feeling.Part travelogue and part social history, Baker has recorded his journeys to locations that have fallen off the beaten track: hidden caves, a quiet Highland reservoir with a deadly human toll linked to its construction, and secluded islands.Despite doing the footwork to become familiar with each before setting off, often these \"unremembered\" places still managed to capture Baker off-guard either by their enigmatic beauty or a tiny detail that shed new light on their seldom-told histories.At Belnahua, once at the epicentre of a mammoth slate industry which saw it and its neighbouring islands send Dalradian slate around the world, Baker picked his way through the \"ghost village\" with its abandoned homes, corroded machinery, rusted steam-driven crane and flooded quarries.Beyond the physical remains, he unravelled a much deeper story of island communities surrounded by turbulent waters which carried an astonishing number of vessels ndash a fair number of which would end up wrecked as they battled against the harsh, stormy Atlantic waters.ldquoThat brutality of the winter storms and their location on the edge of the Atlantic, would have made it an incredible place to live, says Baker. ldquoAt one point the water around Belnahua was one of the busiest watercourses around the UK, which is incredible to think of.A series of economic and natural calamities including a storm which Baker describes as being ldquoof epic proportions devastated the industry, leaving ft deep mines flooded by the swell of seawater which drenched their workings, and families with no work or reason to stay.Once home to more than  people at the slate industryrsquos peak at the end of the th century, by the s the island was empty.ldquoIt feels like it has been deserted, reflects Baker, whose book links the growth of the slate industry with bustling sea traffic and the rise of lighthouses to guide vessels on their way.ldquoIt was a rapid turnaround of being a very populated island with many people living on a tiny patch of land, to being completely deserted within a matter of weeks.ldquoIt has a feeling of rapid desertion to it. Itrsquos quite eerie but fascinating with machinery lying where it was left and no-one going to remove it.ldquoThe houses are there, he adds. ldquoBut what struck me was the row of deserted cottages which housed the slate miners and their families.ldquoIt banks to a small beach that is just footsteps from the front door to the water. I stood there and thought what an incredible place to live, but equally what a very hard and brutal place.ldquoItrsquos only really when you visit these places that you can transpose yourself into what it must have been like to live there and experience that.ldquoAnd Belnhua is very visceral and very real.While some \"unremembered\" spots are remote and challenging to reach, such as Blackwater Reservoir in Lochaber where he was taken aback by the small graveyard and the human cost of creating the dam, others are far closer to urban le.The Glen Loin Caves near Arrochar in West Dunbartonshire are the reputed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his army after the Battle of Methven in . However, Baker points out that much more recently they were a focal point for working-class sporting prowess.For two decades from the s, groups from the hard-working shipyards and poverty-stricken Glasgow tenements made the area their playground, taking up weekend residence in the caves from where they would climb the rocky walls of the \"Arrochar Alps\".The climbing clubs they formed would go on to lay the foundations for the sportrsquos modern standards, techniques and ethics.However, as years passed, the location of the caves they frequented became largely forgotten Bakerrsquos search for them resulting in a frustrating challenge over jagged rocks, through pines and across overgrown gashes in the hillside before finally stumbling into the dark, gaping entrance.ldquoSome of the places are pretty remote and hard to get to which may be a discouragement to people seeking to visit them, says Baker, as he explains the balance to be struck between drawing attention to secluded, forgotten spots and attracting people to visit.ldquoWe want to share the wonderment we are seeing and share these stories, he adds, ldquobut we donrsquot want to degrade the places or their mystery.Thatrsquos a particular issue for the \"wild\" islands he visits, dotted across Loch Awe and Loch Shiel, havens for wildle, some harbouring centuries-old graveyards or, in the case of Eilean Fhianain, once home to Irish missionary Saint Finnan and with its ruined chapel and burial grounds.Other islands revealed another side to their previously well-documented character.Baker explored Inchkeith Island, three miles north of Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth, aware of its prominence as a stop-off point for vessels between Fe and Edinburgh since the th century but surprised to discover its links to a bizarre attempt to invade the Port of Leith.ldquoI often had an idea about the story that was going to unravel in a particular place, and then found out other elements, says Baker, whose book covers eight destinations, each with its own character and signicance.ldquoIt was fascinating to find out about Inchkeithrsquos strategic importance and how, in , it was used as a sort of staging post for a fleet under the command of Scots-born John Paul Jones, who effectively founded the US Navy.A squadron of five ships had gathered at the mouth of the estuary near Dunbar, sparking panic in towns along the coast.Sailing under a commission for the Continental Navy for the American Colonies, John Paul Jones was known for attacking British naval and merchant ships and launching land offensives.His sights on this occasion, writes Baker, were set on Leith.Having penned a letter threatening to attack the port, his vessels took anchor at Inchkeith Island to await their next move.As luck had it, a fierce westerly gale put paid to Jonesrsquos plans. Having been prevented from reaching the port, Jones decided it was ldquoimpossible to pursue the enterprise with a good prospect of success.Baker, who has previously written about stories and landscape of the Cairngorms, says while the \"unremembered\" locations explored in his book may seem disparate, they share common links.ldquoScotlandrsquos wild histories ... speak of immeasurable social change, of the movement of people through time and landscape, he writes. ldquoYet they are often lost, overlooked or passed by.ldquoThey still have cultural relevance, but we donrsquot tend to give them enough signicance.

We got the keys to the cottage on a brilliantly frosty Friday and moved our belongings in over the weekend. Until then, wersquod forgotten that we had nothing to sleep on. Two nights in a nearby hotel was our last experience of domestic warmth for many months to come. A mattress was delivered on the Monday, which was also the day the first tradespeople arrived, to measure for shutters. With Christmas looming, we needed to put things in place as fast as possible, ahead of the long festive shutdown or, as that chapter in our memoirs will read, The Big Freeze.It would be quicker to tell you who hasnrsquot been over the door these past two years. Thanks to ill-fitting windows, draughty doors, a leaking roof, and a central heating system suffering from poor circulation, for the first three months I worked in the kitchen, as close to the boiler as I could get. Some books are kept under wraps until the day of publication, but the one I was battling with was typed from beneath layers of thermals, wool and eiderdown, with a hot water bottle on my lap where once there had been a cat.The extent of our igloo-like crisis was brought home the day we stood in front of the French windows, discussing triple glazing with the man from Everest. His breath and ours met as we spoke, sending up a mushroom cloud above the packing boxes. Snow fell steadily outside, blown sideways by a gale, like a film directorrsquos idea of a backwoods scene. Somehow it also managed to get inside, through the jambs. At this point the comparison with an igloo, which is better built and insulated, collapses.In the months since, we feel aswersquove got to know half of the Bordersrsquo tradesmen. Each week the diary has been stuffed with appointments, as we set about tackling all our problems, some immediately evident, others only making themselves known after stormy weather or excavation.The local economy must surely have taken an upturn since we arrived. Diary entries from the week we arrived to the Friday before lockdown began show that we have had window fitters, joiners , plumbers, heating engineers, roofers, painters, locksmiths, glaziers, IT experts, telephone engineer, loft insulators, pest controller, kitchen fitters, electricians, wood-burning stove suppliers, carpet cleaners, carpet layers, stone masons, carpenters, plasterers, chimney sweep, fencers, drystone dykers, and a landscape gardener, all contributing to the home front.We even had a man with a scythe to tackle the so-called lawn which, after a fortnightrsquos absence in the first springtime, had turned into a waist-high meadow. After that he came every two weeks with his Rolls-Royce of a lawnmower and extendable shears, to keep the ancient beech hedge under control. Hisevery spring after the long winter is a bright spot on the calendar.Men ndash and apart from one Polish window fitter and a locksmith who replaced several door latches they have all been men ndash have inspected the chimneys by binoculars and ladder, crept into the crawl space under the roof with torch in mouth, and delved beneath floors in an attempt to trace the labyrinth of pipes. Irsquove seen the original th-century lath and plasterwork exposed in the kitchen, and been shown a field drain predating the cottage at the front. The old cart house at the back, which later became a cobblerrsquos, was reached by a flagged path, and remnants of this, which had served for  years and more, were exposed when our tumbledown old wall was rebuilt. That would explain why, previously, whenever Alan attempted to drive a spade into this part of the garden he would shudder ashersquod had an electric shock.Clearing the front flowerbed a couple of weeks ago, I pulled out a long-buried rubber pipe, perished with age, which disappeared, goodness knows where, under the Buddleia. While I was tugging, Alan came upon a smooth oval stone, so hefty he could barely budge it. It was either the mould for a giant Easter egg, or the first rugby ball in the Borders.If there is one common factor with the army that has worked on the house, it is rugby. An astonishing number of tradesmen are either players or former players. All but a very few are avid followers. One chap was undergoing treatment for his latest injuries when he first turned up, having on earlier occasions broken his back and a leg at play. He was clearly in a lot of pain but, several months and many injections later, he was finally fit to rejoin his team.Give how physical their work is, you can see why so many of them are sportsmen. There was one young man who, unbeknownst to us, was clambering around our rooftop without any sign of a harness, nearly giving our neighbour across the green palpitations. For the space of five days while he worked, the front door stood wide open ndash it was January ndash but when I askedthe cold bothered him, he said he liked it. He never put the heating on in his flat.Two months later, in the wake of the Beast from the East, the kitchen was installed and the door stood ajar for a further five days.

My more conscious awareness is of a fear for an unknown future, but like everything in le we must all try and make the best of the situation we are presented with.Lets take this time and savour it. It may be the only time we have with our families ndash , like me, you have your three children at home before two of them are hopefully able to start their next adventure at colleges across the country.We traded our city home in Edinburgh for a one in the country about nine years ago. The one-hour long commute is torture during normal times, but being here today it feels like a little bit of heaven.Our kitchen garden, normally only for the restaurant, is providing deliveries for our community and a little salad for ourselves.

Leave the bottle of Pimmrsquos and lemonade in the fridge overnight as it keeps the drink colder. Wash the cucumber and slice into diagonal strips about mm thick. When they are this shape itrsquos easy to pick them up and eat them. Add the cucumber, mint, orange and ice to the jug. Add the Pimmrsquos and top up with lemonade. Decorate with the strawberries and relax.Chilli BBQ ChickenThis recipe can be cooked in the oven or on a BBQ.Serves Ingredientsbull  green chillies, seeds removed and finely choppedbull  cloves of garlic, peeledbull  whole unwaxed lemon or  preserved lemon, pips removedbull  tbsp extra virgin olive oilbull Generous pinch of saltbull Large handful of fresh parsley, leaves onlybull Large handful of fresh coriander, leaves onlybull .kg lb oz free-range or organic chicken, backbone removed and squashed flat and lay skin side up on a roasting trayMethod Cut the lemon in half and remove any seeds. Mix all of the ingredients in the blender or food processor until smooth. Pour this mixture over the chicken and gently rub in. Leave to marinade for at least an hour. Sprinkle some more salt over the chicken and a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil. Roast at degC degF Gas  for  minutes so the skin becomes lovely and tasty then lower the oven to degC degF Gas  and cook for another  minutes or so until the leg of the chicken easily removes from the carcass.Strawberry PavlovaWith the first of the Scottish strawberries hitting the shops this is the perfect dessert.Serves Ingredientsbull g free range egg whites bull g caster sugarbull A pinch of saltbull  heaped tsp cornflourbull  tsp vanilla extractbull  tsp white wine vinegarbull  x g punnets of fresh strawberries, stalks removed and cut into quartersbull  x g punnet of fresh raspberriesbull g icing sugarbull ml of double creamMethod Preheat your oven to degC degF Gas  Carefully separate the egg whites and beat with the pinch of sugar until very stf. Very slowly beat in the caster sugar. I do this one teaspoon at a time to ensure the air stays in the mixture. When all the sugar has been added, mix the vanilla, vinegar and cornflour and then beat into the meringue. Rather than using a baking sheet lined with parchment I use a ceramic pie dishand oil very lightly. I serve the pavlova in this dish so it looks pretty and stops the chances of the meringue breaking. Fill the dish with thick scoops of the mixture to form the pavlova shape and bake in a preheated oven for  minutes then turn off the oven and leave for a further  minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile heat one punnet of raspberries with the icing sugar in a pan until the raspberries start to pop and the sugar has dissolved. Cook for about  or  minutes, stirring to ensure the mixture doesnt burn. Cool and then sieve the seeds to make a coulis and add the strawberries to the coulis. Whip the double cream until soft peaks form and then spoon the cream onto the pavlova and then dress with the strawberry mixture."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown-recipe-umi-edinburgh-teriyaki-salmon-plus-use-chopsticks","story":"Umi was opened with the aim of bringing authentic Japanese ramen to Scotlandrsquos capital ndash they believe ramen can bring joy and happiness to a dinerrsquos day.Red paper lanterns, horigotatsu tables with cushions, shoji doors, rattan chairs and murals reflecting the Japanese street scene create a traditional, immersive and bustling atmosphere.

There are  people in intensive care with confirmed coronavirus or Covid- symptoms, a decrease of five on Sunday, - while , people are in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-.\"Towards the end of this week I will set out some of the factors that will guide our thinking for the future,\" the First Minister said.But the \"initial version of this work\" will not set out which measures will be lted and when, she said.Ms Sturgeon added: \"We are simply not yet in position to take those decisions in a properly informed way and I will not rush to do anything that could risk a resurgence of this virus, because to do that would risk overwhelming the national health service and it would put many more lives at risk.\":Coronavirus: Jason Leitch: Scotlands exit strategy may dfer to rest of UKsShe said the Scottish Government will set out its objective to \"continue to suppress the virus while considering how even we can even gradually restore a semblance of normality to everyday le\" - but some restrictions on everyday le will continue for \"a while to come\".In Germany, where the same experts have been advising the Scottish Government, some restrictions have been lted by authorities as the country tries to reboot the economy.The Scottish Government said the disuions were with \"an external scientic adviser to the German government\" who was \"expressing his own views\".The Robert Koch Institute is the German Governmentrsquos main public health advisory body.The German government is also being advised by the Leopoldina Science Association and the German Ethikrat.Germany started gradually lting the lockdown yesterday - with smaller shops re-opening and some schools due to welcome pupils again on May  - but mass gatherings will remain banned.Shops with a surface area of up to  square meters were being allowed to reopen on Monday, along with car showrooms, bike shops and bookshops of any size, under an agreement reached last week between the federal and state governments.German Chancellor Angela Merkels chief of staff, Helge Braun, told n-tv television that big shops \"draw large numbers of people into the city centre, they have high customer numbers and that isnt possible in the first step\".The German government believes it has managed to curb the outbreak due to social distancing measures introduced after an early surge in cases.The strategy mirrors the words of Scotlandrsquos national clinical director, Jason Leitch, who has indicated that the number of people each person infects, the R-naught number, must remain low before any lockdown measures can be lted.He said: ldquoWe believe the R-naught in Scotland is below one, but we have to keep that sustained for a period of time to allow the numbers to fall.The Robert Koch Institute has revealed that Germanyrsquos R-naught number has dropped to ., meaning that each person carrying the virus was now, on average, infecting less than one other person.If Scotland is to follow Germanyrsquos path out of the lockdown, mass testing is likely to play a key role - with Nicola Sturgeon suggesting that \"test, trace and isolate\" will form part of any future strategy.The UK Governmentrsquos chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty has admitted that Germany ldquogot ahead with testing and that ldquotherersquos a lot to learn from that - while the countrys response has been routinely praised.Last week, Professor Leitch, warned that Scotland must avoid the ldquodoomsday scenario of a second wave of Covid- and must learn from the mistakes of other countries.Professor Leitch pointed to Hokkaido in Japan, with a similar population to Scotland, as an example of what could happenrestrictions are lted too early on in the process.The island lted social distancing restrictions after five weeks only for new cases in the second wave to outnumber the initial outbreak - forcing the lockdown to be reimplemented.Scotlands interim chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith, said: ldquoTherersquos not one country that we are looking at but many, many countries, to see what we can learn from a iety of dferent approaches.ldquoMy advisory group of scientists is currently examining the strategies that are currently being deployed across more than a dozen dferent areas to see exactly what the impacts that those strategies are having in those countries - and also whether they would be able and feasible to be applied within our own cultures in Scotland as well.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Sturgeon questions bailouts for tax haven firmsldquoI think it would be wrong to give the impression that we are only looking at one country - but we are trying to learn form the international community in terms of what might work as we move towards the next phase.Ideas being considered include possibly lting the restrictions in phases - either for dferent groups of people or dferent parts of Scotland - while dferent sectors of the economy could potentially re-open at dferent times.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Government CMO Covid- Advisory Group has regular engagement, through its expert members, with the international scientic community to share expertise and learning on responding to the pandemic.ldquoLearning from other countries is an important part of effectively responding to the pandemic, and the advisory grouprsquos international connections are helpful in facilitating this learning.Professor Carl Heneghan, director of the centre for evidence-based medicine at Oxford University, said the lockdown was likely to do more damage than coronavirus itself.The practising GP told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme that not enough testing had been carried out.He said: ldquoThe key is no-one has really understood how many people actually have the infection.ldquoYou could do that really quickly with random sampling of a thousand people in London who thought they had the symptoms.:UK Govt signals any substantial lting of lockdown restrictions months away as it warns of second peak of virusldquoYou could do that in the next couple of days and get a really key handle on that problem and wersquod be able to then understand coming out of lockdown much quicker.ldquoIn fact, the damaging effect now of lockdown is going to outweigh the damaging effect of coronavirus.The UK Governments next review of the lockdown is expected on May  with the latest advice from the Governmentrsquos expert group SAGE due by the end of the month.ldquoThe big concern is a second peak, declared a Downing St spokesman. \"That is what ultimately will do the most damage to health and the most damage to the economy. If you move too quickly, then the virus could begin to spread exponentially again.\"The public will expect us to do everything we can to stop the spread of the virus and protect lives,\" he added.At the daily Downing St briefing, Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, said it would be ldquowrong to speculate about lting restrictions at this stage and people should continue to focus on abiding by the restrictions.ldquoAt this stage of the crisis we are absolutely focused on sticking to the guidance.

Facts, being statements of truth about particular moments in time, can change ndash like the way doctors ask people with concussion who the Prime Minister is at the moment. OK, maybe thatrsquos a bad example. But we usually think of a fact as an objective, unchanging truth.What does change, however, is information, or understanding. Itrsquos perfectly likely, indeed, almost a certainty, that the authorities made mistakes in their initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Thatrsquos probably true whether wersquore talking about the UK Government, or its scientic advisors, or Public Health England, or Health Protection Scotland, or their equivalents in the dozens of other countries dealing with this emergency.By definition, some countries and health systems will have done better than others. Establishing which measures have been most effective in curtailing the spread of the disease is a matter, not merely of interest, but of vital importance in enabling us to contain and manage the crisis. The role of trusted media in asking such questions has seldom been so important, evenit has seldom been so dficult.It is dficult not merely because epidemics, and their occurrence, severity and distribution involves complex microbiology and statistical analysis: a surprising number of people on social mediawill assure you that they are much better informed on those subjects than world-renowned scientists. Thatrsquos one reason why traditional, rigorously fact-checked, reporting from established sources is crucial.But it is problematic, too, because to put it bluntly, there is no other story apart from this one and, consequently, there is a constant search for answers that are not going to be available for some time. If you doubt this, consider another major global health emergency: HIV was identied in  and although our understanding of it, and ability to treat its effects, is now fairly good, there is still no vaccine, despite the fact that we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on research.It is reasonable ndash essential ndash to ask questions such as: does wearing a mask do much in the way of preventing the spread of disease  Or,you have recovered from coronavirus, do you have a degree of immunity  Andso, for how long  But unfortunately, the answers may not be forthcoming, and you may get dferent ones depending on who you ask. Science has ndash as with smallpox or cholera ndash triumphantly produced answers to such questions, but does not iniably do so, and usually not quickly, or without a great deal of careful analysis and discarded theories.Itrsquos therefore ndash at least apparently ndash easier to ask questions about policy. Whether the Government has bungled its response, whether it could have held meetings a few days earlier, and whether it ought to have funded programmes dferently these are all the kinds of things that seem to be news, fruitful avenues of inquiry, and where we might get some kind of definitive answer. And no doubt, in the long run, we shall.There are, however, plenty of reasons to be cautious about rushing to judgment even on those questions, and for examining our motives and conclusions carefully. It would be bizarre, for example, to argue that the UK Government response has been shoddy, while approving of the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach, since it would be dficult to put a cigarette paper between the two. And while itrsquos worth noting that Irelandrsquos statistics look much better than the UKrsquos, that canrsquot be entirely because of policy, since Northern Ireland has the same guidelines as the mainland, and so far a lower rate of infection than the Republic.There will inevitably have been errors in strategy and deficiencies in the approach of almost everyone in dealing with this pandemic.

It may well be that the true impact of the pandemic is being underplayed by officialdom so as not to ldquoscare the horses but what is happening and could be interpreted as the Establishment being less than open simply to protect itself and certain iniduals who have deliberately chosen to ignore repeated warnings by experts and the findings of their own ldquoburied Cygnus exercise report. All of the operational and equipment problems currently being experienced by our NHS staff were predicted and could have in the main been avoided. Why other than to save money do we import PPE and not manufacture it here  Why do our hospital ICU staff not have a laundry service or decent changing and showering facilities  Those of us who have any NHS experience are aware that it is suffering death by a thousand cuts yet we can afford to start HS. The country can stockpile atomic weapons but not masks and gowns. Stupid.Itrsquos again worth reminding ourselves that those in the know calculate that  years of austerity caused the premature deaths of , iniduals in the main from the same backgrounds as are being felled by Covid-. It may seem simplistic, but we live in an ldquous and them society where ldquothem still have the power and history and current events clearly demonstrate they donrsquot give a damn about us. For the sake of our increasingly elderly population we need to make sure that this never ever happens again, aswe donrsquot make fundamental changes itrsquos just a matter of time till it does. Heads need to roll.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.WHEN, in face of the failure of PPE provision and the roll-out of testing , Matt Hancock is fired by the Prime Minister or steps aside quoting the standard formulaic reasons of stress or family pressures, can we be clear on the key attributes his replacement must dis-play These must be truth and accuracy on the stock levels locally and the restocking of PPE, test kits, oxy-gen, and essential drugs acknowledging at all times pressure points and shortages before the press or frontline medical staff bring these to light. Direct answers to briefing questions. Transparency at all times so that the public is aware that  tonnes arriving whenever it does arrive from Turkey represents only three days supply of gowns. Then an acceptance in all public briefings that the Government was not prepared at the outset for this Tier  emergency and was slow to react while showing a new willingness to be open in spelling out the detail of the steps being taken to catch up and make progress in a crowded marketplace where worldwide demand is unparalleled.There can be no repeat of the slippery Hancock approach that the public and front-line staff cannot be trusted with the truth. The brave alternative, of course, is to come to the podium in humility with a genuine apology and an undertaking that he will seek, going forward, to adopt these key attributes all before his sacking becomes inevitable as Boris Johnson on hisseeks to deflect the growing criticism of his Government.Anthony Ireland, Glasgow G.WHEN Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, stated at the UK Government Corona-virus briefing on Sunday that ldquodferent countries may be experiencing slightly dferent rates , she was guilty of grossly misrepresenting comparative UK death rates. The only ldquointernational chart exhibited at this briefing was seemingly a crude attempt to hide numbers of UK deaths in ldquohospitals only among numbers for countries in Europe which sustained the earliest im-pact of the pandemic, Italy, Spain and France .There are many countries around the world, from our near neighbours Ireland, Norway and Denmark, to Poland and Greece, as well as to Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand, that appear to have much low-er Covid--related death rates than the UK. If Dr Harries and the UK Government were truly being transparent on a fundamental aspect of the current health catastrophe this chart would include a clearly visible best estimateof all deaths where Covid- was the cause, or suspected to be a factor, so that the general public could better assess for themselves the UK figures in comparison with other countries. Across Europe the estimates of deaths in care homes appear to range from  per cent to  per cent and while such estimates may not be directly comparable from country to country, a resultant calculation that total deaths in the UK may be around  per cent higher than the numbers of deaths in ldquohospitals only does not appear unrealistic.When Dr Harries also declared on Sunday that the UK was an ldquointernational exemplar in preparednessone must start to question the professional objectivity,not the political independence, of \"expert advice\" provided, and on which, at this time, many lives across the UK depend.Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.SO Michael Gove believes that the lting of lockdown will require ldquobalanced judgment.Eh, Houston, we have a problemhellipJohn NE Rankin, Bridge of Allan.WHEN I was about , my mother showed me how to thread a needle. Now a man of , I am happy to sew on the occasional shirt, jacket or coat button. With a small stone egg cup in the toe or heel, I darn a sock adequately. That is however the full extent of my tailoring abilities.As a past work study and production engineer, I see a surgical gown as a large rectangle of material, scalloped on one edge for the neck and two holes for arms. Two other rectangles are stitched into tubes for arms, in turn stitched into the body. Three Velcro ties are added to complete. It is probably hemmed to prevent fraying. The material will be a specied weight and weave. Am I missing something Is there really nowhere in the UK that can mass-produce this item  The fashion industry must be on its knees presently. Do we need to go to Turkey and China for this Is it time for NHS and government procurement organisations to draft in a team of experts from Amazon, Marks  Spencer and Boots, all under one roof with Army logistics people in charge. What is needed is someone who can shout loud, swear and kick ass to ldquoget things done.Robert Wolfenden, Biggar.IT is a sad state of affairs that our dedicated nurses, doctors and carers are desperately short of PPE while we wait for consignments from Turkey. Why can sewing and alterations shops that are closed in Britain due to the lockdown not start sewing gowns and the Government pay them a rate for doing so  That would provide an income for struggling businesses and PPE quickly. Remember the effort of the last war  Everyone was at the helm. It is time for everyone to come together.Gordon Kennedy, Perth.LAST Fridayrsquos news standswere an eye-catching and colourful array with each title carrying a wrap-around with a message from the Government urging the public to follow the advice and ldquostay at home for the NHS, your family, your neighbours, your nation, the world and le itself.Thatrsquos a big ask, but there is widespread support for this policy among the public as the quiet streets and empty buses and trains testy and getting this message out prior to a weekend of fine spring weather was a sensible public awareness exercise ndash but what possessed the Government department responsible for the text to include the exhortation to ldquoclap our carers pm every Thursday The weekly national phenomenon of the public coming together on doorsteps, at their windows and on street corners to express their collective support and thanks for the work NHS staff and carers do is heart-warming and emotional, but was born of a spontaneous public reaction. For the Government to appropriate this movement and incorporate its message in its own publicity, was a cheap attempt to suggest that it is a part of a Government-sponsored programme.There is a sense that, when the public turn out in such large numbers to clap and cheer, they are making up in emotional terms for what the Government has failed to do in the provision of resources. This insensitive tagging on of a public movement to an official Government publication appears opportunistic, and may risk the danger that the public will treat future Government pleas to moderate their behaviour as cynical manipulation.The Governmentrsquos job is to ensure that the NHS and the carers have the resources necessary to carry out their work, not to attempt to ingratiate itself with the public by acting as a cheerleader for a cam-paign in which it had no part in generating.Ian Hutcheson, Glasgow G.WHY is the press having to assume the role of effective opposition to the Government and hold it to account  Where are Labour and the SNP Ian Johnstone, Connel, Argyll.TO give a balanced picture during the lockdown, the government should publish weekly figures for lost GDP, lost tax revenue and the increase in unemployment. We should also know how many patients have had cancer and other vital treatment delayed or cancelled. Each week the increase in the national debt, which is already a horrying pound trillion, should also be announced.Health statisticians will then be able to estimate how many extra deaths there are likely to be as a result of the lost growth, extra unemployment and untreated patients. Very quickly ending the lockdown would become a priority.Otto Inglis, Crossgates, Fe.WITH regard to the \"Do not Resuscitatersquorsquo furore during the present coronavirus crisis, may I say as a member of one of the so-called vulnerable groups, that I welcome the opportunity to be left to die should the case be hopeless.Hopefully the situation may never arise, but having the choice gives me a comfort of sorts.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

If any place could be described as socially distant it would be New Zealand, surrounded by stormy seas, with Antarctica to the south. With five million people spread across an area the size of Britain, even the cities are not overly crowded.And Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has taken bold steps, putting the country under a strict lockdown in late March, when only about  people had tested positive for the new virus. Her motto: ldquoGo hard and go early.New Zealand has so far avoided a widespread outbreak, and new cases have dwindled from a peak of about  per day in early April to just five on Tuesday, leaving the goal tantalisingly close. Only  people have died so far, and Ms Ardern has been personally briefed on each death.ldquoWe have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved: elimination of the virus, Ardern told reporters last week.ldquoBut it will continue to need a team of five million behind it.Ms Petousis-Harris said the country had managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that had hampered the response in many other places.ldquoNew Zealand got everything right, she said. ldquoDecisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody.Ms Ardern on Monday announced the country would stay in lockdown for another week before slightly easing some work restrictions to help restart the economy. Most social restrictions will remain in place.She also tried to temper expectations of her goal, saying elimination did not mean new cases would not arise in the future, but they would be stamped out immediately.New cases are likely when New Zealand eventually reopens its borders, but questions remain about how well prepared the health system is to implement effective contact tracing should a widespread outbreak occur. Ms Petousis-Harris pointed to problems last year when the country failed to contain a measles outbreak.EvenNew Zealand does purge itself of the virus, the effects will linger.

Google mobility data indicates there has been high compliance.One of the most symbolic casualties of the outbreak has been Air New Zealand.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain.

The quiz, devised by Steph and the fundraising team at CLAN, includes questions on local knowledge as well as current events, entertainment and travel.Steph said: “We have had a fantastic response from people, not only from the north-east but across the UK to the CLAN Sunday Sofa Quiz.#We were looking for a way to continue to engage with our supporters, keep people entertained at home, and to help raise vital funds for people affected by cancer.#Over  teams took part this weekend, with the number taking part growing every week. It’s a fun thing for all the family to take part in and raises money for CLAN at a very dficult time for the charity.“Being in lockdown is challenging for everyone, but even more so for those faced with a cancer diagnosis. That’s online fundraising is help us continue our telephone, email and online resource centre, as well as CLAN Haven, our bed and breakfast facility for those attending cancer treatment at ARI.”The Sunday Sofa Quiz can be accessed through CLAN’s Facebook page, and also through its website at clanhouse.org.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward.

That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in .

Prof Pennington said the Western Isles, which at the start of the week had only six confirmed cases of Covid-, could exit the restrictions as a “test-bed” before wider lockdowns were lted.Politicians said the idea was worth considering, but still carried risk.Prof Pennington said: #There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions # such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.#The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.#As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected.”He added that effective testing facilities, which would give a quick result, must first be in place to allow any restrictions to be eased.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said that while the idea had merit, islanders would be alarmedthey felt their health was being compromised as part of an experiment.He said: #It is unfortunate that the language of ‘testbeds’ has been used by some to describe the Western Isles, which has disturbed a number of people who have contacted me about this subject.“We have a population that is more elderly and more vulnerable to this virus than most, and so slowing down the spread of the virus has to be our overriding priority.“Despite the fact we have a low number of confirmed cases, the true number of infected islanders is likely to be signicantly higher. There is certainly now a need for more testing locally.#We need to keep observing the social distancing guidelines and cannot allow any room for complacency.“Given that we may well be behind the infection curve for the rest of Scotland, there is a good case to be made for a regional approach to lting lockdown restrictions, when that happens. However, this also has to ensure that the islands are not subject to any influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has already peaked.”Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Donald Cameron added: “Any proposal to trial a relaxation of the lockdown rules must have the full support of local residents with the protection of the most vulnerable remaining paramount, as well as ensuring the NHS is not put under any unnecessary strain.“However, the geography of the islands means they are suitable for a possible trial and Professor Pennington’s suggestions certainly deserve serious consideration.“Given the fragile nature of the islands# local economy at this time, we need to give our communities every chance of not only getting through this pandemic but also kick-starting a recovery as quickly as possible.

The project came about when Village Blinds was forced to close temporarily due to the ongoing COVID- pandemic.“Although we had taken the decision to close temporarily, we wanted to do something to help in providing a product or service for our incredible NHS staff and care workers,” explained Harold. “With the urgent need for scrubs so highly documented, we knew this was something practical that we could help with.”With many fabric manufacturers also closed temporarily, Harold struggled to source a bulk fabric initially, until he spoke to Kevin Devlin, managing director of fabric manufacturer William Clark and Sons in Upperlands, Maghera.“Kevin kindly agreed to bring back some of his staff to produce the fabric we neededwe placed a minimum order of , metres,” continued Harold. “A friend immediately launched a fundraising campaign to raise the five-figure sum required to buy the fabric and, within days, we exceeded our target thanks to the kindness and generosity of hundreds of people.”“We had then started to cut and distribute the fabrics within our own factory to enable our stitcher volunteers to get to work. With the demand being so pressing, however, we had to switch to auto machine cutting of the scrubs, working with Bradfor’s from Rostrevor, who kindly offered their services free of charge. This allowed the , metres of fabric to be cut into pieces ready for stitching.”Harold and Alison distributed the fabric to what they described as “an exceptional band of stitchers”, made up of over  volunteers spread right across Mid and East Antrim – including Ballymena, Broughshane, Cullybackey, Cloughmills, Ahoghill and Larne. Groups involved included ‘Bannside Stitchers’, ‘Cloughmills Crochet Club’ and ‘Tullygarley Sewing Group’.“We are deeply indebted to each and every person involved either with the groups or as iniduals for their help and expertise,” said Harold. “Many of these amazing women are well over the age of  themselves and have been in isolation for weeks. With many of them professional stitchers from days gone by, the speed at which they have been able to work is outstanding and the workmanship and quality coming back from them is absolutely impeccable.“This project has had a hugely positive impact on them in one way or another. As well as being physically unwell, many of them were feeling very down and isolated by the ongoing lockdown. The opportunity to use their talent and skill in this way has really brought new le to them.”Harold and Alison have been operating a drop off and pick up service, distributing fabric to stitchers across the borough and picking up dozens of pairs of completed scrubs just days later.Over , pairs of scrubs are now in the process of being distributed, with some having gone already to Antrim and Causeway Hospitals and a number of nursing homes in Mid and East Antrim, as well as in Lisburn and Belfast.A collective statement from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Group Party Leaders – Councillors Gregg McKeen, Timothy Gaston, Keith Turner, Gerardine Mulvenna, Eugene Reid and James McKeown – praised Harold and Alison and their group of volunteers for their efforts.“In recent weeks we have seen many fantastic examples of businesses in Mid and East Antrim being proactive and really going out to their way to do anything they can to help in the fight against COVID-.“Harold and Alison McCloy, their ‘band of stitchers’ and all those who helped with this project in any way, are to be commended for this remarkable display of thoughtfulness, selflessness and generosity. Exemplying the outward-looking values that characterise the people of Mid and East Antrim, their kindness will be felt by hundreds of frontline NHS and care workers at a time of great need.”Harold and Alison are continuing to raise funds throughout the campaign, with new project being planned to help the NHS and local charities.

To keep pregnant women informed of these changes the Public Health Agencyhas launched a new Northern Ireland Maternity COVID- website. The website will provide pregnant women with information about services in their trust as well as useful information on what COVID- is and how it affects pregnancy.Alison Little, Consultant Midwe at the , said: “Pregnancy can be a wonderful experience, but it can also come with many worries and concerns. Given the current challenging situation this can just add to those worries, it is important that we provide pregnant women with the information they need to help lessen these worries.”The PHA has worked with the five Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland to ensure the information is relevant to pregnant woman.Dr Susie Finnegan, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Craigavon Area Hospital, said: “The website reflects the temporary changes in service, but also details the sources of support available during this time and alternative service provision provided.“Due to COVID-, the way we deliver maternity services has had to change, but it’s still the same professional, friendly staff delivering the service and ready to look after you.”The website also contains advice and guidance on the most commonly asked questions on maternity services, along with information on child health services, antenatal care and mental health.Alison added: “As this situation evolves, changes will occur to the services. We hope to use this website as a  to communicate with pregnant woman, so they are kept up-to-date and have a positive maternity journey.”The website can be found at www.ni-maternityFor further information on COVID- see www.pha.site coronavirus "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus restrictions in northern ireland may last for months as lockdown exit talks to begin","story":"Dr Michael McBride, Chief Medical Officer, during the daily media briefing at Stormont yesterdayPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Michael McBride, Chief Medical Officer, during the daily media briefing at Stormont yesterdayMark BainTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailDiscussions on how Northern Ireland will exit the Covid- lockdown will begin in the Assembly tomorrow - although the Chief Medical Officer has warned the public that some restrictions are likely to be in place for many months to come.Dr Michael McBride said that it was premature to talk of exit strategies and thatNorthern Ireland comes out of lockdown too soon the virus could rapidly re-emerge.It#s early days yet. Complacency is out greatest enemy here, said Dr McBride.It would be premature to my mind to say that we are through the worst of this.I think that any relaxation of those social distancing measures at this time, or any inability of the public to stick with this, then we will rapidly see a re-emergence of this virus and then again we will see our health service come under very signicant pressure.Dr McBride said that there is absolutely no doubt we will need to understand more about how this virus is behaving, adding: I think it#s premature to talk about exit strategies, or certainly use that term.Dr McBride also warned that Covid- is going nowhere.In many respects it is only in such times as we have immunity to this virus that we can absolutely begin to have that conversation about an exit strategy, he said.A vaccine is a very, very long way off. I think what is more likely in the interim is that we will develop some effective treatment which can reduce the impact in terms of those who develop severe illness.This virus is going nowhere. This virus is with us to stay. Social distancing measures of some form or other are going to be with us for a signicant period of time.And we will have to adjust to a new normal ... because it will not be ato le as we remember before Covid- for some many, many months.Our decisions will be informed by the best scientic evidence that we have and the modelling that we have available to us.We are likely to have some form of social distancing for quite some time to come and we are not at this stage at a point where it is wide or prudent to relax the measures that we currently have in place. Health Minister Robin Swann said that the Assembly will be meeting later this week to begin talks on how Northern Ireland can come out of lockdown.Mr Swann said: We need to look to a point beyond where we are now. It will be very much directed towards the steps we need to take, but without putting a timeline on it.One thing we are conscious of is that there has to be a recovery for Northern Ireland, there has to be ato the new normality that we will see in daily le until we get control of Covid-, should that be through a vaccine or through enhanced testing and tracing. What I don#t want to do at this point in time is give any indication that we have a date set as to when certain steps will be taken.That will be a decision for the Executive and the sequence of those will be driven by the health intelligence.There#s a great piece of work to be done, but it#s a piece of work the Executive are starting on, also how weto as normal as we possibly can.Mr Swann added: Covid- and coronavirus will be with us for quite some time.Dr McBride also dismissed criticism that Northern Ireland was too late in introducing social distancing measures.The virus evolved dferently in dferent parts of Europe, he said.The path of the epidemic in Northern Ireland is very similar, indeed probably a little bit lower than that even in the Republic of Ireland so at this juncture, while it is no cause for complacency, this is on a kne edge.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those workers are based in the Northern sector which takes in Derry, Strabane and Limavady. It comes after the Derry News revealed earlier this month that  workers were off across the Trust area because of COVID- - the illness that can affect your lungs and airways which is caused by coronavirus. Of those employees,  worked at Altnagelvin Hospital. There was a relatively even split between the numbers self-isolating due to symptoms of their own and those isolating because family members had symptoms. googletag.cmd.push Testing has been ramped up in dferent parts of NI, including Derry where a facility has just opened at City of Derry Rugby Club, to ensure that health and social care staff are kept safe. It is also hoped that testing will allow staff who are following government guidelines by isolating - but are not actually sick - toto work so they can assist during the first wave of coronavirus cases. However, according to the latest figures available  staff members are still absent. In a statement to the Derry News on Friday, a spokesperson for the Western Trust confirmed: “Whilst a number of staff have ed to work following a period of absence some staff have commenced new episodes of absence related to coronavirus. googletag.cmd.push “The total number of staff absent as at th April is . Since the introduction of testing on th March  and up to th April  a total of  Northern Sector staff have been tested – this covers both hospital and community staff.” Approximately , people responded to a workforce appeal by the Trust to allow it to cope with an increased demand on services in light of the coronavirus pandemic. That included retired doctors and student nurses who have joined the frontline. A quarter of those applicants have commenced work in a range of roles. A spokesperson explained. “The Trust recently launched a workforce appeal for staff and have appointed  staff to date. “The recruitment team is continuing to process a large number of applications.” Northern Ireland is nearing the end of what was described as the first wave of cases which was expected to peak between April -. Under this ‘reasonable worst case scenario’, the projected number of cumulative COVID- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,. The latest Public Health Agencybulletin, as of April , reports  deaths. It is believed that this peak may be less severe than first anticipated but last Thursday saw the highest daily rise with  COVID related deaths in NI hospitals. That total was matched on Friday and a further  people tested positive, a development Health Minister Robin Swann described was a ‘wake up call’ as he warned against complacency. On Saturday a further  deaths were registered and one more person was added to the overall death toll on Sunday. TESTING Almost , people have been tested for COVID- in Northern Ireland - over , of them health care workers. The current target is set at over , tests per day with a view to scaling up over time and expanding priority groups. The test centre at City of Derry Rugby Club will assist with that upscaling. Criticism has been levelled at the government for limited testing in the community and contact tracing as that will be crucial when it comes to estimating population immunity and designing an exit strategy to move out of the current lockdown. Speaking last week Minister of Health Robin Swann said: “Testing of health care workers has been a key priority of mine and I am glad that in recent weeks we have tested over , of our frontline staff. “That’s important for them, and it’s also important for the people they support such as the residents in our care homes.” He continued: ”An expert working group has also been established to lead on the expansion of testing across all our laboratory services, both within Health and Social Care facilities, and also to consider options for the utilisation of other testing facilities including within the commercial sector. “There is a NI Testing Strategy that has already been shared with the Executive and the Health Committee. In that I have made it clear that the overall testing policy will be adjusted over time as testing capacity increases, and priority groups for testing are expanded. “Similarly the strategy also includes a pledge that testing will soon move towards surveillance of COVID- in the population to inform planning of services including surge capacity, and to estimate population immunity.“  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A cinema, theatre or concert Hall can broadcast a performance to people outside the premises over the internet, or on radio or televisionEconomy Minister Diane Dodds published the guidance on making workplaces safer and the list of priority sectors which were drawn up by the Engagement Forum. The Forum was set up by the Minister to advise the Executive on the list of priority businesses sectors referred to in the Health Protection Regulations. It was also asked to advise on measures required to protect the safety of all workers. The forum is chaired by the Labour Relations Agencyand consists of representatives from business organisations, trade unions, local councils, government, the Health and Safety Executive NI, Public Health Agency and Food Standards Agency. It drew up a list of priority business sectors and developed guidance on safe working practices during the current COVID- crisis. The Minister presented these to the Executive on Monday, which agreed to publish both papers. SUPPLY CHAINS Speaking this week the Minister said: “It was very important that so many organisations from across our economy were represented and it is reassuring that they are united in their determination to work together towards a common goal. “The list is published for advisory purposes to allow companies to make their own decisions. If a company can work within the social distancing guidelines then it should do so. “The safety guidance will have practical application in the workplace. “Along with the accompanying guidance on safe working practices, the list is there to protect everyone in the workplace, to ensure our essential supply chains remain solid and to help Northern Ireland be ready to rebuild its economy when this crisis has passed.” She went on to say that the aim of the priority sectors list, which is fully supported by both business and union representatives on the Forum, is to clary what constitutes a priority sector at this time, and to support Northern Ireland companies to continue their business operations and protect the incomes of their workforces. The accompanying workplace safety guidance – ‘COVID-: Working Through This Together, A Practical Guide to Making Workplaces Safer’ – has been developed and informed by professional advice from the HSE, PHA and the LRA as well as input from an employer and trade union perspective.

A cinema, theatre or concert Hall can broadcast a performance to people outside the premises over the internet, or on radio or televisionEconomy Minister Diane Dodds published the guidance on making workplaces safer and the list of priority sectors which were drawn up by the Engagement Forum. The Forum was set up by the Minister to advise the Executive on the list of priority businesses sectors referred to in the Health Protection Regulations. It was also asked to advise on measures required to protect the safety of all workers. The forum is chaired by the Labour Relations Agencyand consists of representatives from business organisations, trade unions, local councils, government, the Health and Safety Executive NI, Public Health Agency and Food Standards Agency. It drew up a list of priority business sectors and developed guidance on safe working practices during the current COVID- crisis. The Minister presented these to the Executive on Monday, which agreed to publish both papers. SUPPLY CHAINS Speaking this week the Minister said: “It was very important that so many organisations from across our economy were represented and it is reassuring that they are united in their determination to work together towards a common goal. “The list is published for advisory purposes to allow companies to make their own decisions. If a company can work within the social distancing guidelines then it should do so. “The safety guidance will have practical application in the workplace. “Along with the accompanying guidance on safe working practices, the list is there to protect everyone in the workplace, to ensure our essential supply chains remain solid and to help Northern Ireland be ready to rebuild its economy when this crisis has passed.” She went on to say that the aim of the priority sectors list, which is fully supported by both business and union representatives on the Forum, is to clary what constitutes a priority sector at this time, and to support Northern Ireland companies to continue their business operations and protect the incomes of their workforces. The accompanying workplace safety guidance – ‘COVID-: Working Through This Together, A Practical Guide to Making Workplaces Safer’ – has been developed and informed by professional advice from the HSE, PHA and the LRA as well as input from an employer and trade union perspective.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

To this day, the  All-Ireland winning team remains Derrys flagship group. The foundations were dug long before Anthony Tohill plucked both throw-ins in the lashing rain of Newry, that started the ball rolling towards Sam. This week Michael McMullan delves deeper, back to where it all began. On that famous September Sunday in , Seamus Downey nipped between Mark OConnor and John Kerins before fisting Damian Cassidys cross-shot to set off an explosion of red and white on Hill  behind. It was the final shudder Derry needed to wade clear of the early Cork storm and en their strides towards Sam Maguire. googletag.cmd.push Every dream begins somewhere. The s was greeted with a raft of MacRory and Hogan Cups, following on from St Pius Vocational Schools glory. Added in was an Ulster U title and four All-Ireland minor final appearances – producing two wins. It was a golden era that helped assemble the crux of a team that would dine at the top table for most of a decade. Tradition emerges in cycles. The s saw Derry seniors regularly at Croke Park. They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

Schools officially closed because of the coronavirus pandemic on March . At the time, key workers were told that schools would remain open to provide supervised learning only for children who ‘absolutely need to attend’. Some parents have had dficulty finding places for their children including senior health care workers in the city. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “Figures collected for Wednesday  April for Derry City and Strabane District Council showed that  schools responded to a daily survey as being open, with  children reported as attending open schools. Fty two schools responded as being closed. googletag.cmd.push “It should be noted that figures can fluctuate on a daily basis. Figures collected for the same day the previous week show that there were  children reported as being in open schools. “An interactive map displaying schools open for supervised learning can be accessed on the Education Authority website. This is updated daily.” According to today’s map, April , there are  schools open in Derry and the surrounding area but only three with pupils in attendance - Lisnagelvin P.S., Eglinton P.S. and Broadbridge P.S. Many people were unhappy with delays to school closures in the North. However, based on scientic advice on how to limit spread of the COVID- virus the decision was taken that children who can stay safely at home, should, to limit the chance of the virus spreading. googletag.cmd.push This is dferent in other countries and jurisdictions but is based on sound scientic advice, so that critical services can be maintained and the spread of the virus reduced. Parents and carers were advised to send their child to schoolthere is ‘no other viable option’. For many there is no other option at present, as childcare services have closed and people have been advised against leaving children with grandparents as they are amongst the high risk category. Supervised learning is about providing a facility in schools and pre-schools for vulnerable children and those of key and critical workers to allow parents to continue with their vital jobs.

The deal was first agreed in principle with the five major teaching unions last June, but has now been formally presented to members for approval. Siobhan McElhinney, a member of the union’s Northern Committee, said it has the potential to change the lives of teachers across all sectors. “One of the main selling points is the opportunity of getting the backpay,” she told the County Derry Post. “Members will be backpaid from September  and that is a major selling point. The ask was % and the unions have negotiated .%. That’s not bad in the world of negotiation. googletag.cmd.push “The other big strength is the workload. Beforehand, people negatively on social media were saying these things have been talked about. “They were, but they were never agreed with management and DE . Everybody has now totally supported this workload agreement. “This deal will change people’s lives. It will make a definite improvement to work-le balance for everybody.” The Covid- outbreak has forced the union to use an online poll for what would ordinarily be decided by postal ballot and members have voiced opposition over the timing of the deal. Voting in the poll is currently underway and will continue until Wednesday evening at .pm. googletag.cmd.push Social media posts from INTO encouraging members to approve the deal have prompted criticism, with some members also feeling it doesn’t go far enough to meet their demands. “This deal has been agreed in principle since last June,” said Siobhan. “Other public sector workers had issues and then you had the nurses who really deserved to get theirs sorted out and then we were coming along next. It was always going to be now. “In the south Derry area, we have -odd members and a lot of very, very positive reps in schools. There is a positive vibe, people see it as it is. “There are nine dferent workstreams and six of them are to be acted upon immediately. The Minister and the deal is allowing people to get their house in order and then we look again.” The Maghera native feels the deal provides an opportunity for a realignment in what is expected of teachers within their roles. She said: “The word ‘inspector’ terries people, but ETIhave produced a ‘myth-busting’ document to outline what they are looking for from a school. “Sometimes teachers go beyond what they’re supposed to do, and this [deal] actually asks them to keep in mind from now what they are supposed to be doing. “It’s like a Gaelic player on the football pitch. They play their time and when the whistle is blown, they stop. They don’t go into extra time unless they are asked to. “Teachers keep going beyond what they are supposed to be doing and that’s what causes exhaustion, leaves them shattered within their job and negative towards everything .” Siobhan says approval of the deal would not be the end of the process, but a new beginning and that the union would be working to ensure its benefits impact on their members. She said: “A lot of people are quietly delighted. For a teacher at the top of the main scale, net back pay is going to be in the region of pound,. “There are so many positives in the recognition of trade union movements, consultation on workload. We intend to help members implement it to improve their work-le balance. “If you have happy teachers, you have happy pupils and happy pupils make happy families.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period. Fast forward to the present day and the future looks equally rosy. In recent years, the club were honoured by the IFA as the Club of the Year. “Dungiven Celtic Football has consistently excelled in its work for youth football in the local area,” read part of the response from the judging . “The club’s community work has also been exemplary having successfully managed to build signicant participation in the local area.” After becoming an established club, the award rubber-stamps their commitment to the future “We have come a long way and it can fall apart very quickly,” is the take of Terence McMacken. “It is like any other club, it depends on the people. We are lucky at the moment, we have very good people involved. What we have....one, two or three people couldnt do.” He refers to the parental support and how the club is run very much on the GAA model, for the community and with everyone rowing in behind each other. McMacken refers to other clubs in Dungivens league paying their players, but he is adamant their way is the one that needs to remain. “Theyhave loyalty, that is the big thing. It is hard to get that in soccer. It is a dferent game, there are dferent rules and it is run dferently. “We are playing teams on Saturdays where players are getting paid, where our guys are putting in a fiver to play. It is a thing we think is right.” The money goes towards the running of the club and all the admin fees that are hidden from the eye of a player every Saturday. The underage players all contribute a pound, which helps towards the booking of training facilities. Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed. You are asking them to be part of a club, to sell tickets or whatever, the same as the six-year-olds.” The balls might be flying around Ballyguddin before the season is out, but the chances are they wont as players are kept tucked up at home for the safety of the nation in the facing the coronavirus outbreak. When the action s, the surface will be like a carpet and there will be smiles on the kids faces as they mix with their peers once again. The meeting in Sean ODonnells house was only the beginning. The club has been passed on, with interest. Its in a healthy state. Heres to the next  years.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop.

We went from that point to less than a month later when everyone was fully working from home and set up to work the same way as they can do from the office.ldquoAll our client services have been maintained over the past few weeks. There has been no disruption to our clients whatsoever which means that we can continue to do business and generate revenue.Sinead said the boys are getting used to doing their school work at home but are missing the school routine and their friends.She added: ldquoThis week the boys have got used to this new world we are all now in. Whatrsquos important is that work colleagues are in the same position sothe children do come up behind me in a video call, the guys on the other end are totally understanding as they are experiencing the same challenges.ldquoIrsquom fortunate to work for an employer who understands that we have to be adaptable and flexible as we are trying to home-school and be parent and work all at the same time.Sinead said the recent spell of good weather has been a blessing as her sons are happy to play outside by themselves in the garden.ldquoI try and get as much done as I can during the day so I can clock off to make dinner and spend some time with the children, get them out into the fresh air and do some schoolwork with them where possible, said explained.ldquoWith regards to schoolwork, I probably put myself under pressure for the first week but Irsquove relaxed more as Irsquom not a teacher theyrsquore doing well and Irsquom a busy working mummy. We do the schoolwork and the boys are getting used to school work away from the classroom.ldquoThe school is sending lots of really good material for the boys to do through dferent apps and programs and they have been very user-friendly.While she is working to ensure that her sons are sheltered from knowing just how critical the situation is outside, Sinead realises that they have taken in the changes.ldquoWe went to a supermarket for me to get groceries and they noticed that nearly all the other shops were closed, the car park was nearly empty and I had to queue alone to get in.ldquoThey understood that the world was dferent.Sinead believes that a new era of flexibility, particularly when conducting interviews with candidates over video conferencing may stick with her company when the lockdown is over.She added: ldquoI think we are learning in our organisation is that how effectively you can work from home.

Last year he opened the Acoustic stage at the Glastonbury Festival.He also opened for Snow Patrol in the US, Europe and Asia and stood in as an honorary member of the band when guitarist Johnny McDaid was recovering after surgery.The son of Nuala and John McMullan, who still in Portaferry, Ryan started off performing at a young age, singing in a local band, Purple Road, when he was in his mid-teens.He is now staying at his Belfast home, having made it back from the US last month, just two days before the country closed off its airports.Many of his concerts have had to be postponed, including two nights at the Portico Theatre in Portaferry, now rescheduled to June -, and hisUK and Ireland tour this month. He had also been due to headline his first festival, Vearsai in Donegal, last weekend.Ryanrsquos current single, In A Heartbeat, is on the new EP along with Ruthless Cupid, Some Kind of Perfect and Outcry.He explained: ldquoThese songs reflect a handful of times where it felt like Cupid has been toying with me. Amusing himself by throwing me into situations where Irsquom either out of my depth, hoping for reconciliation, or unable to escape the truth that even at theend, Irsquom still holding on to even the worst of my attempts at love.ldquoIn A Heartbeat was written to sum up a stage I think we all kind of go through sooner or later: the understanding that something that once was, is now no more.But even at the end knowing it still has a hold on you, so much so, that no matter how toxic it is, or how little sense it made, yoursquod still run back to it in a desperate attempt to salvage it.The new single is already going down well with fans as the video has been viewed over , times online.Ryan added: ldquoEverything has been going great for me so far, even without my debut album coming out and that. I donrsquot think that all these tracks will be on my new album when I feel that itrsquos ready to be released.

This has enabled us to expand the nursing and midwery workforce by reaching out to those who have retired or lapsed their registration over the past number of years and provided opportunities for early registration for overseas staff.ldquoI am exceptionally grateful for the excellent response demonstrated by those who have volunteered toto practice and support the professional response to this pandemic.ldquoEach and every new registrant on the emergency register is a very welcome addition to the professional team and the support you will provide will have a signicant impact on outcomes for patients and the multidisciplinary workforce.Mrs McArdle said she wanted to specically thank nursing and midwery students for their ldquovaluable contribution to the delivery of safe, person-centred care as members of the nursing and midwery team.ldquoI recognise that this is an uncertain time causing great anxiety for many of you and your families. The NMC have revised pre-registration programmes and provided students with options to undertake clinical placements in an attempt to expand the nursing and midwery workforce. This approach enables students to continue their educational programme whilst contributing to clinical services during the pandemic. ldquoThe chief nurse also acknowledged the concerns raised over the issue of personal protective equipmentover the past number of weeks, insisting that the safety of frontline staff is of the utmost importance.She said ldquoconcrete action was being taken to ensure the supply of PPE and the safe use of the equipment for all staff caring for patients during the COVID- pandemic.Mrs McArdle said no matter where nurses and midwives are providing care, the use of appropriate PPE must be prioritised.She added: ldquoWhat we are currently experiencing is unprecedented and extraordinarily dficult for everyone. I believe it is important to openly acknowledge that many of us, as nurses and midwives, are frightened and uncertain regarding the impending challenges presented by the COVID- pandemic.ldquoIn order to meet these challenges, as professionals we will need to adopt a flexible approach.

This is the first time this has happened since the foot and mouth outbreak in .There is a possibility of point-to-point bumpers on racecourses when jump racing s and also an expanded autumn season.The national hunt season has ended which means no Irish Grand National on Easter Monday and no Punchestown Festival mdash Irelandrsquos Cheltenham mdash at the end of the month.Gordon Elliott, who had two winners at the recent Downpatrick meeting and who had  horses in training, is now down to , so he has had to cut back on staff.The end of the point-to-point season is a severe blow to local trainers like Paddy Turley, Stuart Crawford, Colin McKeever and Warren Ewing, who produce young horses to sell after running them in four year-old races.I understand that Co Wexford trainer Donnchadh Doyle had  four year-olds ready to make their debuts and there are a lot more trainers in the same boat.When racing resumes it will be all flat racing for a month, so with Downpatrick now only running jump racing it will be some time until locals get back to their favourite venue.With the English jump season also curtailed it is good to know that Newtownhamilton native Brian Hughes, who rode his first ever winner as a flat apprentice for his boss Kevin Prendergast at Downpatrick, has been crownedchampion jockey for the first time, with a total of  wins,  clear of reigning champion Richard Johnston.Sadly this weekrsquos news has seen thousands of horses taken out of training.With the English national hunt season coming to a close earlier than originally planned, itrsquos well done to Ballee native David Maxwell on riding a total of  winners from a total of only  rides. He rides all his own horses.It was also a very good season for another Downpatrick rider, Danny McMenamin, who is attached to the yard of Nicky Richards, for whom Tony Dobbin was stable jockey for many years.Danny, who gets plenty of rides for other yards, rode a fantastic  winners from  rides. He also rode many to finish either second or third during the season.The original fixture list for  is now null and void so the original dates for Downpatrick and Down Royal, when we hopefully get back to normal sooner than later, will be all change to those originally sent out to members.An interesting fact that I learned with interest at the weekend was that Willie Robinson, who rode Laffy to win the  Ulster National at Downpatrick for the Queen Mother, was retained by Major John Corbett of Tyrella to ride for him.This was in the s before he moved to England as stable jockey to Fulke Walwyn. O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

There was no reason for it to come forward until it could be scrutinised properly and to have debate.”DUP Glengormley Councillor Alison Bennington’s objection to the item which was heard in confidence was also recorded.The council has also agreed to identy the supplier and product for the crematorin advance of the finalisation of the design of the facility.by Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter.---A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Letter to the editor : Johnston Press Resell \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I am particularly concerned at the situation at the Port of Larne, which is the shortest sea transport corridor for freight to and from GB.The big picture is that Northern Ireland PLC needs sea connectivity from all its commercial ports, including Warrenpoint, to ensure the safe supply of essential goods, not least medical supplies, which overwhelmingly come from the rest of the UK.I am aware that almost all deliveries of medicines come from GB, and a signicant amount come into Larne. It is very clear to me that the Port of Larne — whose strategic transport importance as a main hub and a gateway is recognised in the Regional Development Strategy — needs some sort of UK national government intervention to secure and maintain operations.A critical level of ferry transport from Northern Ireland to Great Britain must be maintained.The North Channel ferry link is of vital strategic importance for Northern Ireland right now and the Northern Ireland executive needs to be working in partnership with Westminster to secure our ferry routes, maintain operations at the Port of Larne and intervene as necessary to keep vital supply lines between NI, GB, Europe and the rest of the world open.John Stewart MLA, Ulster Unionist economy spokesperson—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
