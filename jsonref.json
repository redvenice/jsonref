People wanted to work on (the pile),\u0027 he said. \u0027There was commonality, a sense of mission.\u0027         Duane Matters told DailyMail.com that celebrities sometimes showed up to Ground Zero during the day. \u0027That\u0027s one of the reasons I went to night shift primarily was because less people. The day shift, people always seemed to show up during the day and they wanted tours or they would try come in and do a little morale rising of workers and things of that nature.\u0027 Work during the night progressed mostly without those type of interruptions, but on November 16, 2001, he said: \u0027I got a call on my radio that said the guys from Aerosmith are here and they wanna see Ground Zero so, you know, I showed up at the gate and gave them a tour.\u0027 Above Steven Tyler, left, and Duane Matters, right         Anthony DePalma, author of City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance, and 911, wrote: \u0027The Twin Towers, built in the early 1970s, contained two tons of asbestos fireproofing that had probably been ripped from the steel beams it was intended to protect. Once loose, the asbestos fibers had spread over Lower Manhattan in the towering dust plume... Much of the dust was composed of cement particles.\u0027 He noted the towers\u0027 110 floors were \u0027each the size of a football field and 4 inches thick.\u0027 Above, an iron workers in the elevator core of what was One World Trade Center in a photo taken on October 18, 2001 at 5:20am         Exposure from toxins on 911 and during the cleanup process has led to more than 2,000 deaths, and an estimated \u002710,000 first responders and others who were in the World Trade Center area have been diagnosed with cancer,\u0027 USA Today reported last year. Experts now predict that more people will died from 911-related illness than from the attack, according to the article.

A geologist by training who has expertise in air sampling and asbestos, he was part of a team that monitored the health and safety plan for the site\u0027s non-uniformed personnel such as iron workers. He also kept track of work flow and equipment, which is why he started taking many of the photos seen above. He reiterated to DailyMail.com that people wanted to be part of the effort at Ground Zero.

Edward, an accomplished cook, rarely wrote down any instructions for, say, his oysters Rockefeller or chicken paillard. While the food we ate was certainly important, the book was not meant to be a cookbook, but instead a memoir about the nature of friendship.In this pursuit, I was inspired by a rich literature of culinary writing in which food is a central motif, but is held together by the story of its preparation and the fellowship that comes from sharing a meal. So many writers – from MFK Fisher, who wrote lyrically about the pleasures of dining alone, to New York chef Gabrielle Hamilton, who documented her hardscrabble upbringing through family meals – use food as a catalyst for memories and loving nostalgia.While I’m still a big fan of a good recipe book – anything by Jamie Oliver, Yotam Ottolenghi and Julia Child – it’s the stories in beautifully rendered memoirs that stay with me longer than any recipe. It’s Nigel Slater using burnt toast as a metaphor for his mother’s love, and Anne Fadiman getting drunk as a teenager when she tries to please her vintage-wine-obsessed father. Below, are what I consider some of the best culinary memoirs.1. The Wine Lover’s Daughter: A Memoir by Anne FadimanFadiman’s most recent book about her father, the American author and radio personality Clifton Fadiman, is a deftly written memoir – a coming-of-age story written around her father’s oenophilia. He was “a lousy driver and a two-finger typist”, she writes, “but he could open a wine bottle as deftly as any swain ever undressed his lover”.2. The Gastronomical Me by MFK FisherMary Frances Kennedy Fisher was ahead of her time. After spending “two shaking and making years in my life” with her new husband in Dijon, she returned to California in the early 1940s where she became a serious food writer. The Gastronomical Me recounts some of her very poetic encounters with food. Here was a woman who loved nothing more than dining alone in a restaurant “as if I were a guest of myself, to be treated with infinite courtesy.”3. Blood, Bones and Butter: The Inadvertent Education of a Reluctant Chef by Gabrielle HamiltonHamilton runs Prune, a jewel of a restaurant in New York’s East Village. She is also a gifted writer who takes you on a journey from her difficult adolescence in rural Pennsylvania to New York’s aptly named neighbourhood Hell’s Kitchen, where she moves after high school before opening her restaurant.4. Home Cooking: A Writer in the Kitchen by Laurie ColwinThe New Yorker writer and Gourmet magazine columnist’s memoir is about the joys of cooking at home. From her tiny Greenwich Village kitchen, she writes about meals shared with friends and family. “I love to eat out, but even more, I love to eat in,” she says. I fell for the ordinary extraordinariness of her stories, the reliance on available resources and implements to create something wonderful. This is what I tried so hard to capture in my own book.5. Consider the Oyster by MFK FisherWH Auden called Fisher “America’s greatest writer”, which is my excuse for choosing a second book by her. It’s easy to see why the poet so admired her, in this slim 1941 volume – an ode to the gastronome’s prize treat. “An oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life,” she begins. Fisher tells you everything you ever wanted to know about this bivalve mollusc and writes brilliantly about such unfamiliar ingredients as Herbsaint.6. My Life in France by Julia Child, with Alex Prud’hommeA great account of the Childs’ life in Paris after the second world war. Working with her grandnephew Alex Prud’homme, the great chef reminisces about meeting her husband Paul in what was still Ceylon while both were working for the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA. When Paul took a job in Paris, Julia immersed herself in French cooking. Her description of eating sole meunière for the first time at a restaurant in Rouen is mouth-watering: “It arrived whole: a large, flat Dover sole that was perfectly browned in a sputtering butter sauce with a sprinkling of chopped parsley on top.”7. Cooking for Mr Latte: A Food Lover’s Courtship With Recipes by Amanda HesserThe “Mr Latte” of the title is the author’s boyfriend, a writer for the highbrow New Yorker who has rather lowbrow tastes in food. Although affable and intelligent, he ends each exquisite meal they share with the fine-dining faux pas of a latte. First told in instalments for the New York Times where Hesser worked as a food writer, this is as much a love letter to New York and food as it is to the man Hesser ends up marrying.8. More Home Cooking: A Writer Returns to the Kitchen by Laurie ColwinSince the subject here concerns appetite, I’m going to recommend a second helping of Colwin. I feel a real kinship to her because I share her obsession with what people eat at home. Written the year Colwin died aged just 50, this is a treatise on the importance of the family dinner – no matter who you consider to be family. “We know that without food we would die,” she writes. “Without fellowship life is not worth living.”9. Talking With My Mouth Full: My Life as a Professional Eater by Gail SimmonsSimmons is a presenterjudge on Bravo’s Top Chef, but she’s also a fellow Canadian who found herself struggling to make it in a tough industry in New York. In this memoir, she writes about growing up in Toronto with a mother who wrote food columns and conducted cooking classes in their suburban home. Simmons’s trial-by-fire in some of the toughest high-end restaurant kitchens in New York City makes for a great read.10. Toast: The Story of a Boy’s Hunger by Nigel SlaterSlater tells the story of his childhood through a catalogue of British sweets – fairy drops and Bluebird milk chocolate toffees – and the culinary failures of his mother. Burnt toast was her specialty. “My mother burns the toast as surely as the sun rises each morning,” writes Slater, who nevertheless longs for blackened bread after she dies and his father marries a woman who is the perfect housewife but very much the evil stepmother.• Dinner With Edward: A Story of an Unexpected Friendship by Isabel Vincent is published by Pushkin.

The board of LSEG will consider this proposal and will make a further announcement in due course.”The company also said it intends to press on with its deal to buy Refinitiv, whose Eikon terminals on trading floors challenge those provided by Bloomberg.“LSEG remains committed to and continues to make good progress on its proposed acquisition of Refinitiv,” the company said. “A circular is expected to be posted to LSEG shareholders in November to seek their approval of the transaction.”If the deal with Refinitiv falls through LSE will have to pay a break fee of £198m. Refinitiv is owned by a consortium led by Blackstone and including Thomson Reuters, which owns the Reuters news service.In 2012, HKEX paid £1.4bn to buy the then 135-year-old London Metal Exchange, the centre for global metals trading, in a deal that transformed the group into a global player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5cdd01100efb444d06791db44c19b9cf42e3be8/0_500_6605_3961/master/6605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca9a3bba8fc88457c79ba7916466cb7","title":"retailers call for action as high street store closures soar","story":"Government urged to step in over crisis that has cost tens of thousands of jobsRetailers and unions are calling for urgent government action to help struggling high streets as new data shows the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty is rising at the fastest pace in nearly a decade.About 16 stores closed their doors every day in the first half of 2019 while only nine opened, resulting in a net decline of 1,234 chain stores on Britain’s top 500 high streets according to analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and high street analysts the Local Data Company (LDC).The decline, which does not include independent shops, was faster than the net 1,123 closures during the same period last year – after just 222 in 2017 – and is the highest recorded since LDC began monitoring high streets in 2010.The shop closure data reflects a crisis on the high street that has cost tens of thousands of jobs. The retail industry employed 57,000 less people in the three months to the end of August compared to the same period a year before, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released on Tuesday. It was the fifth consecutive quarter of decline.Major chains including Karen Millen, Jack Wills, Bathstore, Patisserie Valerie and Debenhams have gone into administration this year after the collapse of House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Maplin and Poundworld in 2018. Some of those chains are still in business, taken over by new operators after their collapse, but have closed outlets.Many other retailers, including Topshop owner Arcadia, Monsoon, New Look, Carpetright and Homebase have been forced to seek legal agreements with their landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills to stave off insolvency.“The government must address the growing crisis on our high streets,” said Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the shopworkers union Usdaw, which has launched a Save our Shops petition.Usdaw, and some of the UK’s biggest retailers including Tesco and Sainsburys, have demanded a review of business rates and other taxes to ensure there is a level playing field with online rivals. Last month, more than 50 major UK retailers, ranging from Marks \u0026amp Spencer to Harrods, Greggs and John Lewis wrote to chancellor Sajid Javid to demand an urgent review of business rates to safeguard the high street.Usdaw also wants better support for communities and a minimum wage of £10 an hour to help protect 4.5m jobs in the retail sector.The government recently increased its high street rescue fund by £325m to £1bn, promising to pump extra money into 100 towns including Blackpool, Scarborough and Clacton. It has also announced £900m in business rates relief for small retailers and a taskforce of experts to assist local authorities in developing “innovative strategies to help high streets evolve”.But retailers say a complete overhaul of property taxes is required to help fend off competition from online-only operators such as Amazon and Asos.“High streets are undergoing a fundamental change in response to changing shopping habits, new technologies and rising costs of doing business, so it is vital that government supports the industry to make the necessary investment to adapt,” said Dr Liliana Danila, economist at the British Retail Consortium.“The business rate system holds back investment, reduces productivity and increases regional disparities … The government must address the much-needed reforms to this broken tax system before more jobs are lost and stores are closed.”Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, unseasonably warm weather, rising costs and broader economic problems. In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.\u0026nbspAt the same time, there is a move away from buying ‘stuff’ as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.In the October 2018 budget the government announced\u0026nbspsome relief\u0026nbspon business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a £675m ‘future high streets’ fund under which local councils can bid for up to £25m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas – which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come – retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.Retail chains have been hit by a mix of low consumer confidence, which has cut spending, and rising costs from business rates, an increase in the legal minimum wage, and higher cost prices as a result of the decline in the value of the pound since the EU referendum.The rise of online shopping and a shift in how consumers spend their leisure time – towards spending more of their spare cash on holidays and dining and drinking at home – have also hit high streets and shopping malls.Fashion chains were hardest hit in the first six months of this year, with a net decline of 118 stores as chains such as New Look, LK Bennett, and Yorkshire-based menswear specialist Greenwoods either restructured or went bust, according to the PwCLDC study.Restaurants, estate agents, pubs and bars also registered substantial numbers of closures.“There’s been no let-up in the changing ways that people shop and the cost pressures affecting high street operators,” said Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC. “As consumers continue to change the way they shop and spend their leisure time, the reality is that we may need fewer high streets in the future.”There are some high street success stories. Takeaways, health clubs, pet shops and discount stores are the fastest growing outlets.A similar decline in store numbers is expected in the second half of 2019 as recently approved restructurign deals, including Topshop and Dorothy Perkins owner Arcadia, are implemented. Hooker said there could be greater stability next year “subject to world economics and politics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2716b33f1ac8ef76665f02a69507d3898bbe8267/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22aeaec4595d1f8a10249a0e1e15cea8","title":"sports direct mike ashley a third investors vote against re electing mike ashley","story":"Decision by independent shareholders comes as retailer admits it has no auditorNearly a third of independent investors have voted against the re-election of Mike Ashley as the chief executive of Sports Direct amid criticism of the company’s poor corporate governance.Thornton stepped down after the apparent fallout over the retailer’s chaotic annual results announcement in July. After more than 10 hours of delays, the company said it could not issue profit guidance for the year ahead after receiving an unexpected €674m (£605m) Belgian tax bill.The finance director, Chris Wootton, said on Wednesday that Sports Direct was going through a process to appoint a new auditor but did not indicate how long it would take.Under the Companies Act, Sports Direct will have to formally notify the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, within a week that it has failed to appoint an auditor. Leadsom has the power to appoint an auditor if and when all other efforts to do so have been exhausted. It is not clear whether she will step in but as a listed company Sports Direct must have an auditor in place by the time of its interim results announcement on 12 December.Ashley said he paid close attention to the accounts to ensure they were “simple and conservative” as the majority of his personal wealth was tied up in the company.Ashley said the company was unlikely to pay a idend for years to come while it invested in improving House of Fraser and Sports Direct stores.He said the future of the company relied on moving away from “pile it high, sell it cheap” towards elevation with outlets similar to a converted BHS in Leicester, which includes a Sports Direct alongside the group’s upmarket Flannels store and streetwear outlet USC.“It’s happening, it’s coming, it’s just not as fast as I would like it,” Ashley said. “I would like to click my fingers and have 100 Leicesters tomorrow … God do they take some money,” he said.However, in an eccentric outburst, Ashley told shareholders not to buy anything in the Flannels store downstairs from the annual meeting on London’s Oxford Street. “It’s eye-watering what some of the prices are for a pair of shoes or a cap,” he said.John Gray from the Local Authority Pension Funds forum, which represents about £100m of shares in Sports Direct, criticised the company for rejecting its call for an independent review of corporate governance and ignoring requests for a meeting.Gray asked: “Can you explain why you have found it difficult to get an auditor and non-executive directors with relevant experience?” Bottomley told about 15 shareholders who attended the meeting that there had been no argument” with Thornton but Sports Direct had been disappointed at the delay with its results. Thornton was under close scrutiny by the accounting regulator as it was already under investigation over Sports Direct’s failure to disclose a transaction with a company owned by Ashley’s brother.Wootton said Sports Direct had “total confidence in our numbers”.“Media likes to sensationalise this kind of thing. We are going through a process. We account for stuff conservatively, consistently and simply,” he said.He added that Sports Direct had met more than once with the Belgian tax authorities to discuss its hefty bill and continued to believe it was “less than probable to be a material liability”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a241e3d1059c7cf48dd08f9a90540bbf5de6104a/0_0_1483_890/master/1483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94bd3fcfcf9607bf8d8fa8a719e275a9","title":"irrelevant panel pours scorn over googles ideas for toronto smart city","story":"Independent report criticises Sidewalk Labs over ‘frustratingly abstract’ proposals for new tech-oriented neighbourhoodA controversial smart city development in Canada has hit another roadblock after an oversight panel called key aspects of the proposal “irrelevant”, “unnecessary” and “frustratingly abstract” in a new report.The project on Toronto’s waterfront, dubbed Quayside, is a partnership between the city and Google’s sister company Sidewalk Labs. It promises “raincoats” for buildings, autonomous vehicles and cutting-edge wood-frame towers, but has faced numerous criticisms in recent months.The latest critique comes with just over a month to go before the city decides to approve or reject the project. It was prepared by the Digital Strategy Advisory Panel, an arms-length group that advises Waterfront Toronto, which oversees the sprawling development.The group of technology experts called the master plan “somewhat unwieldy and repetitive” in the 99-page document released Tuesday.Panelists also felt that certain innovations were “irrelevant or unnecessary”.For months, critics have pointed to the project’s numerous ambiguities, largely around the prospect of mass data collection.“The smart city project on the Toronto waterfront is the most highly evolved version to date of … surveillance capitalism,” said American investor Roger McNamee in a June letter to Toronto city council, in which he called for the project to be scrapped.For its part, Sidewalk Labs has worked to counter fears that data will be shared with third parties, instead advocating for a “data trust” to protect sensitive information.In mid-June, however, Sidewalk Labs stirred controversy again when it presented its 1,500-page master plan. Waterfront Toronto had initially asked for 12 acres of development, but the Google affiliate instead presented a vision for 190 acres of prime waterfront land.This week’s report expressed concerns over integrating the project into pre-existing infrastructure, and also took issue with the format of the master plan itself.“The document lacks a detailed table of contents, an index, clickable links within endnotes, a consolidated and searchable version, or a non-pdf online version,” said panelists, which they claimed called into question Sidewalk Labs’ commitment to usability and accessibility.While the report is a collection of preliminary comments and not a formal criticism, it suggests a number of concerns remain. Representatives from Sidewalk Labs will meet with the panel on Thursday to discuss the issues raised in the report.Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs have until 31 October to iron out differences in order for the project to win approval.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea7d7ba5f2c584b00ce8ac39e880b62a2f1f358/0_144_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afce6a184d1899418ed33de2d517510b","title":"brexit ultras triumph neoliberalism","story":"At first sight it’s incomprehensible. Why risk everything for a no-deal Brexit? Breaking up their own party, losing their parliamentary majority, dismantling the UK, trashing the economy, triggering shortages of food and medicine: how could any objective, for the Conservative and Unionist party, be worth this? What good does it do them?Yes, some people will benefit. To judge by recent donations to the Conservative party, some very rich people approve of Boris Johnson’s policies. A no-deal Brexit might favour hedge funds that thrive on uncertainty, financiers seeking to short the pound, vulture capitalists hoping to mop up cheap property if markets collapse. But the winners are likely to be greatly outnumbered by the losers, among whom are many powerful commercial interests.We make a mistake when we assume that money is the main motivation. Our unreformed, corrupt and corrupting political funding system ensures it is an important factor. But what counts above all else is ideology, as ideology successfully pursued is the means to power. You cannot exercise true power over other people unless you can shape the way they think, and shape their behaviour on the basis of that thought. The long-term interests of ideology differ from the short-term interests of politics.This, I believe, is the key to understanding what is happening today. The Brexit ultras in government are not just Brexit ultras. They are neoliberal ultras, and Brexit is a highly effective means of promoting this failed ideology. It’s the ultimate shock doctrine, using a public emergency to justify the imposition of policies that wouldn’t be accepted in ordinary times. Whether they really want no deal or not, the threat of it creates the political space in which they can apply their ideas.Neoliberalism is the ideology developed by people such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. It is not just a set of free-market ideas, but a focused discipline, deliberately applied around the world. It treats competition as humanity’s defining characteristic, sees citizens as consumers and “the market” as society’s organising principle. The market, it claims, sorts us into a natural hierarchy of winners and losers. Any attempt by politics to intervene disrupts the discovery of this natural order.It was embraced by Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and most subsequent governments. They sought to implement the doctrine by cutting taxes, privatising and outsourcing public services, slashing public protections, crushing trade unions and creating markets where markets did not exist before. The doctrine was imposed by central banks, the IMF, the Maastricht treaty and the World Trade Organization. By shutting down political choice, governments and international bodies created a kind of totalitarian capitalism.It has failed on its own terms, and in many other ways. Far from creating general prosperity, growth has been slower in the neoliberal era than it was in preceding decades, and most of its fruits have been gathered by the rich. Far from stimulating an enterprise economy, it has created a gilded age for rent-seekers. Far from eliminating bureaucracy, it has created a Kafkaesque system of mad diktats and stifling control. It has fomented ecological, social, political, economic and financial crises, culminating in the 2008 crash. Yet, perhaps because its opponents have not produced a new, compelling story of their own, it still dominates our lives.Unsurprisingly, people have reacted to the closure of political choice and the multiple disasters it caused. But because neoliberalism, in broad terms, was adopted not only by the right, but also by the Democrats, New Labour and similar parties, there were few places to turn. Many people responded with nationalism and nativism. The new politics that Boris Johnson’s government represents incorporates both neoliberalism and the reaction to it. The glitter-eyed essentialists on the frontbenches – such as Dominic Raab, Liz Truss and Sajid Javid – still seek to implement the ideology in its most extreme form. The opportunists, such as Johnson, Michael Gove and Priti Patel, appeal to those who seek scapegoats for the disasters it has created.Johnson uses neoliberal framing to justify his attacks on public safety. He wants to pull down environmental standards, create free ports in which businesses can avoid tax and regulation, and strike a rapid trade deal with the United States that is likely to rip up animal welfare rules and threaten the survival of the NHS.He rages against red tape, but the real red tape is created by the international trade treaties he favours, that render democratic change almost impossible, through rules that protect capital against popular challenge, and shift decision-making away from parliaments and into unaccountable offshore courts (“investor-state dispute settlement”). This explains the enthusiasm among some on the left for Brexit: a belief that escaping from the EU means escaping from coercive trade instruments. In reality, it exposes us to something even worse, as the UK enters negotiations with the US, holding a begging bowl.Now, as the professor of political economy Abby Innes argues, neoliberalism has reached its Brezhnev phase: “ossification, self-dealing, and directionless political churn”. Like Leninism, neoliberalism claims to be an infallible science. Its collision with the complexities of the real world has caused political sclerosis of the kind that characterised the decline of Soviet communism. As a result, “the only way to complete this revolution today is under cover of other projects: Brexit is ideal”.The creation of emergency is the inevitable destination of an absolutist, failed system. But emergency also provides the last means by which the failed system can be defended and extended."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f294a5a8e065e3088fb2f319f0bab2b383bae734/0_138_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e67740c44f12485261742de8bf4018ed","title":"john bolton path destruction","story":"Washington DC’s most famous warmonger might have lost his job, but this probably won’t be the last we hear of BoltonOur long international nightmare of John Bolton is over. For now.Did Bolton resign? Was he fired? It doesn’t matter. John Bolton is now no longer in charge of US national security policy and thus, we can all breathe a little easier.Indeed, Bolton’s top priority has always been to go to war with Iran. One of the biggest concerns among those of us who understand that going to war with Iran is a bad idea was that Bolton, an experienced bureaucrat, would take advantage of a naive commander-in-chief and use innocuous enough policy decisions to slow-walk Donald Trump into a corner where war was the only way out.Bolton – who has made a career of scuttling arms control agreements – also had his sights on cancelling the Obama-era New Start Treaty, an agreement between the US and Russia that placed limits on the number of deployed nuclear warheads, missiles, bombers and launchers.Bolton has spent the better part of his tenure in the Trump administration disparaging the treaty, repeatedly signaling that the US wouldn’t put much effort toward renewing it before it expires in February 2021.But while our collective outlook going forward is promising without Bolton anywhere near the levers of power, the trail of flames he has left behind will have lasting damage.Yes he wasn’t successful in convincing Trump to attack Iran, but Bolton helped create the conditions for war by pushing Trump to finally withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal mere weeks after assuming the top national security job. As predicted (even by the CIA), that policy has turned out to be a complete disaster, with the US isolated from its European allies, Iran’s nuclear program less constrained, and the Trump administration failing miserably in its quest to rein in Iran’s nefarious regional behavior or to spark internal strife toward the regime.And even though Bolton’s departure gives New Start a new lease on life, he convinced Trump to ditch diplomatic efforts at saving the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and instead shepherded a US withdrawal, which officially went into effect last month. Experts are already citing the move as the catalyst for a renewed cold war-esque arms race.Mere months before joining the Trump administration, Bolton attempted to make a legal argument for an unprovoked first strike on North Korea, and he made sure to preserve that option by standing in the way of Trump’s diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions (Trump himself created) with Kim Jong-un. Bolton’s efforts became so intrusive that Trump apparently banished him to Mongolia when he decided to pay a visit to Kim at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.It’s unclear whether we will be able to reverse Bolton’s path of destruction, as it probably also depends on whether Trump wins the presidential election again.But the tragic subplot to the Trump-era Bolton debacle is the persistence of the constant revolving door of failure in Washington that is fueled by deep pockets and an insider media environment that is incapable of holding anyone to account.Bolton’s disastrous ideas have been thoroughly discredited and his political and policy career should have been cast aside long ago, perhaps even after the Senate declined to bless his nomination as US ambassador to the United Nations back in 2005 because of his extremist views.But instead, his post-Bush administration career flourished, presiding over a grotesquely anti-Muslim “thinktank” landing a lucrative gig as a Fox News contributor regularly calling for war on the op-ed pages of, for example, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times generally hanging around Washington undeterred from, as Media Matters put it, establishing “a record of warmongering, bigotry and pushing conspiracy theories” and then ultimately becoming one of the most powerful national security officials in the US government.It’s likely then that we have not heard the last of John Bolton. He will probably return to Fox News or the rightwing machine will give him piles of cash to continue his quest to kill American diplomacy, and perhaps even run for president."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d912397c54ae92fb30e0b6012966b7fa4f0f5f8b/0_131_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa07fa52e9e0586a48cd10e97057bbc5","title":"margaret atwood feminist the testaments","story":"In these dark and difficult political times, I often find myself craving clarity, looking for explanations and reassurances – and rarely, if ever, finding what I seek. When I got my hands on a precious copy of Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments a couple of days ago I was surprised by the almost physical hunger I felt to step back into Gilead. Obviously, I’m not alone, and one reason why this dystopia has hit the spot for many of us is its clarity. I’m not saying that there isn’t complexity of plot in Atwood’s creation, but in Gilead there is also a great deal of moral certainty. There is good, and there is evil. There is oppression, and there is resistance.The appearance of handmaids in their red cloaks has put heart into me at various protests over the past couple of years. I have photographed them at women’s marches in London and seen them gather in courtrooms in the US. Although they are a symbol of a possibly terrifying future, they are also a symbol of shared understanding, which gives me hope. And The Testaments, unlike The Handmaid’s Tale itself, is a truly hopeful tale. It reassures us that we are right to fear our enemies and right to resist them, and it reassures us that totalitarianism can be seen off.This second novel provides even more of this hopefulness, because it is about the resistance to Gilead. We saw seeds of resistance in The Handmaid’s Tale, but they were constantly being smothered or ripped out. Here, we learn how they have taken root – including in some unexpected places. The Testaments is a more accessible novel than The Handmaid’s Tale, sharing some of the tone of the spin-off television series, which necessarily tended to replace introspection with action. These heroines are marvellously resourceful, almost superhuman in their bravery, able to live undercover for years, oversee underground networks, slip across borders, mastermind spy rings, manipulate colleagues, fell enemies with a blow.There is little, here, of the quotidian ordinariness of much political resistance, which can so often turn out to be disappointingly humdrum and compromised. It is massively satisfying to find this kind of heightened reality in fiction, to see the world in an exaggerated mode, the patterns standing out so much more clearly than in the one in which we live.Even though in these resonant books she creates such a stark political vision, it’s intriguing that Atwood has nevertheless been keen to say that she is not writing a manifesto. She has often pushed back in interviews, when asked about her relationship to feminism, against the idea that she will provide “a megaphone for any one particular set of beliefs”. As she wrote in the New York Times in 2017: “Is The Handmaid’s Tale a ‘feminist’ novel? If you mean an ideological tract in which all women are angels andor so victimized they are incapable of moral choice, no.”It is hardly surprising that a writer of such inventive fiction would be nervous of the idea that her work could be pigeonholed into any ideological framework. There is a fear among many female writers and film-makers that to call your work feminist means to curtail its imaginative impact and suggest it should be read as propaganda. This is the same conception of feminist fiction that was so powerfully rejected by another great writer, the late Doris Lessing, whose work was also often claimed for the feminist movement. In 1982 she trenchantly told an interviewer: “What the feminists want of me is something they haven’t examined because it comes from religion. They want me to bear witness. What they would really like me to say is, ‘Ha, sisters, I stand with you side by side in your struggle toward the golden dawn where all those beastly men are no more.’ Do they really want people to make oversimplified statements about men and women? In fact, they do.”Eighteen years ago I had a little exchange with Lessing about her view of feminism. She wrote to me to clarify reports of comments she had made about men and women, but also to double down on her disappointment with the women’s movement, which she said expended too much of its “wonderful energy” in rubbishing men. In my response, I conceded that I should probably stop calling her a feminist. “Perhaps I am wrong to call you a feminist,” I wrote. “It’s silly to stick a label on you that you wouldn’t choose yourself.”I had forgotten about that exchange over the years, but was recently reminded of it by the University of East Anglia, where the letters will be going on display in a new exhibition (Doris Lessing 100, which is opening this week).But when I reread these letters, I realised that despite my concession in 2001, I still see Lessing’s fiction as deeply feminist. Because whenever I dip back into Lessing’s work, particularly The Golden Notebook, the Children of Violence series or her memoirs, I cannot but remember how important she was to the growth of my and other women’s feminism. Without Anna Wulf or Martha Quest and their fiercely uncompromising relationships with their own bodies and their partners, it’s almost impossible to imagine the kind of wry, honest, explicit fiction by women we now take for granted. These heroines killed off the “Angel in the House” that Virginia Woolf complained about, and revealed women in their full, often dislikable, but utterly mesmerising humanity.Lessing’s heroines are too complicated to be easily understood, and they struggle to understand themselves. Their sexual and family relationships are messy and challenging, and their political activity provides no easy journey either, but is fraught and compromised. And that lack of clarity, in itself, is feminist.Because feminism is partly just about finding ways to express women’s full humanity and refusing to accept frames that may flatten our experiences. Feminist fiction is not just about making our political world clearer and simpler. It is not just about providing us with reassurance that we are on the side of the good. We see that complexity time and again in Atwood’s fiction too, even if the popular conception of Gilead, especially the way it has been disseminated through political protest and the television series, has often flattened it out for us. The television series in particular sometimes began to feel as if it was trying to bludgeon us with its lessons about the violence of misogynist oppression.And Atwood too sees her work as feminist in this way. She went on to write about whether The Handmaid’s Tale was feminist: “If you mean a novel in which women are human beings – with all the variety of character and behavior that implies – and are also interesting and important, and what happens to them is crucial to the theme, structure and plot of the book, then yes.”Then, yes. This is the view of feminist fiction that is most valuable. A political novel is not necessarily one that gives you a manifesto, but one that enables you to expand your political understanding of a messy and difficult world. Which is why I would say that there is at least one other important feminist novel on the Booker shortlist alongside Atwood’s. Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other gives the reader no roadmap for resistance, no advice, no clarification. But by knitting together the lives of a erse set of women, what it does do is explore the experiences and listen to the voices that we need to hear from – and often comes back with uncomfortable and urgent news. Some of her heroines succeed by compromise and some by resistance some live out lies and some insist on the truth, some make their own narratives and some are overcome by others’ needs. For this white reader, this kind of tapestry reminds us of how often black women’s full humanity is skimmed over. This novel shifts our perspectives it complicates our worldview.For me, the most vital political fiction is fiction that makes us feel the irreducible humanity of those who are constantly being forgotten. At a time when empathy often seems to be contracting, when political views admit less and less nuance, let’s not be afraid of complexity. There are no easy answers in our real or imaginary worlds, and let’s not pretend that there ever will be.• Natasha Walter is director of Women for Refugee Women and author of Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cba1e6a7dbcf1d38451512a14b86a432427ab165/1904_1254_3597_2158/master/3597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2424122e04ce01d93981c713034f2024","title":"what a boster black country on film caitlin moran adrian chiles","story":"My finely tuned West Midlands ears pricked up this week at word of the California actress Beanie Feldstein working in a shop in Wolverhampton in order to learn the Black Country dialect. It was research for her role in the film adaptation of Caitlin Moran’s How to Build a Girl. While I simply can’t believe there is no British actor suitable for the role of Caitlin Moran, it’s great that Feldstein is a) making the effort to do the thing properly and b) going to get the difference between the Black Country and Birmingham accents, which is not really understood anywhere more than 30 miles from, say, Cradley Heath.I’m delighted we are going to hear words such as “bostin’” on the big screen (if it doesn’t appear in the film of Moran’s book, I’ll be livid, as I expect Moran would be). Bostin means great, derived, I have always assumed, from bursting, as in something so great it’s bursting out of itself. The associated noun is “boster”, as in “what a boster that goal was!” Many moons ago, I taught English to Spanish kids in Rickmansworth, of all places. I well remember them shooting down a water slide yelling “What a boster!” at me.Confusingly, “bost” is also how you say bust or broken. When I was at university in London, a friend of mine, a Black Country blues singer and harmonica player called Big Jim Merris, came visiting. There was an old jukebox in the union bar, which an extravagantly posh boy called Max was struggling with. Jim said to him: “Oh you won’t get no joy out of that mate it’s bost.” Max edged away from us, possibly a little frightened.Furthermore, instead of saying “she is”, for some reason we say “her is”, hence something like: “Her’s a boster, her is.” When I say “we”, by the way, I don’t really mean me. Although when I first came to work at the BBC I am sure they thought they had a bit of proper Black Country rough. But the truth is I would be regarded as rather posh in these parts, being raised in Hagley, which is where Brummies and Black Country folk came to live when they did well for themselves.To be honest, as a kid I wasn’t really fully across the proper lingo. In a school football match I was somewhat aghast when a lad I was marking from the (to us) scary Grange school in Stourbridge inquired: “Am yow in the district league? We am.” Best not upset him, I thought.Anyway, I salute Moran and Feldstein for putting we (yes “we” not “us”) on the map. We am most grateful.

Their absence will be keenly feltReaders of women’s magazines have had a rough few years. Every few months another titan falls and today we are mourning the UK print edition of Marie Claire, which at 31 has had its life cut short by the prolific killer, “social media”. Its other victims include Lucky, More!, Look and InStyle UK. Marie Claire will live on in the digital afterlife (and in print in other markets where it continues to be published, such as Australia, France and the US), alongside Glamour, which went digital first in 2017, cutting its print edition to twice a year.The demise of women’s mags would once have been met with jubilation by some feminists. Although they were a space for women in the media, they were often a toxic one: the circling of celebrity cellulite, the reinforcement of white beauty standards, the endless sex tips focused on every orgasm but your own, only further entrenched misogyny. But, by and large, this is not a representation of women’s magazines today. The closure of Teen Vogue’s print publication was met with widespread outrage, after we had watched the magazine mature into a politically engaged tome for pubescent readers who cared about fashion, but also wanted to ensure that the climate crisis hadn’t scorched the world in which it could exist.Although glossy magazines are the worst affected, online women’s publications have not escaped – the Debrief and the Pool (where I was once a senior writer) suffered the same fate. The closure of Lena Dunham’s email-based Lenny Letter showed that even a famous CEO and acclaimed writers couldn’t ensure a publication’s longevity.The sad thing is that the current purge is happening at a time when women’s magazines are less sexist and more progressive than they ever have been. Last year’s September issues made history with virtually every one featuring a black cover star. Some may argue that change came too late, but even magazines that only ever had a feminist agenda haven’t been immune – websites such as Rookie, the Toast and the Hairpin no longer exist. Quick-witted British iterations such as Standard Issue and Motherland have also folded (though Standard Issue has continued to flourish as a podcast).What is happening to women’s magazines is simply a reflection of an industry-wide problem. But in a media landscape that tends to characterise interests generally associated with men as “news” while women’s issues are often shoehorned into “lifestyle” pullouts and supplements, their absence is keenly felt and their presence still very much needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27c0d403fc8124f483069b66ec0bd5383ce60829/0_645_5597_3359/master/5597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d85d2dfb2ed087e50102bd98e2ab7cc","title":"cocktails culture and craft beer a locals guide to canadas halifax and neighbouring regions","story":"The secret is out.

The city is home to seven universities, and it’s got the youthful spirit to prove it. Breweries, cafes, live music and general levity can be found around every corner. Here are a few neighbourhoods and nearby regions that visitors shouldn’t miss to get a true taste of Canada’s most playful port city, a destination that’s only a six-hour flight from the UK.One of the city’s oldest neighbourhoods, the North End has been revived and transformed of late. The streets are an eclectic mix of colourful saltbox houses, old industrial warehouses and hip restaurants serving up craft beer, local wines and creative fare.For a casual afternoon pint in the summer, there’s nowhere better than the patio at Good Robot Brewing Company, where there is a rotating cast of all-star brews on the go and the vibe is always friendly and fun. The small but funky 2 Crows Brewing Co also has 12 taps and a brand new reveal every Saturday. Bar manager Mitch Gilbert recommends the Pollyanna Wild Northeast IPA, a juicy, tropical, bitter IPA that’s been flying off the shelves.“We propagate and grow our own yeast grains,” says Gilbert. “Then we add fruits sourced from Nova Scotia and malt from neighbouring Prince Edward Island. The results yield a quite extensive selection of barrel-aged beers.”For an unforgettable brunch, check out Edna, the bright and airy neighbourhood favourite, full of foraged wildflowers, a wide selection of beers and ciders, and some of the city’s best steaks, burgers and seafood. Later in the day, visit Field Guide – it’s just across the way and the perfect place to start off an evening. Try exquisitely crafted cocktails while enjoying the sharing menu that changes according to season.Popular with visitors and locals alike, Bar Kismet will complete your visit to Halifax, but you’ll need to book ahead or queue. Recently voted the 15th best restaurant in all of Canada, Bar Kismet gets everything right, nailing famous east-coast hospitality with stylish minimalism and exceptional seafood dishes. Award-winning bartender Cooper Tarel recommends the signature cocktail, Return of the Sumac, paired with the popular appetiser ahi tartare and allumettes fries.Finally, the hidden gem Water and Bone offers up rotating taps of all-local ciders and beers, excellent happy-hour specials, a sweet back patio and insanely popular noodle bowls (with house-made noodles).Citadel Hill strategically overlooks Halifax harbour and is what enticed the British military here in 1749. It’s worth a visit, and not only for the view from the top. From there, head downtown, stopping for a stroll in the Public Gardens. Don’t miss the amazing Halifax Central Library, a cultural hub with award-winning architecture and two excellent cafes inside.Head to Argyle Street for a bite or a pint or two after a day of exploring the city. The strip is one of Halifax’s nightlife hubs, where patios line both sides of the pedestrian-only zone. East of Grafton has a lovely little outdoor terrace that’s popular for lunch and alfresco dinner in the warmer months. Farther down, the elegant Lot Six stands out when it comes to local seafood dishes and cocktails, while The Five Fishermen offers up inspired seafood with an upscale casual atmosphere.For traditional east-coast nightlife, try Durty Nelly’s, while the Carleton is a must for live music in a cosy, friendly atmosphere.On the waterfront, a favourite place for a dinner date is The Bicycle Thief. Think incredible house-made pasta tossed with melt in your mouth scallops, sublime red wine and candlelit tables right beside the water. For afternoon pints by the water check out the Stubborn Goat Beer Garden where, as they say, beer tastes better by the ocean.Once at the Halifax waterfront, it’s easy to catch the ferry across the harbour to downtown Dartmouth, which is developing its own hip little collection of bars and restaurants. Heading up the local favourites is the wildly popular Canteen, conveniently located only steps away from the ferry terminal. There’s also the casual Battery Park, offering a slew of craft beers and home to Ace Burger Co, voted the best burgers in Halifax for several years running. For coffee, hit up Two If By Sea, the bright and friendly neighbourhood cafe that’s next door.Visitors to Halifax should also consider a trip to Nova Scotia’s wine country – it’s just an hour from the city. Leading the way is Lightfoot \u0026amp Wolfville Vineyards, a biodynamic, organic winery with strong Acadian roots. Owner Rachel Lightfoot’s family has been farming in the valley for eight generations, creating German-style wines including riesling and pinot noir.“For us, being in tune with the land means being constantly connected to the past and future generations,” she says. Lightfoot recommends trying their bestseller, the Terroir Series Scheurebe. “Nova Scotia’s ocean-influenced cool climate provides freshness and energy, melding with the inherent aromatic intensity of the scheurebe grape to create a truly unique wine,” she says.Another notable favourite is Luckett Vineyards. Pete Luckett is a transplanted Brit who emigrated to Nova Scotia and became a local celebrity. The restaurant is highly recommended, especially the charcuterie board. For beer lovers, Church Brewing Company offers an exceptional collection of craft beers and ciders and locally sourced hearty meals.The area surrounding Tatamagouche boasts several beaches, and because the Trans Canada Trail runs through it, visitors can walk, bike or run their way through town. The village, just under two hours from Halifax by car, is also home to the popular Tatamagouche Brewing Co. The brewery is inside the former village library, bought and reinvented by local craft beer enthusiast Christiane Jost.“The great thing about the beer scene here is that breweries are in every corner of this province,” she says. “We offer world-class beer with unique twists, using local ingredients.”Jost also recommends local restaurants Train Station Inn and the North Shore Diner. “They are both open seasonally, and create fresh food that showcases our local produce,” she says.The idyllic seaside villages of Mahone Bay, Peggy’s Cove, Chester and Old Town Lunenburg, a Unesco world heritage site, make up the south shore, and a scenic coastal drive to visit all four is one of the highlights of a visit to the region. For a self-guided tour, rent a car and enjoy the drive at your leisure, exploring the colourful seaside towns along the way. The area is peppered with local cafes, galleries and boutique shops, perfect for random stops. Over the years, there has also been a surge of creative cuisine along the route, focusing on fresh seafood, seasonal greens and berries, and of course, ciders and beer.Try starting out at The Barn in Mahone Bay or No9 Coffee Bar in Lunenburg for excellent food, coffee and ambience. For something more substantial, check out Grand Banker Bar and Grill for the famous Lunenburger, six ounces of local ground beef, topped with smoked mozzarella and bacon, spinach, Nova Scotia lobster and a bacon-wrapped scallop. If you still have room, check out the Grand Banker’s sister property Shipwright Brewing Company, for some more craft beer sampling.Start planning a trip to explore Halifax and its surrounds with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15960b11ab7dc853a8f55f673398823ff7f136bc/0_115_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d384fc385035c1e0c97eb375f4cd244b","title":"student visa rethink aims to please both business and brexiters","story":"Economic considerations appear to have won out over desire to slash migrationOn the roadmap to post-Brexit Britain, Boris Johnson offering overseas students more time to find a job in the country after they graduate attempts to hit on a compromise: between the demands of business to attract workers and the demands of many Brexit voters for migration to fall.Economic considerations appear to have won out.Universities had been applying significant pressure, warning that Theresa May’s tougher rules would inflict severe damage on a sector where Britain is a genuine world leader. Businesses argued that graduates would head elsewhere, to fill roles from low-skilled retail jobs to high-flying finance and tech startups.According to the lobby group Universities UK, enticing the 460,000 overseas students to Britain – including 140,000 from the EU – supports almost a million jobs and brings in £26bn a year for the economy. Under the market-driven changes introduced by the coalition government, some universities have become dependent on the higher fees paid by international students.May’s tough stance made little sense when her own trade ministers wanted to increase overseas student numbers to as many as 600,000 by 2030.Britain also taps into soft power from hosting migrant students that is difficult to quantify. A British degree is a mark of distinction. About 60 heads of government and state around the world were educated in Britain, and not just at Oxbridge: four studied at Manchester, while others went to Bristol, Brentford and Cardiff.Opening up the country to student migration could also be key for new trade deals, including with nations such as India, which sends significantly fewer students to Britain than China does. .Johnson has been aided by softening attitudes on migration since the Brexit vote, as the economic and cultural benefits have been spelled out in greater detail.The Migration Advisory Committee put paid to the notion that EU migrants drive down wages, drive up crime, bleed the welfare state dry and rob British jobs. In contradiction to the tabloid rhetoric, Oxford Economics reckons EU migrants contribute about £2,300 more to the public purse each year than the average adult.There are some potential drawbacks. Britain has a higher proportion of graduates in non-graduate jobs than average for a wealthy nation, while a third of migrant workers in the UK are also overqualified for their jobs.However, overseas students typically forge lasting ties that stick with them throughout their careers. Ministers will hope the visa extension strengthens those bonds, supporting the economy, when Brexit might otherwise damage them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd5e2a0079aa6967e89d4e686f5029460774b81/0_254_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=820becfffee664f3b04ec93728757078","title":"uk universities welcome u turn on student visas","story":"Higher education sector applauds reversal of Theresa May’s immigration policyThe UK government’s announcement of its plans to offer extended post-study work visas for international graduates of UK universities has received an unusual response –unalloyed praise from the higher education sector.The decision reverses one of the most contentious policies from Theresa May’s time in charge of immigration policy, which shrank the time available for overseas students to stay and work after graduating from two years to as little as four months in most cases.For vice-chancellors gathering for the Universities UK annual conference in Birmingham this week, the reversal was greeted as a victory after seven years of lobbying for a more relaxed stance, allowing Britain to compete more effectively against the likes of Canada in attracting students.“A piece of good news for a change!” tweeted Shearer West, the vice-chancellor of the University of Nottingham, echoing the thoughts of her peers across the country.Interest groups, including the CBI and the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case), were also quick to applaud the announcement.“This is terrific news,” said Sarah Main, Case’s executive director. “Having had a meagre offer for the last seven years, the UK has just returned to an internationally competitive offer for undergraduate and postgraduate students. Some of the UK’s biggest companies talk of the ‘war for talent’ in areas such as AI. The UK has just raised its game.”Last year, about 180,000 international students graduated from British universities with about 6,000 moving on to skilled work visas.Paul Blomfield, the Labour MP who co-chairs the all-party parliamentary group for international students, also said he was delighted by the change, for which his group has repeatedly called since 2012.“The next step would be to remove barriers in visa application processes and in particular to review the credibility interviews which allow Home Office staff to block applications on the basis of questions which no UK student could be expected to answer,” said Blomfield.But Blomfield, Main and others called for more detail about how the new regime would operate. Rather than allowing graduates to stay as of right, as Canada does, the new “immigration route” would require graduates to apply again for the extra two years. If they did find permanent work in that time they would need to apply for a further visa to stay.The announcement was reported widely in India, where there has been a steep fall in the number of international students coming to the UK since the two-year post-study allowance was ended.In 2010-11, when May described the two-year period as “too generous”, there were more than 50,000 Indian international students in he UK. But applications slumped after the new rule and other changes were brought in. Last year, there were just 22,000 students from India after strenuous efforts by the UK government and universities to increase recruitment.Sir Dominic Asquith, the British high commissioner to India, said: “This exciting announcement will help ensure that the UK remains one of the best destinations for students across the world.”The government said it planned to introduce the change for students starting on courses from the 2020-21 academic year, giving universities time to crank up their marketing campaigns.But current students say that it is unfair that they should have to miss out. Matt Mottaghian, an international student completing a masters degree at the University of Lancaster, said he had to go to great lengths to apply for an entrepreneurship visa in order to stay in the UK.“Offering this only to students from next year makes current students in the country feel even more abandoned,” Mottaghian said. “I truly believe that fairness tells us that such law should apply to all current students too, which will then make them a huge success for the British economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba6933b5ed0f691dcec530e2af1e9cbe335acd68/0_167_5051_3030/master/5051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4d6032406648abb67f4094cb28bde59","title":"europes marine sanctuaries are paper parks","story":"WWF conservationists say marine wildlife sanctuaries are failing to protect the seasEurope’s marine wildlife sanctuaries are no more than “paper parks” that are failing to protect the seas, a report from conservationists has said.European seas, from the North East Atlantic ocean to the Adriatic, are in a “poor condition”, with coastal states failing to meet targets to protect marine wildlife, a report by WWF has concluded.Janica Borg, lead author of the study, said it was impossible for Europe to meet the 2020 target. “Without urgent action to implement effective plans for nature conservation or restoration, with proper restrictions against extractive activities, nearly all EU MPAs will fail to support our ocean’s resilience in the climate emergency” she said.The study found that 19 of 23 member states were falling behind on developing management plans while 11 had not announced any plan at all.The patchy effort means that wildlife in the Baltic, North Sea and Mediterranean remains vulnerable to overfishing, bottom trawling, drilling for oil or gas, or noise coming from wind turbines being hammered into the seabed. Scientists revealed last year that destructive fishing is  worse in wildlife zones than outside them.The authors highlighted the problems at Dogger Bank, the large sand bank in the North sea, described as a “cross-border conservation failure” by the UK, Germany and Denmark. Despite a decade of talks on conservation, bottom fishing continues to scar the seabed, while sharks and corals are swept up by industrial trawlers.“There is no one issue to be singled out,” Borg said. “We have really good nature laws … the problem is implementation. Shortcuts are made, derogations are allowed from some of these laws and that means what was intended to be a good way to protect European nature is falling short.”The commission concedes, however, that most marine protected areas are too small, as more than half of the sites are less than 30km squared. It has urged member states to create larger reserves in deeper waters.Marine protected areas restrict economic activities, but also contain smaller marine reserves, where all fishing and energy extraction is banned.WWF argues that short-term economic interests have been prioritised for too long. “Traditionally, marine protection has been seen as a sideline activity,” Borg said. “It is easy at first to put your fisheries in place, to put your shipping in place and only then to start looking at the area we have for conserving nature. But that is actually the wrong way round. Marine protection isn’t a hobby … It is something we do because it is absolutely imperative for having any kind of sustainable economy in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1a4d598161e238bb4e2deeab5869406e05c8b28/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44486bd4d775871e570d541fd007a7bc 660w","title":"how to make perfect pan fried pizza felicity cloake recipe","story":"Hardly anyone owns a pizza oven, or even an oven hot enough to cook pizza in, so what a joy it is that you can make a brilliant one in a panThe first time I heard pizza described as a bread, my mind melted like mozzarella in a wood-fired oven – yet underneath the toppings it is, of course, part of the same global family of yeast-raised loaves as naan, pitta, and our own white bloomers. None of these relatives, however, arouse such strong feelings as pizza, something nearer to a religion than a mere bread, with cults devoted to the worship and defence of its various incarnations – woe betide the person who wanders into a temple of the Neapolitan pie and asks for a ham and pineapple, or indeed the fool who demands a thin and crispy base in old-school Chicago.The one thing most fanatics can agree on, however, is that it’s impossible to make a “proper pizza” at home – you can’t get a home oven up to the searing temperatures of a commercial appliance, whether wood-fired or not. Less obsessive disciples can, however, knock-up a pretty decent facsimile, either by heating their oven for hours and faffing around with baking stones, or by sticking a frying pan on the hob. The choice is yours.The fact that this is a bread should give you a clue as to the best type of flour to use. You can make pizza with plain flour, as J Kenji López-Alt’s recipe on the Serious Eats website recommends. (Though he himself prefers “fancy” Italian flour, he says the differences are marginal enough for it not to be a necessity.) But, because a good base is chewy and bubbly, rather than flat and crunchy, a higher protein flour is a better bet. This is because the higher the protein content, the more gluten will develop in the dough. This much-maligned matrix is the thing that gives dough its elasticity, allowing it to stretch into beautiful big, blistered bubbles in the oven, rather than staying resolutely solid, like one of those boxed supermarket pizza bases that passed for authentic in the 1980s, but now resemble nothing more than a Bath Oliver biscuit.Which is all to say that higher protein flours, like the strong bread flour used by Olivia Potts in her book A Half-Baked Idea, or the 00 flour often sold as pasta flour in British supermarkets are a better choice. The latter is particularly good because it’s so finely milled (00 refers to the grade), which makes for a particularly delicate, crisp crust.Let’s be honest: we all dream of homemade pizza that’s quicker than a takeaway, so I decide to try a recipe from Sainsbury’s magazine using baking powder, rather than the traditional yeast, leaving it to rest for a mere 30 minutes before baking. The results, though not unpleasant, are more like a pitta than a pizza – great if you have a lot of hungry and fairly indiscriminate mouths to feed in a hurry, but not one for the pizza aficionado.Leaving aside sourdough pizzas, which are a whole different kettle of anchovies, there’s no substitute for yeast, and yeast takes time to work its magic how much is an interesting matter. The recipes I try range from a 10-hour rise and proof as the minimum for López-Alt’s recipe, to a five-day rise for Potts’ pizza, with the Pizza Pilgrims describing 24 hours as “optimal”. The difference is largely due to the fact that Potts’ and Mascoli’s doughs both rise in the fridge, in a process known as cold fermentation. This slows the action of the yeast, but gives the finished product a better flavour and texture (apparently cold fermentation results in stronger gluten networks). You’ll need to bring it back to room temperature before shaping and cooking, but in this instance, patience is very much a virtue: if you want a truly complex flavour, you need to plan ahead.Not too far ahead though López-Alt has done some interesting research on this very subject, and concludes that a rise time of between three and five days is optimal: “Eventually, even at cold temperatures, the yeast will start to produce a large amount of those sour milk aromas, throwing off the flavour of your bread. And there’s an even bigger problem: as the alcohol content and acidity of the dough rises, eventually it gets so high that the yeast simply ceases to operate.”I reckon three days is plenty, but that may be because I find it very hard to wait any longer for my pizza.Salt is a must in pizza dough and, though it’s frowned upon by purists, I’m not too snooty to add a little sugar to help the yeast along and give a more complex flavour, though you can leave it out if you prefer. While olive oil gives a pleasing flavour, it also softens the texture, so I’m not going to use it – and I’d prefer to save herbs for the top, rather than adding them to the dough, as Sainsbury’s suggest.The most important thing I learn, very belatedly, is that a cast-iron pan is the best tool for cooking pizza on the hob: nonstick pans are out for safety reasons, and my stainless -steel pan turned out some great pizza, but at the expense of its shiny silver base. The cast-iron skillet recommended by Potts, however, produces perfect results: if you have one, use it.You don’t need to grease it, unless you’re actually deep-frying the pizzas, as in Mascoli’s recipe – and I’m sorry to report these are excessively good). Just get it good and hot, though not so hot it burns the base before it cooks through – you might need to experiment a bit with the first batch to find out what works for your pan.López-Alt, in a quest to eliminate the need for an oven entirely, recommends cooking the dough on both sides with a lid on, and then browning the crust by turning it in a gas flame, or with a blowtorch. This works well if you don’t happen to have a grill, but it’s much easier, and I think better texture-wise, to char the bottom on the hob and then transfer it to a hot grill to brown the top, and to melt any cheese. (Make sure your toppings are at room temperature as Lopez-Alt cautions, or they will take too long to warm up).On which point, I’m happy for you to top your pizza with whatever you like, even chicken (the horror), but all the recipes I try call for a classic mozzarella and tomato combo, often with a few leaves of basil, or “if you’re feeling truly nostalgic”, as Potts puts it, a sprinkling of dried oregano. She also makes a buttery, garlicky, oniony sauce, a “bastardisation” of a Marcella Hazan recipe so delicious, I eat it with a spoon, but it feels like gilding the lily here: Mascoli’s simple simmered tomatoes, with a pinch of salt and sugar, give a purer tomato hit. He explains his topping is oil-free because the pizzette will be deep-fried, but in fact I prefer it even for dry-fried pizzas you can always drizzle some oil on top before serving.Cheese-wise, you can’t beat buffalo mozzarella (note: if you want to use firmer pizza mozzarella, you may need to deploy a blowtorch to help it melt, because it will take longer than the wetter stuff). Sainsbury’s also add parmesan, roasted peppers and cherry tomatoes, but, a few herbs aside, I don’t think it needs anything else for perfection. Eat immediately, and certainly fast enough to burn your tongue: it’s worth it.500g Italian 00 flour, plus extra to dust1½ tsp dried active yeast1 tsp fine salt1 tsp sugar (optional)To top 1 400g tin chopped plum tomatoes1 ball buffalo mozzarella1 bunch basil, or a sprinkle of dried oreganoExtra-virgin olive oil, to drizzleMix the flour, yeast, salt and sugar then stir in 325ml water to a smooth dough.

Here’s a simple guideWine is such a simple a pleasure: the fragrance, the flavour, the mellow enjoyment of a glass over a good meal with friends. OK, some of that mellowness is chemically induced, but alcohol too is simple, as long as it’s taken in moderation.So, if drinking wine is straightforward, why must choosing it be quite so complicated? There are countries and regions and quality levels and grapes. Wine labels vary wildly: an Australian chardonnay will have the country and the grape somewhere on the label, but nothing on a typical chablis will tell you it is also made with chardonnay grapes.There are two ways to look at this. The first is that learning is half the fun. Just as most of us wouldn’t get the cultural references threaded through our language unless they were pointed out to us, so wine is a cultural artefact with a whole set of references attached. You don’t need to know them, but to know them is to be part of a conversation – just as people who get Shakespeare references are participating in a 400-year discussion on the nature of Englishness.Second, if I am going to put something in my body, and serve it to my guests, I would quite like to know what it is.That brings us to the latest development designed to muddle the heads of the thirsty. Natural wine is all the rage: some bars are dedicated to it, while others focus on artisanal wines of all kinds, including organic or biodynamic. Which is marvellous, except that the differences between these designations are not immediately clear. If a wine is labelled biodynamic, what does that mean? And if it isn’t so labelled, is it definitely not biodynamic? So here, for the terminally puzzled, is a quick guide to the new terminology.This is the simplest of the new categories. Organic wine, like organic food, is made without the use of artificial pesticides, fungicides, herbicides etc, according to rules laid down by bodies such as the Soil Association. Vine-growers can promote growth and fight disease using naturally occurring products, such as sulphur dioxide, or they can introduce predators or induce sexual confusion, using pheromones to prevent moths mating and producing vine-destroying caterpillars. In the winery, they must also avoid prohibited additives.Organic wine is relatively uncontroversial, since most winemakers and wine-drinkers who are interested in quality and sustainability agree that avoiding substances that might affect human or environmental health is a good idea. Terrible weather conditions – the droughts, frost, hail and downpours that are becoming more frequent and severe with the climate crisis – can ruin crops, tempting smaller winemakers to break the rules. Still, the thinking goes, many of the non-organic fixes will ultimately destroy the soil and the vineyard, not to mention affect the taste of the wine.Tempted? Try Château Musar (Lebanon) or Domaine de la Mordorée (France). Biodynamic winemaking follows the principles of the philosopher Rudolf Steiner and is based on the idea that, in order for it to reach its full potential, a vineyard needs to be well-balanced and harmonious. Organic is good, runs this thinking, but doesn’t go nearly far enough. Some parts of the methodology are obvious others are weird. So, crop rotation and the promotion of bioersity make perfect sense this is how peasants did things in feudal times, using rest and alternative crops to return nutrients to depleted soils. The spraying of infusions of natural substances including nettles, blossoms, minerals and manure on the vineyard also has an obvious logic to it: healthy soil will produce healthy grapes. However, burying cow horns packed with fermented dung in the vineyard tends to cause sniggers, as does pruning and harvesting in accordance with the phases of the moon. (Some winemakers play music to their vines at sunrise or sunset, which may or may not help the vines, but is certainly soothing for visitors.)Do biodynamics work? Many of these wines are beautiful, so their creators are clearly doing something right. If we accept that the tides are dictated by the moon’s waxing and waning, why not the ripeness of grapes? The ancient Greeks and Romans harvested this way, and this wouldn’t be the only example of practices discredited by contemptuous moderns who are then forced to eat, or rather drink, their words.This is by far the most debated category, probably because, unlike with organic or biodynamic viticulture, there is no overseeing body that assigns certification to winemakers, and therefore very few generally accepted rules. The idea, however, is to intervene with the grape’s own process as little as possible. So, in addition to avoiding synthetic chemical products, filtration (which removes particles that cloud the wine) is banned, as is the addition of industrial yeasts only naturally occurring yeasts are permissible. Very little sulphur is added and most of the accepted tweaks are avoided. So, no sugar or enzymes are added some wineries even refuse to regulate temperature.Whether you see this as the equivalent of athletes avoiding steroids or a senseless refusal of modern advances in winemaking is up to you: there are arguments on both sides. Sulphur dioxide, for example, is used to stabilise wines and keep them fresh, which is vital if they are travelling internationally. These days, the amount of sulphur is carefully regulated (dried fruit contains more of it than most wines, as does fruit squash).Some also struggle with the notion of no-intervention wine. Not messing around too much with a natural product is one thing, but wine is not naturally occurring – avoid intervention altogether and you get vinegar.The result is that some natural wines are delightful, others far less so, and here you must trust your tastebuds. If some natural-wine evangelist informs you that all other wines are not just unnatural but “dead”, my advice is to run away.Bear in mind that not all winemakers who adopt these practices choose to get certification, which is expensive and time-consuming to acquire and easy to forfeit (one spray, in a difficult season, and all the hard work and financial outlay is for nothing). If in doubt, ask. Nobody is using, or not using, these definitions with the aim of confusing consumers. On the contrary, winemakers and wine-sellers are proud to be offering the best wines they can, and they want you to know what they are doing. They just don’t always find the clearest ways to tell you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d62315905a64597682926b930bb9418ff08319/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c38237c3898aa7c2c0c110f3e5033e8f","title":"international football 10 talking points from the latest round of games","story":"Kosovo showed why people have been showering praise on them while Mick McCarthy has plenty to think aboutKosovo came into their match against England second in Group A and being talked up by everyone, Gareth Southgate included, as dangerous opponents.

His switch to 4-4-2 put England’s creaky centre-backs under more pressure than they had endured in the opening period, and it made the difference to a second half in which Kosovo lived up to their billing. Paul MacInnesThere is no such thing as a friendly between Argentina and Chile. The two teams have developed a frenetic rivalry in recent years, sharing four red cards in the previous four meetings. Lionel Messi’s red card against Chile in July’s Copa América third-place play-off spared him from Friday’s encounter, where the reckless and dangerous challenges resumed from both sides. Argentina were particularly on the receiving end, with Juventus’s Paolo Dybala, Inter’s Lautaro Martínez and Tottenham’s Giovani Lo Celso all caught above the ankle with studs – the latter also sustaining a hip injury that will keep him sidelined for the next six weeks. For Spurs and other clubs, this fixture – played in front of a sparse crowd in Los Angeles – must have seemed wholly unnecessary and ill-thought out, with perhaps Alexis Sánchez completing 90 minutes the only positive. Michael Butler• The Recap: sign up for the best of our sport coverageGermany emerged from Belfast after their mini crisis, having lost at home to the Netherlands. Michael O’Neill and Joachim Löw can take a certain satisfaction, in their own different ways. Northern Ireland have long been noted as being a primarily physical threat, especially at home. However, as O’Neill stresses, they now have an extra dimension, in terms of athleticism and confidence on the ball, as illustrated by George Saville and Jamal Lewis. In goal too, Bailey Peacock Farrell looked impressive, as Germany fashioned chances as well as goals from Marcel Halstenberg and Serge Gnabry. Löw was pleased with the result if not altogether the performance. His instincts to stick with new players, such as Halstenberg, was vindicated. Julian TaylorIf you are Italian, Group J makes for pretty reading. Six wins out of six, and six points clear at the top, meaning they are potentially only one more win away from qualification for Euro 2020. While progress is being made, this week’s narrow away wins only came after two shocking refereeing decisions. With the score at 1-1, Armenia’s Aleksandr Karapetyan was sent off for an elbow that never was, while Finland – also drawing 1-1 with 10 minutes left – were extremely unlucky to be penalised by the Scottish referee Bobby Madden for a handball inside the box. Roberto Mancini deserves some praise, but optimism must be tempered: only Bosnia and Herzegovina from Group J are ranked inside Fifa’s top 50. Italy are still a long way off being considered anything other than dark horses for next year’s tournament. MB• Euro 2020 roundup: Italy beat Finland while Norway draw in SwedenOne of the criticisms levelled at Ryan Giggs is that he still does not know his best starting XI. Giggs was appointed Wales manager in January last year and has used 43 players across 15 matches. His argument would be that injuries and a lack of match fitness have contributed heavily. Whether he has a case or not, with two critical qualifiers coming up, Giggs badly needs to get his team selection and formation right. Friday’s unconvincing 2-1 win over Azerbaijan strengthened the calls for another midfielder to be included at the expense of a makeshift strikerfalse nine. Aaron Ramsey’s possible return from injury could solve that problem. A 4-3-3 formation featuring Gareth Bale through the middle, with Dan James and Harry Wilson either side, would give Wales a threat on the counterattack and more control in the centre of the pitch. Stuart JamesThe fallout from Umaru Bangura’s missed penalty in injury-time of Sierra Leone’s World Cup qualifying defeat to Liberia spilled over into violence after the FC Zurich midfielder’s home was pelted with stones by angry fans. “It was one of the worst days of my life,” Bangura told the BBC while holed up in his bedroom. “I can’t even go outside because I didn’t expect this kind of hostility towards me.” There were also reports that four Red Cross staff were injured after coming under attack following the final whistle in Freetown as they attempted to protect Bangura after his penalty was saved by the 18-year-old Liberian goalkeeper Ashley Williams. “Hooliganism is becoming unprecedented,” said the sports minister, Ibrahim Nyelenkeh. “I think measures should be put in place to combat it.” Ed AaronsIt felt impossible not to spurt with laughter as Hampden Park’s Tannoy announcer used full-time of the mauling by Belgium to urge supporters to buy tickets for the visit of San Marino. On a Sunday evening in October, just days after facing Russia in Moscow, the team ranked 211th and bottom of the Fifa rankings come to town. As things stand, only San Marino keep Scotland from the foot of Group I. The Scottish FA’s desire to buy Hampden from Queen’s Park always looked questionable. When far from full, the stadium lacks any form of atmosphere. Scotland has alternative grounds to fit the requirements of the national side and showpiece domestic matches. When asked how Hampden could be transformed into an imposing venue the Scottish FA’s chief executive offered the hopeful solution of winning matches. With the opposite scenario continuing to play out, a soulless, sparse backdrop to San Marino’s visit will do nobody any favours. Ewan MurraySaido Berahino has made a decent start to life in Belgium having found the net three times in his first four appearances for Zulte Waregem but his struggles for Burundi continued this week after an indifferent Africa Cup of Nations campaign. Having been eliminated in the group stages without scoring a goal, the Swallows were dumped out of World Cup qualifying by neighbours Tanzania after failing to convert a single penalty in the shootout after two 1-1 draws. Berahino was one of the culprits, meaning he has not scored a penalty in his last five attempts – a run that stretches back to May 2015 against Chelsea for West Brom. EA• The Fiver: sign up for our daily football emailGeorgia did the Republic of Ireland a favour in the Euro 2016 qualifiers by beating Scotland they helped the Irish again by holding Denmark to a draw. To take advantage of that unexpected boon, Mick McCarthy’s men need to win in Tbilisi next month. Conor Hourihane scored the winner when the sides met in Dublin earlier in the campaign but this time the Aston Villa midfielder may be asked to play at left-back owing to Enda Stevens’s suspension and fitness doubts over Matt Doherty. Hourihane did a reasonable job in that unfamiliar role in Tuesday’s win over Bulgaria, while Josh Cullen or Jack Bryne both made good cases for replacing him (andor Glenn Whelan) in midfield, depending on how bold McCarthy wants to be. Paul Doyle• Match report: Republic of Ireland 3-1 BulgariaIt seems ridiculous that after scoring four goals for Portugal against Lithuania, this talking point would be about anything other than Cristiano Ronaldo. But while Ronaldo finishes the moves, it is Bernardo Silva who continues to be the beating heart of this team, instrumental in Portugal’s impressive 4-2 win over Serbia on Saturday with a goal and an assist, while laying on two more goals for Ronaldo in the 5-1 win in Vilnius. Silva has had a remarkable year, winning the player of the tournament award in a victorious Nations League campaign, as well as a domestic treble with Manchester City, and there was bemusement when he wasn’t nominated as one of 10 players for Fifa’s The Best award. The 26-year-old has long lost his “under-rated” tag, but still doesn’t seem to be widely regarded for what he is: one of the best players in the world.

The signature Barkley burst certainly looks good when it starts. It certainly feels exciting. It definitely feels as if something important is going to happen when he picks up the ball in his own half and sets off on a charge into opposition territory.Then the wait begins. The momentum stalls. The deeper Barkley goes, the less threatening he looks. You find yourself willing him on, urging him to pick the right pass, but the moment slips away and by the end nobody is quite sure what that was all about. There was something there, a teasing glimpse of something special, but all that raw talent still feels too vague to make a meaningful impact when it matters.Barkley was a disappointment during England’s eccentric 5-3 victory against Kosovo on Tuesday. The Chelsea midfielder was heckled by the St Mary’s crowd after selfishly ruining a four-on-three counterattack deep into the second half and the impression was of a player forcing the issue when calm was required, resulting in an uneven performance that raises concerns over his place in Gareth Southgate’s side.The international break has not gone well for the 25-year-old. Having struggled to pick the lock against a deep Bulgaria defence on Saturday, opponents as open as Kosovo ought to have played into his hands. Barkley was the highest player in England’s midfield three, with Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice mopping up behind him, and he had space all night. The only question was whether he could use it.The answer will come as no surprise to anyone who has watched Barkley struggle to take games by the scruff of the neck for Chelsea. The contest passed him by for long spells, which had the unfortunate effect of making him try ever more extravagant moves in an attempt to impress Gareth Southgate, and even the penalty he won for Harry Kane came after he had drained the life from an attack by hanging on to the ball for too long.It gives Southgate a problem. Even if it is possible to see why the manager is a fan of Barkley, it is questionable whether his main assets – the powerful runs, the occasional incision, the ability to shoot from long range – translate well at international level. It is debatable whether that is the way to bring the best out of England’s scintillating attack.Do they need a midfielder who needlessly wastes possession and dips in and out of games? We all know what happens when England lose the midfield battle in big games. They were punished by Croatia’s Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic in their World Cup semi-final last year and it was a similar story when Frenkie de Jong ran rings around them in their Nations League semi-final defeat by the Netherlands in June. For all that Southgate is trying to develop a more refined style, inefficiency in possession remains a weakness that could undermine England at Euro 2020.That nagging concern makes it all the more frustrating that Southgate currently favours a safety-first midfield trio of Barkley, Henderson and Rice, especially when he has players in reserve who could give England more control. Players such as Harry Winks, a clever deep-lying orchestrator who was impressive in Tottenham’s run to the Champions League final last season, or James Maddison, who is in fine creative form at Leicester. Phil Foden, who scored twice for the under-21s on Monday, may also push for inclusion if he features more for Manchester City.Yet it was telling that Southgate did not call upon Maddison’s ingenuity against Kosovo. It is an old English failing to regard creators as dispensable luxuries and the suspicion is the formation will need to be tweaked from 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1 to work the 22-year-old into the side.In Southgate’s defence, he can point to a back-line that flirted with disaster against Kosovo. Electing not to give a leaky back four an extra layer of protection would be a risk. Henderson’s energy and leadership have made him an important player for Liverpool and, while Rice was at fault for Kosovo’s second goal, the 20-year-old’s performances for West Ham have been excellent and he is a also a snappy, perceptive passer.Barkley is the most vulnerable of the three. Chelsea’s Mason Mount, whose brief cameo against Kosovo suggests Southgate regards him as an easier fit than Maddison, is breathing down his neck and Liverpool’s Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain is another boasting speed and athleticism.This is the challenge for Southgate: even if he is not minded to make any drastic gambles, there are ways for him to ensure the best attack England have had in years does not go to waste next summer. A manager who has established world-class forwards such as Kane and Raheem Sterling does not have to wait for Barkley to realise his potential."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1776c95aaa697176e445e162031e037acdf9cfe/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06e6afb03ba8cbe820ae4f2b28f79a0a","title":"what does living fully mean welcome to the age of pseudo profound nonsense","story":"Inspirational quotes of dubious provenance are just one of the ways in which social media sells a warped vision of ‘living fully’You’ve seen them before, because they are all over Instagram: the captions urging you to embrace your expansion, whatever that means, slow down to savor the moment, and hustle like you’re Beyoncé – all at once.“Start visualizing what you want, then say no to anything that isn’t it,” reads one. Another: “Buy the plane ticket, quit the job, plan the trip, wander into the unknown, open your heart, take the leap.”These reminders to “live fully” are omnipresent on social media platforms. We are constantly told how to live well, happily, adventurously or spontaneously. An army of experts are instructing us to wash our faces, to be a badass, and to say yes.This #inspiration strategy works because humans are wired to want significance and meaning. But what does “living fully” really mean in the age of Instagram, when anyone can wear matching yoga pants as they stand, arms outstretched and back to the camera, soaking in whatever scenic background they’ve found that day?Madi Richardson, 23, explains that if she’d been asked what “living fully” meant a few years ago, she would have said traveling. Right after high school, Richardson was following a plethora of people her age on Instagram, including some with significant followings. “The photos I saw of them were on vacations,” she explains. “Living, I guess, what seemed like everything but worry or negative emotions.” With every scroll, Richardson saw glorious summers packed full with local music festivals and scenic hikes, usually with inspirational quotes peppered in between.Soon, doubt started to creep in. Were her peers living a better, more exciting life than she was? Although she didn’t post those kinds of photos herself, she says: “There was jealousy and feelings of guilt because I didn’t go on a vacation every other weekend, or go scuba ing, jump out of a plane, or camp in the wilderness all summer.”As a photographer herself, she also had to contend with professional pressure, wondering if the better cameras or bigger cities others showcased were missing pieces to even more success.Richardson describes such curated lives as a “pecking order of excitement”, explaining that she had other responsibilities, including her own bills and pressure to attend college, that didn’t align with this narrow definition of living fully. “It took me a while to become at peace with who I am,” she says. “It wasn’t until I tried to mimic the trends that I realized: this isn’t who I am.”Dr Erin Vogel, a social psychologist who explores the influence technology has on our lives and wellbeing, says: “Social media seems to define ‘living fully’ as being adventurous, spontaneous and extroverted. For people who are fulfilled by a quieter life, social media seems to tell them that they’re living life the wrong way.”She explains what most social media users know to be true: when using social media, users often compare their lives with others’. In reality, even your most adventurous friend probably has some lackluster experiences or boring evenings spent watching Netflix.Vogel points to the unfortunate trend of people taking selfies with wild animals and getting injured as an example of how “doing it for the ’gram” can backfire. It can be a positive, she says, if it leads you to push yourself and try new things. Often, it takes you away from the present moment instead. “You may book an excursion for your next trip thinking ‘this will be fun’,” Vogel says. “But in the back of your mind, you might also be thinking about how great the pictures will be.”The same goes for quote photos, which are another element of the “highlight reel” Instagram has come to be regarded as.Gordon Pennycook, an assistant professor of behavioural science at the University of Regina, has published research on “pseudo-profound bullshit”, which he defines as things constructed without regard for the truth. He notes that it is “quite possible that ostensibly inspirational quotes could fit into the broader category”. Pennycook says this type of content spreads online because we don’t spend a lot of time thinking about it. “This is why inspirational quotes often don’t make any sense,” he explains. “Typically, it gets spread because it has some sort of intuitive or emotional appeal.”He points out that the most significant difference between the spread of inspirational quotes and the spread of fake news is that quotes generally make users feel good, while fake news provokes anger or fear. “In either case, emotionality overrides rationality,” he says.But what happens when an inidual does live fully and authentically, and is met with skepticism?When Nicole Roberts, 31, came out the other side of a bad relationship, she opted to move from San Diego to Austin for a promotion without knowing anyone there. “I had many people respond one of two ways,” Roberts says. The first was “are you crazy? You don’t know anyone there!” and the second was “Yolo! Live your life!”It bothered her, she says, to hear so many assume she had not thoroughly considered her new move. All she wanted was a change of scenery and the opportunity to grow after a stifling personal situation.That nuance – that living fully can be quiet that what looks like a grand adventure could really be a complicated personal reset that even our most inspired choices may be steeped in anxiety – goes missing when all we have are visual examples.Behind the projection of freedom, real life isn’t as neat when you’re actually living fully. It’s often messy or complicated and demands we ask ourselves questions that run deeper than advice to “create a life you don’t need a vacation from”.What makes us happy, at its core, is an existential question, according to Sara Kuburic, a psychotherapist and counselor who works with millennials. She believes inspirational tropes are popular because they offer the promise of immediate fulfillment. “I find that people increasingly conceptualize living fully as seizing opportunities, taking risks and exploring the unknown,” she says. “Living fully, in the Instagram age, is often then reduced to doing things that would be worth documenting.”But, Kuburic argues, a full life – which she defines as one full of meaning, freedom, responsibility, and grounded in an authentic relationship with yourself – is the same as it was pre-Instagram.“We are eager to live our lives fully,” she says. “Yet the pressure to prove this to our ‘friends’ is a major reason why we are not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b133e16d39b789cdb353e60df283b26eb78e05/136_0_4028_2418/master/4028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9b1e32e888905b016547ff25349e20f","title":"marriage women earnings income feminism","story":"Rush Limbaugh is wrong to blame feminists for the lack of ‘high-earning husbands’, but some women do have odd ideas about wedlockHang on, I thought marriage was about love, not combined incomes? Sure, says Daniel Lichter, a Cornell professor and the study’s lead author, “but it also is fundamentally an economic transaction”. And, Lichter says, “Many young men today have little to bring to the marriage bargain, especially as young women’s educational levels …now exceed their male suitors.”Why do so many men have such poor prospects? There are various theories including, Lichter notes, the “gig economy of unstable, low-paying service jobs”. But you know what’s easier than blaming the economy? Blaming women! The fact women are struggling to find suitable husbands has caused glee in conservative circles. US shock-jock Rush Limbaugh says this story shows feminism has come back to bite women “in the butt”. “They’re earning money, but they still have the same attitude about marriage,” he crowed.I hate to say this, but Limbaugh does have a very tiny point. I’m struck by how many empowered women regress to the 1950s when it comes to marriage. They fight for equality at work, but still have traditional expectations when it comes to men proposing with expensive diamond rings. And the idea that marrying a rich dude is something one should aspire to is still very much entrenched in society.

But even many of the better practitioners – Jóhann Jóhannsson or Clint Mansell, for example – write music that often betrays their background in the digital world. You can almost hear the vestiges of music-making software in their arrangements, as if they have been plotted on graph paper.This is never the case with Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, whose orchestral film scores have an intense rigour and musicianship that are certainly on display tonight. We hear extracts from his 2012 suite Water, for instance, which was composed entirely in the octatonic scale popular with Rimsky-Korsakov and Messiaen – but here Greenwood gives the melody the intensity of an Indian raga by playing an accompanying drone on a tambura. His devilishly complex piece for solo piano, 88, is brilliantly executed by pianist Katherine Tinker, who sounds as though she’s playing a transcription of a Thelonious Monk solo at double-speed.Greenwood has had music performed at the Proms before but this is the first he has curated, and he uses it to showcase his favourite composers. There is a strident movement from the first Sinfonietta by his hero and friend Penderecki, and a violin solo by Biber that gives violinist Daniel Pioro the chance to show off his double-stopping skills, while Greenwood also provides the suitably throbbing, muted bass guitar on Steve Reich’s Pulse. The centrepiece, however, is the premier of Greenwood’s Horror Vacui. At first it’s hard to work out what is happening: Pioro is playing at the front of the stage, surrounded by 68 strings players who have been placed, almost confrontationally, on raised platforms, and it sounds as though Pioro’s woozy, angular violin solo is being treated electronically. Eventually you realise that the echoes and digital delays are all being reproduced by the string section in real time.Greenwood trained as a violinist and is clearly fascinated by the glitches and irregularities of stringed instruments, and here the players appear to be using plectrums or the backs of their bows to recreate ghostly electronic effects. It’s a startling, terrifying and challenging way to end a compelling Prom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bc4a75642ff282746f2f7ddf0b499aefe805d2a/0_372_5580_3348/master/5580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16eb2a3762c4897031e92916d1311abe","title":"the slp review serge pizzorno earth london","story":"EartH, LondonBy channelling the charisma of hip-hop, house and rock opera, Serge Pizzorno earns the solo spotlightSome men, as middle age heaves into view, buy motorcycles and zip around the countryside pretending to be Peter Fonda. Others allow greetings at the school-gate to turn into a furtive affair. For Serge Pizzorno of Kasabian, the looming 40s have brought the desire to shed the skin of the rock guitarist and become a hip-hop star. The rapping part isn’t as important, though, as being able to swagger across the stage in a white vest and thick chains, knees bent, arms straight, and Pizzorno does a lot of that.He also puts on a suit and appears behind a presidential-style podium for Meanwhile … at the Welcome Break, suggesting that the part of him that doesn’t want to be Tupac quite fancies being Pete Townshend and knocking out the odd rock opera. It’s tremendous fun in a faintly ridiculous way, not least because, whether or not he’s having a midlife crisis, he knows how to knock out a tune, and also because the presentation – at one point Stephen Graham appears on a screen fronting a faux shopping channel video – is more ambitious than one normally gets in midsize venues.Most of what Pizzorno offers on his first solo album as the SLP isn’t a million miles away from his main band – it’s a bit heavier on the borrowings from R\u0026ampB, house and, yes, hip-hop, but then Kasabian have always had a bit more imagination than most of their ladrock brethren. Here though, it’s all about bringing the focus to him alone. For almost the entire evening, the band are hidden behind screens, while Pizzorno repeatedly clambers into the crowd and chivvies them in to cheering for him. It speaks of someone needy for love and attention, and it is offered to him. “Go on, Serge!” is shouted, repeatedly, as if he’s a football player.The album is played in its entirety and then Pizzorno is gone. It’s just the right length – an hour or so – to marvel at how rock music can still throw up genuine eccentrics willing to throw all their ideas at the wall in the hope that some of them will stick.

You know, it wasn’t that long ago that the United Kingdom and other nations called out China for some of its cyber-activity publicly.“If we are going to allow countries access to our market, I think we should all expect a code of behaviour that is fair play – we are British, we believe in fair play. So I think that will also be reflected in those discussions.”The UK has been grappling with whether to allow Huawei to supply 5G network technology for months, a decision that led to the sacking of Gavin Williamson as defence secretary by then prime minister, Theresa May, for leaking what was intended to be the final decision.The decision held that Huawei, the market leader in 5G technology, would be allowed to supply “non-core” parts of the network. But after May’s replacement by Boris Johnson, this has come under review, with the US demanding Huawei not be used.Washington repeatedly said it would have to review its intelligence sharing with the UK if Huawei were adopted in British phone networks, because it fears the Chinese company’s technology could be compromised in the future.China, however, has warned not using Huawei as a supplier would delay the rollout of 5G in the UK. Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to the UK, said Britain would “lag a year-and-a-half behind”, according to some forecasts, and dropping Huawei would “send a bad message to Chinese business”.Wallace conceded the Brexit crisis had delayed the timing of any announcement. The minister said he could not provide an exact timetable because “obviously there’s been some chop in the government, up and down”.The defence secretary was speaking at DSEI, Europe’s biggest arms fair, which is attended by an estimated 35,000 delegates. More than 100 people have been arrested for trying to disrupt preparations for the controversial event.Wallace also said he wanted to beef up drone security at airports, two days before a planned climate protest at Heathrow aimed at disrupting flights in and out of the country’s busiest airport.Flights were also disrupted last December for several days at Gatwick, amid confused reports of drone sightings that presented a risk to civil aviation.Wallace said that the RAF would start working on a three-year programme with Italian defence company Leonardo that would be “looking at how to detect, track, identify and defeat rogue drones”.It is understood Leonardo will also help enhance current anti-drone measures in an attempt to prevent future incidents, although few extra details as to how that would work were available.The defence secretary said that “led to the annual hollowing out of our capability and plans, which ultimately, let down the men and women of our armed forces”. By 2021, the defence budget will reach £41bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dc5001b5933d03bfc994a078b9b510b864f463d/87_0_1375_825/master/1375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e17a44518bb1d53dd4c9413e54e27881","title":"brexit latest news public would not benefit from hearing official worst case no deal assumptions says leadsom live news","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenQ: Doctors and schools need more funding.

Every school will get the same amount of funding. That can be done without breaching fiscal discipline. And that can happen within a dynamic market economy that can pay for fantastic services. I will post a verdict and summary shortly.Q: Are you planning to leave without a deal?Johnson says staying in the EU would cost £250m a week. That’s £1bn a month. Think how you could spent the money. Let’s get our priorities right, and get this thing done.Q: Why can’t we leave the EU?That’s because parliament voted, he says. He says there is meant to be a vote on a deal. But if we don’t get one, we will leave on 31 October.Q: What will happen to jobs if we leave with no deal?Johnson says he wants a deal. But the UK can manage if we leave without one. He wants a high wage, low tax economy.Q: Can you confirm we will leave the EU on 31 October?Johnson says he has probably said that five times already, but he is delighted to confirm that. We must get this done, he says.Q: How will you restore faith in politics?By doing what we promise, says Johnson. He says he wants fantastic public services, funded by a dynamic market economy.Q: “I despair of what is happening. I have lost all hope of democracy.”Johnson says he is on the questioner’s side. He is trying to work this out. He says he has talked to Leo Varadkar and Angela Merkel. The mood is changing, he says. The ice is cracking. He says it is important to get Brexit done.Once that has happened, he can get on with brining the country together.Q: Considering parliament has blocked no deal, what is the status of the backstop?Johnson says the backstop is going to be removed – “I very much hope ... or I insist.”He says there has been “chatter” about this. But he will not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop. That does not work for the UK, he says.Q: Are you anti-democratic? Brexit was supposed to counter authoritarianism. But now you are being authoritarian?Johnson says he disagrees. He says people are fed up because parliament has failed to implement the people’s will.People ask why he is having the Queen’s speech. He wants to push on with his domestic policies.Of course, if opposition MPs disagree, then it is always open to them to take up the offer he made twice to have an election. There is nothing more democratic than an election.For mysterious reasons, the opposition declined, he says.Q: Can you confirm the extra money for the NHS will involve real, extra spending?He says he is asking the NHS to make sure that goes to the front line.There may be a tough winter ahead. But he will make sure the money goes to the front line.Boris Johnson says over 1m people watched the last People’s PMQs.He says he fears people are disconnected from politics. This might be an answer.Q: Will you commit to putting in place a plan to end homelessness, not just rough sleeping?Johnson says he totally agrees.He had a programme as London mayor.But he accepts this is a massive, massive problem.It is important to bring everybody together, he says.Boris Johnson is due to hold his second “People’s PMQs” on Facebook at 5pm.This is from Gina Miller, the campaigner whose legal action led to the government having to pass a bill to trigger article 50, instead of being allowed to start the Brexit process by executive order, and who launched the legal challenge at the English high court against the prorogation decision.Here is more from the Financial Times’ legal commentator David Allen Green on the Scottish court of session’s judgment.Sir Menzies Campbell, the former Lib Dem leader, has told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live that if Boris Johnson loses the prorogation court in the supreme court, he should resign. Campbell said:Buckingham Palace will not be liking this one bit. Because if, as is being contended, there was information which suggested that the true purpose was the frustration of parliament, and that was not revealed to the Queen, then she would have the disadvantage of being given inaccurate or even improper advice. And since she’s obliged to accept advice from the prime minister, then I think it raises into very, very sharp focus precisely the conduct of the prime minister and his very future in that role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae13a0555e54e2e6826eac087cf7988ba96637bc/0_134_3363_2017/master/3363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=205e1827275569e52e4cf34cb0dfe162","title":"fiba world cup france usa basketball","story":"Team USA, the runaway favourites to win the Fiba World Cup for a third time in succession, have been bundled out of the tournament in the quarter-finals by France.Although the US were far from full-strength – with the NBA’s biggest American stars opting out of the tournament – they still fielded a team that included talented players such as Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell and three-time All Star Kemba Walker. The team was also coached by Gregg Popovich, a five-time NBA champion. The result ended a 58-game win for the US at the Olympics and World Cups.“Just got to take it like a man at this point,” Walker said after the game. “We lost. There’s nothing we can do. We competed. We’ve been competing since day one that we got to training camp. But we gave it everything we’ve got. I know we’re Team USA and things of that nature and they’ve been winning for a lot of years, but you know, we didn’t get a chance to pull it off.”France pulled off their 89-79 victory after overhauling a seven-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Their own NBA stars helped fuel the victory: Evan Fournier scored 22 points, while Rudy Gobert added 21 points and 16 rebounds. France had never beaten the US in nine previous meetings in major international competition.There had been signs that the Americans’ reign as champions could end. They scraped past Turkey 93-92 in overtime earlier in the tournament, with the Turks missing four free-throws late in the game.The US now face Serbia in a mini-tournament to decide who will finish in fifth to eighth place. The Americans had been attempting to become the first team to win three consecutive World Cups and three consecutive Olympics.“We came here to win gold,” Gobert said of his team, who now face Argentina in the semi-final. “We knew it wasn’t going to be easy.

Gleneagles, with its rolling Perthshire hills, is about as photogenic a venue as golf can provide.Still, this competition between Europe and the United States requires appropriate context amid evolution – and revolution – in women’s golf. Perhaps it is harsh to criticise giddy advertising claims, but it is tricky not to take exception to one on the Solheim Cup website. This is, we are told, “the pinnacle of women’s golf”.Some bare statistics undermine the point. Eight of the world’s top 10 will not feature in this Solheim Cup. Neither will 14 of the top 20. 22 of the top 30? Nope. Nor 27 of the top 40 and 32 of the top 50. The average world ranking of the US team, odds-on to win the biennial competition for what would be a third time in succession, is 27. Suzann Pettersen’s position at 635 – the Norwegian has barely played for two years after taking a break to start a family – skews the European equivalent but a figure of 105 still paints a picture of implied standards.South Korea dominate the summit of women’s golf, with notable mentions due to Thailand, China and Japan. Excitement at this year’s Women’s British Open at Woburn as Charley Hull headed home and Georgia Hall launched a title defence was undone as Hinako Shibuno, who had not played outside Japan before, triumphed.Perhaps sport does not need best versus best to be engaging. Match play tends to be gripping no matter the level. Maybe time-honoured needle between Europe and the US - see Annika Sorenstam’s chip as ordered by the Americans to be re-taken in 2000, or the almighty rumpus involving Pettersen four years ago – means this competition will always be perfectly valid.It would surely benefit from a home success this time around the Solheim Cup had a credibility issue when landing at Killeen Castle in 2011 after the US had won three times on the bounce. Crucially, Europe stopped the rot.Karen Stupples, once a Solheim Cup participant and a former major champion, will take on an analyst role for Golf Channel this week. The Englishwoman played down any notion this joust should be reconfigured.“In my mind, it comes down to the roots of this tournament and the roots of the Ryder Cup,” she explained. “At the very beginning of both, it was very much a classic David and Goliath, and it was that battle of a smaller European Tour versus the giant of the LPGA or the PGA Tour. I think that people warmed to that kind of fight and that battle.“ It’s not something you would see if you had a giant of Korean golf playing against a giant of American golf. You wouldn’t have that same kind of feel to it.”We will know if it is not tried, however. The Ryder Cup’s continual, extraordinary success is intrinsically linked to the level of players within. Koreans and their fellow Asians do have a chance to collectively shine both at the Olympic Games and the International Crown, with the latter due to be held in England next year. Yet while the former is restricted - golf cannot command much attention against track and field – the latter, featuring eight countries, is complicated.With a batch of non-American or European players on the rise, men’s golf introduced the Presidents Cup in the early 1990s. This largely failed: the tournament is ridiculously one-sided while grasping for wider relevance.Yet the women’s game is different. The collective excellence of Koreans in particular will not abate any time soon. If anything, matching them up with Americans would result in embarrassment for the nation which provides such a lucrative living to golfers from the Far East. A bad look, possibly.The phoney war is already under way. Debate as to whether the bookies have it all wrong before a Gleneagles ball is struck involves captains and team members. Watching on from afar are the best female golfers on the planet. This feels a strange, unsatisfactory business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d573e5840066bcdcf32994f9f1a621bbc7089c/84_429_5284_3170/master/5284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=696f3c9d0aee1122bf69a2421490c35e","title":"trevor bayliss england australia ashes oval","story":"The Ashes may be gone but the notion of a dead rubber seldom applies when England meet Australia. A Test match between these two nations has a life of its own. There is now the added incentive of points in the Test Championship (no irony intended here, let’s give it a go) and a drawn series would be a welcome rarity in Ashes cricket.Moreover the supposedly “dead” game can often have lasting significance – there are several precedents for that. In 1987 England arrived in Sydney for the final Test 2-0 up, which was a bit of a surprise even if the team were deemed to have only three weaknesses: their batting, bowling and fielding. A tight contest ensued and was narrowly won by Australia, who were then led by Allan Border, an ego-free man who had no great ambition to be the Test captain.If Australia had lost in Sydney the strong consensus was that Border would have resigned or he would have been sacked. But after that victory it was decided that Border should stay. And so he did until 1994, by which time Australia’s standing in world cricket – and most certainly in Ashes cricket – had soared. Defeat Australia in Sydney back in 1987 and there was every chance that Graeme Wood might have been appointed Test captain.In 1997 England under Mike Atherton arrived at the Oval with the series lost and the mood grim after another Ashes thrashing. Then in the final Test innings of the summer Australia were bowled out by Phil Tufnell and Andy Caddick for 104, 20 runs short of victory. The smiles returned. Atherton had been minded to resign at the end of that series but in the glow of victory and after persuasion from those in charge he agreed to lead the side to the Caribbean that winter, a decision he subsequently regretted (he would resign so swiftly after the Antigua Test that no one could possibly change his mind).So what happens at the Oval is likely to matter, leaving aside the obvious excitement of which side is going to win the game. It will not have a great bearing on the legacy of Trevor Bayliss, who finishes his stint as England coach after the game. He leaves in an unusual manner, without recriminations of any sort. Look back at the line of England coaches and their departures, even those of the obviously successful ones such as Duncan Fletcher and Andy Flower, took place amid considerable angst. Bayliss will be leaving with some scented candles from the press and the almost universal gratitude of his players.The sceptics may pronounce that he did very little for a lot of money, partly because he never bounced up and down on the touchline, jigging like most Premier League football managers – though this may now be beyond Roy Hodgson.Bayliss gave freedom and responsibility to the players he supported them he never slagged them off to protect his own reputation, partly because he did not care too much about his own reputation. The notion that he was a good one-day coach and a bad Test coach has always struck me as an easy yet ridiculous distinction. It would have been better if he had a deeper knowledge of cricketers beyond the England bubble, but in cricket the best coaches do not intervene too much. All in all he leaves having done a fine job.However, he does leave an unsettled Test side, which struggles to score enough runs and has issues to resolve. In another era it would be regarded as astonishing that England should persist with the same batting lineup throughout a Test series when two of their batsmen are averaging less than 20 after four matches: in this case Jason Roy and Jos Buttler.There are three reasons for that: consistency of selection and the emphasis on giving any incumbent a fair go is now deemed to be extremely important. Often this actually proves to be an impediment to the player concerned when he is given such a long spell in the team he inevitably has to do something remarkable to be recalled.There is also the complication that some players– such as Roy, Buttler and Jonny Bairstow – now have the option to forsake Test cricket altogether for some of short‑form leagues if they are not selected.More importantly the selectors are hamstrung when they wish to change and hopefully improve the team because most of the candidates are starved of any red-ball cricket throughout a Test series.This situation will be exacerbated next summer when two short-form formats dominate the cricketing calendar in June, July and August, though this does not seem to worry those in charge from Ashley Giles and Ed Smith downwards. TodayOn Thursday Buttler stays in the team, unlike Roy, who must wait to see whether he is required for the winter Tests.The Oval Test is also a significant one for Joe Root. It is legitimate to debate whether it is best that he should continue to lead the side and whether his drop in form, albeit in a tough summer for batsmen, is a consequence of the captaincy. Unlike Atherton in 1997 he is keen to continue. But that does not necessarily mean that he should. Ben Stokes, Rory Burns and, most obviously, Buttler, if he can score a few runs, are the alternatives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cb0d16b97a487003f177988b6a3950c9a91b5f5/189_239_2827_1697/master/2827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbd215490641406e4e514c9cc368d7be","title":"geoffrey boycott self absorption controversy knighthood cricket","story":"It has taken 40 years – longer than even the most interminable Boycott innings – but it has come to pass, as the prophet foretold.It was Christmas 1979 then as now, England had just been walloped by Australia Boycott had batted through an otherwise hopeless second innings in Perth for an unbeaten 99. On the  sports pages, Frank Keating wrote a column of pastiche carols. One went as follows:Away in AustraliaNo place for a babeKeep down his bald head.Come one, come one,Come one and p’raps two!Takes guard for me ’n’ you.The headline read: “Silent Knight, Holy Knight …” Holy perhaps silent never, Boycott has finally achieved his apotheosis. Arise, Sir Geoffrey! And this time it’s serious. But in keeping with the nature of both Sir G and his benefactor, Theresa May, it took just hours to turn messy.The notion of knighting Boycott predates that verse. It started with chuntering among his always numerous devotees, probably after he scored his 100th first-class hundred, with a theatricality that had previously been well hidden, in the 1977 Headingley Ashes Test.But he was always a isive figure. There was his batting, notable for its skill and tenacity but also for its turgidity and self-absorption, tending towards selfishness.There is his character: sometimes generous often staggeringly insensitive. There is his self‑referential commentary. I wrote a column criticising him during the last Ashes, when England were losing again and he was coming out of every media orifice abusing them by talking about himself. The response was massive and ran about 2-1 in Boycott’s favour. Opinions among those who actually knew him were more evenly ided.The knighthood idea faded in the 1980s after the storm following his sacking as Yorkshire captain, which for bitterness and vituperation was a worthy precursor of Brexit. Keating kept the “Sir Geoffrey” line going as a running gag, though the joke faded somewhat after Boycott’s 1998 conviction in a French court for assaulting a girlfriend.This is what came back to haunt him on Tuesday, when domestic violence campaigners spoke up. He handled that court case with the same tin-eared hopelessness that he showed again this week on the Today programme.Martha Kearney: “The chief executive of Women’s Aid has said …”Sir G: “I don’t care a toss about ’er, luv.”But his anger may not be without foundation. His biographer Leo McKinstry, in a fair-minded and well-researched account of the trial, is very convincing that the verdict was at best unsafe and at worst unjust.The honours system is rarely forgiving. Lester Piggott, Britain’s greatest jockey, remains unknighted more than 30 years after being imprisoned for tax fraud. And Boycott may also have stayed shaken and un-sirred but for a single admirer, handily placed.Years ago May outed herself as a Boycott-lover she admired his doggedness. And in 2015, the Mail on Sunday reported that May, then home secretary, had been blocked from adding him to the honours list officials cited the French conviction. The following year May was promoted. And from then on it was only a matter of time.I sometimes think that securing Boycott’s knighthood was her main policy aim at No 10. However, even prime ministers have only limited control over the honours list – until they quit and have a single chance to go crazy. Harold Wilson’s “Lavender List” remains infamous for its awards to shabby cronies, but it is always an irresistible chance to reward one’s mates. One could see this coming a mile off. Boycs knew, of course, and a source reports that he was “unusually convivial” during the Old Trafford Test.What’s astonishing about May’s list is that Boycott and Andrew Strauss were the only people rewarded for something other than sustaining her in office, Strauss’s knighthood being more surprising if less controversial.The normal going rate for cricketing knighthoods has long been about one a decade. I theorised that the inclusion of Sir Alastair Cook in January was a Whitehall attempt to see off Boycott. A Baldrickian plan, it transpires. Instead, she has doubled down.England could have done with Boycott this summer, even batting with his stick of rhubarb. But where are Sir Ben, Sir Stuart, Sir Jimmy and Sir Jofra? Well, Fred Trueman once said ruefully that no bowler had been knighted since Sir Francis Drake, which is true-ish. In 2005, when England actually won the Ashes, Tony Blair handed out MBEs all round. That, however, was a political stunt rather than self-indulgence.One way and another what might have been Boycott’s ultimate triumph and vindication has been tainted. Naturally the Labour party had to give him a kicking too which, from my experience of attacking him, may not be helpful among elderly male voters in the Yorkshire marginals.Sir Geoffrey has devoted his life to his sport. And his greatest gift to it has been that, since he first came to public consciousness circa 1963, he has been a constant topic of argument. And still is, rising 79. What else could have engaged us so much all these years? What on earth? And if I have any hopes for heaven, they include the wish that somewhere up there, Frank Keating is chuckling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9939d34ff5e0b95598e724db3da287b55ebc1c5/374_242_5066_3040/master/5066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8954048ccd7154b83f46371b9ffdbbe5","title":"joe root england cricket formats ecb ashes","story":"The weather seemed to turn last week, and the conversation with it. All of a sudden it was autumn and, since what it’s like out is one of the few reliable topics of conversation in this country, friends sent despairing messages from Old Trafford complaining about how bitterly cold it was in the stands. The cricket season’s still got another fortnight‑and‑some to run, there’s this last Test at the Oval, and two more rounds of County Championship matches after the current one. They’ll be sweeping great piles of dead leaves from the outfield by the time it finishes on 26 September, six months and two weeks after the counties played their first warm-up games back in the middle of March.The approach of the England and Wales Cricket Board to scheduling is something like a teenager’s to tidying their room, they just keep stuffing things in to the space they have. Sooner or later, the wardrobe is going to split open at the hinges. Next year it will be even messier, because everything is being rearranged around the Hundred, which will run through July and August, overlapping with the county one-day competition, a one‑day and a T20 series against Australia (gratuitous in one sense, not the other), and a Test and T20 series against Pakistan. “There will,” the ECB chief executive, Tom Harrison, said earlier this summer, “be some inevitable challenges with scheduling.” He made it sound as if it was beyond his control.Well, so much the better for all us spectators, who will be spoiled for choice. It’s the players who will struggle. Take Joe Root. You may have missed it in between his being lbw to Josh Hazlewood for 71 and being bowled by Pat Cummins for a duck, but Root actually reached a century at Old Trafford last week. The second day of the fourth Test was the 100th day in the last 365 that Root has spent playing cricket for England, Yorkshire and the Sydney Thunder. Most of the rest were spent on planning meetings, press conferences, gym and net sessions and all that travel, around and across England, Sri Lanka, Australia and the West Indies.The very first weekend after England won the World Cup, the players were already back in camp getting ready for the Ashes. “It’d be wrong to say I’m not,” Root said when asked if he was feeling tired a week later. “It’s been 10 weeks of hard cricket, high emotions, ups and downs, and it does take a lot out of you.” There was no point in his pretending otherwise, since the answer was written all over his face anyway. You can even see it at the crease, where his technique has grown frayed and worn, and his nimble, impish energy has been receded into a leaden determination, as though all he has left to run on are the fumes of his resolve.Root has already played more innings, and faced more balls, in international cricket than any other batsman since he made his debut in December 2012, and the pattern has repeated itself this year. He has played 103 days of cricket in the last 365, Virat Kohli 88, Kane Williamson 87, and Steve Smith 50. Root has played 40 innings in international cricket this year, Kohli 32, Williamson 27, Smith 15. Root doesn’t asking for sympathy, and wouldn’t get much anyway since a lot of the workload is because he is so keen to play in all three formats of the sport. It was his choice to spend January in Australia playing in the Big Bash, after all.“It is what it is,” Root said. But it’s not. It is what it oughtn’t to be. Root’s difficulties are part of a wider problem. It was only in 2013 that England and Australia scheduled two Ashes series back-to-back so that they could stop the series from clashing with the World Cup, and yet here we are, six years later, with the two events squeezed side‑by‑side into the same summer. As it has worked out, England and Australia both got what they deserved out of these past few months of cricket. The English had spent most of the past four years preparing for the World Cup, the Australians for the Ashes.The ECB imagined it could have both. The model Andrew Strauss had in mind when he took over as England’s director of cricket in 2015 was the great Australia team that dominated Test and one-day cricket around the turn of the century. But they didn’t have to wrestle with T20 cricket, let alone the Hundred, didn’t have to worry about how their best players were going to fit in franchise cricket. The question for the next generation, then, is whether it is ever going to be possible for any one player, or any one team, to dominate all the formats of the sport, or whether the demands of red- and white-ball cricket have grown both so intense and so far apart that it is impossible for anyone to successfully  both for any length of time.England’s experiment with picking the same players for both has certainly backfired on them this summer. And it is not going to get any more straightforward for whoever takes over from Trevor Bayliss as head coach. Strauss’s successor, Ashley Giles, has repeatedly said that the England team’s emphasis is going to be on winning the World T20 in Australia next winter. And next summer England’s best players – Root, Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer, Jos Buttler – will be split switching between the Pakistan Test series and the Hundred, every bit as keen to play on the BBC in the ECB’s lavishly resourced new format as they are in what we all call “the pinnacle of the sport”. It feels like too much of a good thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e64d0ccdf99c93ec52ab9b2b178a880c6bfd27cd/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7637a9f96086e8c50a74cbbef6ef0157","title":"rugby world cup 2019 canada team guide","story":"Kingsley Jones has rebuilt Canada after picking up the pieces from the fallout of the last World Cup but they need to put it all together in JapanKingsley Jones has rebuilt Canada after picking up the pieces from the fallout of the last World Cup but they need to put it all together in JapanThe last time Canada played in Japan was six years ago. They’d played four days before, halfway around the world in Toronto. Their body clocks thought it was six in the morning when the game kicked off in pouring rain in Nagoya. Despite all that, the Kieran Crowley-coached squad lost only 16-13 to Eddie Jones’s men. The Canadians of that era beat the likes of Georgia, Fiji, the USA and Tonga regularly. Four years ago in England at the World Cup, Canada knew they could make big strides forward in their rugby development. There’s an alternate reality to consider from what actually occurred, where Canada hold on to beat Italy and avoid a tragic collapse against Romania, a loss pulled from the clutches of victory. If they had done that double, they would have qualified directly for 2019, yielding a positive feedback loop: a bigger dose of World Rugby funding, higher profile November Tests and so on. Instead, after the World Cup, Crowley fell out with Rugby Canada management after eight years in charge and took a job in Italy. His replacement, Mark Anscombe, lasted barely more than a year the players chafed under his coaching style and the on-field performance, only two wins in 15 Tests, reflected the dysfunction. Enter Kingsley Jones, hired to replace Anscombe in the autumn of 2017. The former Wales international had coached at the highest levels in the UK but also knew plenty about running a minor national squad from his time with Russia earlier this decade. He had to do two things in short order: rebuild his struggling squad and qualify for Japan. The former is ongoing, with half his squad veterans of the Crowley era. The latter? Well they made it and once again this is a big tournament for Canada. Their schedule is punishing, four games in 17 days. Maybe there are two wins in there: the Canadians again have the Italians in their sights for an upset and they close the tournament against Namibia, who have never recorded a win at a World Cup. (In between, are matches against South Africa and New Zealand, where the goal is to simply minimise the damage.) In reality, eyes really should be set on 2023. For one thing, Kingsley Jones has more professionals to consider than his predecessors did, thanks to Major League Rugby. By the head coach’s count, there are now 45 Canadian players in the two-year-old US-based competition (including a Toronto-based Canadian entry, the Arrows). Add another dozen or so who play overseas, like the captain, Tyler Ardron, of Super Rugby’s Chiefs, or Glasgow’s world-class winger DTH van der Merwe and Jones has nearly nearly twice as many professionals to pick from compared to when he first arrived. Under Jones, Canada have shown moments of promise. The defence hasn’t been as consistently lost at sea as it was under Anscombe. The scrum is much more stable than it was under Crowley but the lineout has had struggles. The backline remains Canada’s strength, a hard-running group with a knack for finishing.

Now, in a powerful play about death in custody, he’s making a fresh bid for stardom ‘People are going to come to the show thinking ‘Does Richard think he’s going to pull this off? OK, let’s see.’” Richard Blackwood is taking his best guess at the motivations of the audience at London’s Soho theatre. When I meet him at the start of a run of Typical – the one-man show he starred in at the Edinburgh fringe and which has now transferred – his mood is pugilistic.The show is a retelling of the real-life story of British-Nigerian Christopher Alder, a commended and decorated paratrooper from Hull, who died on the floor of a Humberside police station while officers stood around, with some accused of making monkey noises. It’s a shocking story that playwright Ryan Calais Cameron decided to retell with the permission of Alder’s family.You might think the challenging, staccato text is beyond an actor whose last major role was on EastEnders. That’s exactly what Blackwood is banking on. “You’re going to think I can only be funny, you’re going to think that I can’t do an accent,” he says. “And then I’m going to blow you out the park.”Blackwood, who remembers the Alder case at the time, admits he struggled with the complexities of the play at first but now sees the casting as fate. “I believe that the role was written for me to play,” he says. “I don’t think it was a fluke. I don’t think it was accident. I think that it’s very much my calling to do this.”More muscly than in his late-90s pomp, when Blackwood tells a painful story his face contorts and the specks of grey in his hair and his wrinkles give the narrative added weight. It’s not hard to see him play a middle-aged black British man who has been chewed up and spat out by life, because something similar happened to him.At the turn of the millennium, Blackwood – the stepbrother of Naomi Campbell – was one of the UK’s biggest entertainment stars. He had his own chatshow, he co-hosted on Top of the Pops and he’d just signed a £1m record contract. Dubbed the “British Will Smith”, Blackwood had every reason to believe that a lucrative career on the other side of the Atlantic was awaiting him. “I was just in this bubble thinking I had the Midas touch,” he says. “Hollywood felt like a given. When I got signed in America I thought, ‘OK, I’m now ready for the next stage.’”Blackwood says Hollywood was always the dream as a schoolboy he had memorised Eddie Murphy’s hit standup special, Delirious, in its entirety. Blackwood was signed by veteran agent Jeff Berg, who arranged meetings between him and major directors and producers, but there was just one problem: Blackwood couldn’t act.Hosting TV shows, he could rely on his improvisational skills, but when he went for a meeting with Terminator: Salvation director McG, who had just had a hit with Charlie’s Angels, it dawned on him that his big chance had come too early and he couldn’t ad-lib his way out of it. “I came in to his house in the Hollywood hills and he was watching a video of me on the big screen,” says Blackwood, who was preparing to appear in Fastlane, a cop show set in New York. “So McG says: ‘You can do a New York accent, right?’ I said, ‘No, I can’t.’ He just looked at me. I was out of my comfort zone.”McG was telling Blackwood how he had him in mind for a remake of Walter Hill’s The Warriors, but without the acting chops, he knew the dream was about to turn sour. “I wanted to shout, ‘Stop!’ Because it was like, ‘I can’t do all these things, that’s not me.’ When I came back home, that’s when I realised you look at America, and want to be out there so bad. But you need to be ready for America.”Out in LA, Blackwood’s life started to unravel. He was staying in the expensive Beverly Wilshire hotel because, he was told, a future star needed to look the part. But no money was coming in and when auditions failed to generate roles, his costs on both sides of the Atlantic began to mount. In 2003, a combination of debt and the implosion of his personal life drove him to try to take his own life.“Bankruptcy happened, my son’s mother left me, and my grandmother – who is essentially like my mother – went into hospital before she died, on the same day,” says Blackwood. “I was broken. One of those things was enough to kill you but all three happening on one day was too much.” An ex-girlfriend stopped Blackwood from going through with it. “It could have gone that way and if it wasn’t for her I would not be here.”But for all the talk of America, it’s the UK where Blackwood feels he still has a point to prove. “I don’t want to be overlooked over here any more,” he says. “I’m not just average. I never have been.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92319aabef2f67e5c56289cbb8bde2fb9ac7bb89/0_304_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88671c44afc567278b44d1c0ac6072c4","title":"apple tv a canny way to compete with netflix","story":"Apple had few treats for those avid followers who tuned in to the company’s press event this week. Three new phones, all thoroughly leaked in advance a new basic iPad with a slightly larger screen and a new Apple Watch with a face that never turns off.Not everything was predictable. It’s just we had to take the surprises where we found them.Case in point: Apple TV+. You would be forgiven for missing that the company’s most meaningful announcement came in the section where it largely repeated news it had already revealed back in March. Yet surprise there was.The streaming service is launching with a panoply of star-filled titles (though few that look good: Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon may be able pull off dramedy in The Morning Show, but judging by its abysmal trailer, Jason Momoa’s See is likely to be less successful).The service will be priced at just $5 (£4) a month. Yet most won’t even be paying that, since a year’s subscription will also come free with any purchase of an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac.It’s a canny answer to the obvious question asked since Apple TV+ was announced: how is this thing going to compete with Netflix? The service had big exclusives, but seemed to lack the sort of backlist that can reliably answer the question: “What shall we watch tonight?” Without that content, it was always going to be difficult to convince people to drop their Netflix subscriptions for Apple TV+.Now we know that was never the intention. In fact, at least in the immediate future, the goal is not to make money from Apple TV+ directly at all, since a substantial proportion of the desired user base will qualify for the free year.This is where things get slightly confusing, of course, because there are two things called Apple TV. The first is the marginally successful set-top-box that Apple sells to sit under your TV. Since its relaunch a few years back as an app platform to sit alongside iOS, watchOS and macOS, the Apple TV range has struggled to justify itself in the homes of many: if all you do is watch the two or three largest streaming services, it’s wildly overpowered and overpriced compared with the competition from Roku or Amazon.But that’s where the second Apple TV comes in – the TV app, which runs not only on the TV hardware, but also on Macs, iPads and iPhones. The app combines TV and movies from every streaming provider, letting users jump between shows from different services, combine their algorithmic recommendations, and pick up where they left off across devices.It’s also intended to be a revenue-raiser for Apple through the Channels service, which lets users subscribe to inidual TV channels and watch the content in the app. Great for those services without the clout for their own standalone streaming app, but which still have some exclusive content – and great for Apple sitting in the middle.There’s just one problem: the TV app is not supported by Netflix, which means a substantial chunk of Apple customers never even open it.And so, Apple TV+. Suddenly, a growing proportion of Apple customers have subscription to a buzzy streaming service only accessible through the TV app. At least on paper, that subscription is worth $60 a year. All it takes is one show to catch on for those viewers, and they get in the habit of opening the TV app, at least weekly, to watch the new episodes, placing Apple in the lucrative middleman position in yet another industry.It’s a solid bet. The only flaw is Jason Momoa. Sorry, pal. Maybe Jennifer Aniston will have more luck?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e135ee2f3678b50060b607f24e36e9baa4227a48/457_196_1106_664/master/1106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3041b5ee6c98096583f24248d5bfa2a5","title":"simple tips for blitzing your work to do list","story":"You don’t need to master mindfulness or download a complicated productivity app to stay on top of your adminEver get to that stage where you seem to be spending all your time and energy just putting things off? You know you should get stuff done but you find yourself weighed down by the tyranny of your to-do list.And, of course, the more you put something off, the larger the looming shadow it casts. This is particularly insidious when it comes to dull-but-essential tasks, such as admin.And if you’re running a small business, it can be even harder to discipline yourself, especially if you’re working on your own or from home. Moreover, the burden of business admin can feel particularly oppressive, sapping your ability to focus on growing your company.The internet is full of life hacks and tips to help you break this cycle of inertia. But all-too-often the suggestions feel like just another thing to add to your to-do list. Likewise, techniques for improving your time management can sometimes seem a bit, well, time-consuming.Happily, however, there are a number of quick-and-easy tips that you can implement immediately – whether it’s advice for beating procrastination, resisting unhelpful impulses or countering your phobia of finances.For instance, when it comes to tackling the urge to check your social media, try thinking about how bad you’d feel in the near future having failed to complete the task at hand.Or if you’re trying to avoid procrastinating, tell someone else your intended goals for that particular day. This will make you feel more accountable – after all, it’s harder to break an intention that you’ve declared to others than it is to break a promise that you’ve made to yourself.There are also practical techniques for tackling some of the peskier admin tasks that tend to linger on people’s to-do lists – such as nailing your tax return, managing your web presence, and getting the correct kind of business insurance.1. Beat procrastinationProcrastinating doesn’t mean you’re workshy. It’s more likely to mean you’re just trying to stop yourself from feeling bad – either because you have to do something you’d rather not, or you’re worried you won’t be able to complete the task. So, try to focus on the positive outcome instead.2. Control your impulsesIn a world increasingly governed by instant gratification and the addictiveness of our smartphones, the ability to control our impulses is essential to getting things done. But try to think of this as a two-stage process: first, resist the temptation by making it harder to act on that initial urge – for instance by locking your phone in a drawer so you can’t check social media. And, second, maintain that resistance by consciously forming new positive habits.3. Overcome your financial phobiaAdmin avoidance can stem from a general anxiety about financial literacy. According to Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist and author, one way to combat this is to find yourself a financial mentor: “A great way to challenge your beliefs is to find someone who’s a step or two ahead, pick their brains, and become a student of their money mindset.”4. Tackle time managementOne simple trick is to try to become more aware of the value of each moment. “Remember every task comes with a cost,” says podcaster and author Ellen Hendriksen. “Be mindful about what task you are choosing to spend your time on, because that is time not doing other tasks.”5. Find your flowBeing “in the zone” or achieving a “flow state” can give us the focus and energy to perform at our best. One trick is to insulate yourself from tasks that might otherwise distract you by scheduling time in the week to do all the bits of admin that would otherwise intrude.6. Tooling yourself upThe popular idiom holds that a bad worker always blames their tools, but perhaps the opposite is also true: a good worker will always give them credit. Having the right kit helps you signal to yourself your intention to do a job well. In short, if we have good tools, we’re more likely to look forward to using them.7. Nail your tax returnAdopt so-called “microproductivity” methods by breaking this annual round of torture into a series of smaller tasks. These can then fit into those little moments of spare time we occasionally find ourselves with. For instance, try to view each figure that you need to obtain as a distinct task to be completed on its own.8. Manage your web presenceOne byproduct of ramping up your web presence is you can be inundated with demand that you can’t meet. “You turn your advertising off then,” says Jimmy McCann, head of digital strategy at Search Laboratory, which helps clients with online advertising. “It would also be worth having an overflow network to pass stuff on to and get a kickback.”9. Prepare a loan pitchSometimes a business needs a cash injection – whether it’s for upgrading equipment or premises, or just a bridging loan to help with a short-term cashflow problem. However, asking for money and demonstrating an ability to repay it can be stressful and time-consuming. Try to minimise the anxiety and avoid the possible pitfalls by being realistic about your projections – that way you can give a solid timeframe for repayments.10. Get insuredIt can be tempting to put off taking out business insurance. It can linger at the bottom of your to-do list because of the complacent attitude that “it won’t happen to us”. Part of the problem is that many people don’t appreciate the sheer number of possible hazards that exist in the workplace and their potential fallout – whether from accidental damage, disruption or injury. Often, it’s the anticipated complexity of sorting out cover, rather than the cost, that puts people off. But getting the right cover can be simpler than you’d think.For expanded advice on how to overcome common obstacles to getting things done, go to thewhats-stopping-you"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5bde3b34b1b78ffd31357bee6b7b4601def5170/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a95277452bf6b90126acff78d9f2649","title":"she said book harvey weinstein twohey kantor","story":"Journalists Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor spoke to the  about their sprawling investigation into Weinstein’s alleged sexual predation as detailed in their new bookOn Wednesday, 4 October 2017, the New York Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor were finalizing their exposé of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the now-disgraced movie producer, when they received a disorienting call: Weinstein, from whom they were expecting a final statement after months of intense investigative work, was approaching the building.In minutes, he’d be on their doorstep with a small army of powerful supporters in tow – including the feminist lawyer Lisa Bloom and the former sex crimes prosecutor Linda Fairstein – in a last-ditch effort to kill their story. After months of on-record only communication, would they take the meeting?The fittingly cinematic episode is one of many explosive revelations in She Said, Twohey and Kantor’s book detailing their sprawling investigation into Weinstein’s alleged sexual predation – which won a Pulitzer, along with Ronan Farrow’s exposé for the New Yorker – and its aftermath as gasoline for the #MeToo movement.Twohey and Kantor’s 3,300-word article, the first of many on Weinstein, triggered an avalanche of women’s accounts of sexual harassment and assault under the hashtag #MeToo, first coined years earlier by the activist Tarana Burke. Since then, the tide of pent-up frustration and calls for accountability have exposed and stalled the careers of prominent men such as Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose and Les Moonves, to name a few. (Weinstein, whose criminal trial for rape and predatory sexual assault has been delayed until January 2020, has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex and pleaded not guilty.)The final showdown with Weinstein is just one of several revelations in She Said that portend a much deeper story than the one which seized headlines two years ago.“We pretty quickly realized that our first Weinstein articles were actually just the beginning,” Twohey told the  in an interview. “With this book, we were able to piece together so many more pieces of the puzzle.”Supporting these bombshells are a mountain of smaller, quieter yet still powerful actions – Kantor fielding nervous texts from Gwyneth Paltrow as she deliberated going on the record (which she ultimately did in the second article, published on 10 October), or crafting the perfectly calibrated email to coax the actor Rose McGowan into a phone call. There’s Twohey, knocking on the door of a woman who mysteriously left Weinstein’s company in 1990, skillfully volleying small talk into an interview pitch. And there’s an email from Laura Madden, one of the first women to go on the record against Weinstein, recounting how a conversation with her teenage daughters anchored her decision to speak.More than anything, She Said depicts the incremental work of pulling at long-neglected threads as well as the institutional heft and inidual bravery required to hold powerful abuses to account.But She Said goes much deeper than a compelling play-by-play of nailing the first Weinstein story. The immediate aftermath of publication, when the dam broke on story after story of sexual indignity, workplace harassment, or assault, “only made us feel greater responsibility”, Kantor told the .“We said to ourselves: we’ve got to try to finally answer some of these lingering questions from the Weinstein story. How can a company become so complicit in predation? What are the systems that enable this kind of abuse? In the face of a “staggering” wave of personal and institutional responses, said Twohey, “We just decided that the most important thing we could do was keep reporting.”That reporting unmasked a decades-long culture of complicity at the Weinstein Company and its forerunner, Miramax, which prized protection from liability over protection of women, and a shadowy cottage industry of out-of-court settlements for victims of harassment and assault sealed with punishing non-disclosure agreements.One Weinstein accuser, Zelda Perkins, revealed to Kantor and Twohey an agreement which prohibited her from discussing her employment at Miramax with anyone, including talking to a therapist without a confidentiality agreement, or even obtaining a full copy of the contract.But a brave few did speak out and the book reveals their personal journeys to going public for the first time: Laura Madden, the first woman to speak out against Weinstein on-record in an interview, who participated days before a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery for breast cancer. Rowena Chiu, who didn’t tell her family about her 1998 settlement with Weinstein until after Kantor arrived at her Silicon Valley home, now on the record for the first time. And Perkins, formerly of the Miramax London office, who “always had a larger vision of what this was about”, said Kantor. “She said even as early as that, this isn’t about getting Harvey this is about an entire system that silences women.”In the preface, Kantor and Twohey explicitly pose the question: did the cultural change go too far? Or not far enough?It’s less the reporters’ paradigm than “the question we saw play out in the world”, said Kantor. “We experienced the power of the post-Weinstein reckoning and this feeling of buried truth pouring out – this display of mass accountability without precedent.”But they also watched the conversations around #MeToo get complicated, and polarizing. The past two years have revealed “three questions about #MeToo that remain totally unresolved”, said Kantor – what behaviors are under scrutiny? What tools can evaluate truth? And what are the appropriate measures for accountability and punishment?Nearly a year ago, Kantor and Twohey watched as a previously unknown psychology professor from Palo Alto, California, testified before the Senate judiciary committee about her allegation of sexual assault, in high school, by the then supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The final two chapters of She Said follow the personal journey of Dr Christine Blasey Ford as she deliberated over going public with her story – a journey more fraught than previously revealed.The book recounts a meeting, earlier this year, of several high-profile figures of the #MeToo stories – Ford, Paltrow, Madden and others as they reflect on the personal effects of coming forward and ponder the unresolved questions of the movement. What is clear, said Kantor, is that “none of us are done dealing with what’s happened in the past. You can’t fix a problem you can’t see. And it’s become clear that all of us collectively are still in the process of seeing this problem clearly.”For the book, part of that clarity resides in upholding and demystifying the “rigorous standards” of investigative journalism. “At a time when even the truth can feel so compromised and everything can feel so stuck, I want them to believe in that power, that potential.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593885edf55947b880c7bb88bbe5fa86aac1fe40/0_39_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be3a02f2a7bc6c8164cc1a3344e5b3ed","title":"arab leaders denounce netanyahu plan annex palestinian territories israel","story":"Israeli prime minister’s proposal would ‘kill all chances of peace’, says JordanArab leaders have denounced Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to annex large swathes of the Palestinian territories if he is re-elected next week as an election stunt that would “kill all chances for peace”.The Arab League held an emergency session on Tuesday evening after the Israeli prime minister announced the plan in a live press conference.Netanyahu, who is fighting for his political life before elections on 17 September, said he would permanently seize up to a third of the West Bank, a move that for decades has been considered an endgame scenario for Palestinians’ aspirations of statehood.Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo condemned the plan as “a dangerous development and a new Israeli aggression by declaring the intention to violate the international law”.“The league regards these statements as undermining the chances of any progress in the peace process and will torpedo all its foundations,” the ministers said.Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said Netanyahu’s plan was an outrageous election ploy and a “dangerous escalation that shatters the foundations of the peace process”.Netanyahu made the announcement in front of a large map showing Israeli sovereignty extending over the vast majority of the Jordan Valley and slicing off the eastern border with Jordan.“Killing all chances for peace for electoral purposes is irresponsible, dangerous,” Safadi added in a tweet.Turkey’s foreign minister said the plan was racist and incendiary. “The election promise of Netanyahu, who is giving all kind of illegal, unlawful and aggressive messages before the election, is a racist apartheid state,” Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu wrote on Twitter.“Will defend rights and interests of our Palestinian brothers \u0026amp sisters till the end,” he added.The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, said he would pull out of any previous agreements signed with the Israeli government if it went ahead with the move – a threat he has previously made without following through.Ayman Odeh, the leader of an alliance of Arab parties in Israel, called Netanyahu’s statement “not just election spin” but “a vision of apartheid”.A White House official said there had been no change in US policy and would not comment further.Late on Tuesday evening, Netanyahu was dragged away by his security team from a campaign rally in the southern city of Ashdod after air sirens sounded. The Israeli military said two rockets had been launched from Gaza, both of which were intercepted by its aerial defence system.Despite the implications for a future two-state solution, Arab states would be under significant pressure not to escalate if the annexation went ahead, analysts said.The fate of the Palestinians has diminished as a priority in many Arab capitals as the geopolitics of the region has shifted. Saudi Arabia and Israel share an interest in combating Iranian influence in the Middle East. Jordan and Egypt have long ago signed peace treaties with Israel, easing the flow of American aid and military equipment on which both depend.Significant implications are likely to be felt across the border with the West Bank in Amman. “Jordan has real existential fears with any outcome other than a two-state solution,” said Osama al-Sharif, a Jordanian analyst and columnist.Roughly 2 million Palestinians live in Jordan, most of them naturalised but barred from certain jobs on the basis they will one day be able to return to their own state. Jordanians living in the East Bank also fear that Israeli consolidation of its occupied territories could push new waves of refugees into Jordan, at a time when the country is already hosting an estimate 1.4 million Syrian refugees.The international community considers Israeli settlements illegal under international law, with many built on land confiscated from Palestinian families. Extending Israeli sovereignty over such a large area would also be seen as putting an end to fading hopes for a Palestinian state, as there would be little unbroken land on which to create it.Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital early in his term further damaged the two-state ideal. The Palestinians regard the occupied eastern section of Jerusalem as the capital of any future state, and cut contact with Washington after the declaration.Earlier this year, Trump also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel captured from Syria in the same 1967 conflict and annexed in 1981. The move broke from the international consensus following the second world war that forbids territorial conquest during war.In Israeli politics, annexation is a popular position. Israel has long stated it would want to keep the 2,400 sq km (927 sq mile) Jordan Valley to maintain control over the international border."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eefe383ac252d564b10ad3eccf66f7d77ed69116/0_257_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e02f665f6cbd05b0cc177ea7efaf1ea2","title":"bahamas hurricane dorian treasure cay recovery cleanup","story":"Twenty miles north of Abaco’s biggest town, Treasure Cay faces the daunting challenge of recovery and clean-up after the hurricane left it looking like a ‘war zone’Visitors to Treasure Cay in the Bahamas used to enjoy a traditional dish of steamed grouper with jasmine rice and coleslaw prepared by executive chef Antone Dames.“I’d do anything for that now,” Dames said, contemplating whether he has a long-term future here.The 40-year-old and his family were in their condominium last week when Hurricane Dorian tore into Abaco Island with fearful velocity. He recalled: “At about three or four in the afternoon, the bottom window blew out and the wind tried to pull my family outside. I was holding my wife’s hand and she was holding our son’s hand they were off their feet and in the air for at least 10 minutes. My arm still hurts. We went to the bathroom and the whole roof came off. I was as scared as hell. I thought I was going to die.”The Italian bistro that Dames opened last year was destroyed by the storm and now he does not know what his future holds – or where it will be. “We put a lot of work into it and it’s gone, just like that. Now I’m going to start my whole life over. Start at the bottom,” he said.His wife, Martha, 40, took their traumatized 11-year-old son Antwoine to Nassau, the Bahamian capital. But on Tuesday Dames was at the local airport awaiting delivery of supplies including food, water and batteries. He said there is a plan to rebuild Treasure Cay, but he is waiting to see what terms he is offered before making a decision.Twenty miles north of Abaco’s biggest town, Marsh Harbour, Treasure Cay boasts a luxury resort with a beach rated one of the best in the world. The rich own second homes here and there are golf courses and tennis courts. One tennis net is twisted but still up and many beachfront villas survived Dorian relatively unscathed. It is still possible to stand on their decks overlooking the turquoise ocean and imagine paradise.But as another plane load of people departed Treasure Cay’s modest airport, the daunting, multi-year, multibillion-dollar challenge of how to rebuild – and even whether to rebuild – Abaco and other affected Bahamian islands is looming large.Jim Keady, an American volunteering for the Humanitarian Aid and Rescue Project, said: “This is just as bad as any war zone that one might see. Everywhere you walk into communities that were hardest hit, you can smell death.”Traveling with the NGO Team Rubicon UK on Tuesday, the  witnessed how a major bridge had collapsed into an inlet, plunging giant chunks of concrete below water and twisting steel barriers out of shape. In the surrounding area vehicles have been spun upside down, trees broken like twigs and power cables snapped.Speaking at the Cooper’s Town community clinic, Keady, 47, commented: “The infrastructure is completely clobbered. All the electricity has gone, the water’s gone and the other thing is that the people are gone. You have so many people who have left the island that we now have another wave of climate refugees.“I did a ride around yesterday with one of the top guys at the ministry of works here just processing what will need to be done: the amount of front-end loaders, bulldozers, mulching machines, cranes. There’s going to have to be some really difficult decisions made by the central government here in the Bahamas on whether or not you rebuild. From what I have seen, you’ve just got to bulldoze a lot of these neighborhoods and then decide, are we going to rebuild something here?”Keady suggested that the situation will become unsustainable for residents in seven to 10 days, especially if aid dries up, making evacuation the only option. “I just came from the airport in Treasure Cay. A plane landed, we were unloading medical supplies and there were people running up with their passports begging to get on a plane to anywhere in Florida. And you have to tell them no. It breaks your heart. You’ve got a mother in tears crying for herself and her son, ‘I just want to get him out of here.’ This is the reality facing people here.”Keady, who has been involved in local politics in New Jersey, insisted that global heating was a crucial factor in the category 5 hurricane.“The surface temperatures of the water are so much higher than they would have been and that’s just fuel for storms that in the past would have moved along and did some damage. We had a storm stall for two days, crushing the Bahamas,” he said.“Donald Trump is a fool with regard to the climate crisis. You don’t have to be a climate scientist you just need to be paying attention and looking at what is happening.”Although much of Abaco is eerily deserted, and the Treasure Cay community centre lies dark and silent with rows of books and a calendar frozen in August, there is a slow trickle of people into the next door medical centre, where volunteers from Heart to Heart International are providing free treatment.Wilson Charite, 61, who came to the clinic because of his blood pressure, said of the hurricane: “My house was flooded. The water broke the front door and carried everything out. We had one little ladder inside so we put all the children on the roof. “Everyone was crying. I said: ‘Don’t cry, the roof isn’t going to go away.’ I thought, if the roof goes, all my children will be lost.”His daughter, Wilsonithe, 14, added: “We were on the roof for a night. The house was shaking. It was like the house was going to tumble over. I felt like I was going to die.”Clint Laroda, 60, required attention to his hand after trying to ride out the storm in a beach club. “I was opening the door to get my family out and the hurricane slammed the door and amputated the tip of my finger,” he said. But he remains optimistic about the future of Treasure Cay. “I think it can be rebuilt.

So Canadians have an important choice to make. Will we go back to the failed policies of the past, or will we continue to move forward?” Trudeau told reporters gathered outside Payette’s residence, Rideau Hall.The prime minister also used his speech to make sharp distinctions between his administration and a potential government led by the Conservative party.“It’s going to be different from elections we’ve seen over the last couple of decades. There’s deep polarisation in the country,” said Frank Graves, president of the polling company EKOS Research. “On issues such as climate change, immigration and attitudes towards public institutions, the isions have never been starker.”The upcoming campaign will last nearly six weeks: half the length of the marathon campaign of 2015, when voters endured almost 80 days of mudslinging by political leaders – a brief dash compared to US elections, but a marathon for Canada.Trudeau, who swept to office in November 2015 promising “sunny ways” and stressing the importance of gender equality and the environment, faces an electorate which will be much more focused on the economy.The country’s 43rd election also comes against the backdrop of protracted political scandal for the incumbent prime minister.For months, Trudeau has faced accusations – including from the country’s ethics commissioner – that he acted improperly when he requested his attorney general to halt criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin.Trudeau and his Liberals are widely expected to use the election to shore up support for his government’s climate change policies, including a nationwide carbon tax. His main opponent, the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, has pledged to repeal the Liberals’ marquee environmental legislation.Scheer, the youngest federal leader and running in his first federal campaign as head of the party, has consistently used the prime minister’s ethical lapses to paint the government as unable to govern effectively.Polling suggests Trudeau and Scheer are deadlocked in the popular vote, but the Liberals hold an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament.Jagmeet Singh, leader of the leftwing New Democratic party, is also running his first federal campaign as a party leader. Despite initial excitement around his role as the first major party leader from a racial minority, the NDP’s finances have collapsed and the party is likely to sustain heavy electoral losses throughout the country. “They are in danger, if they were to slip any more – which I would not rule out – of not forming official party status,” said Graves.Meanwhile, the Green party, led by Elizabeth May, has experienced a surge in support as the climate crises increasingly rates as an important issues for voters.The official start of the campaign comes a day before a highly anticipated leaders’ debate, in which Scheer, Singh and May will spar for the first time on stage. But the televised debate, hosted in Toronto, will have a glaring omission: Trudeau has opted to skip the event, leaving his rivals without a foil.﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cba505bb9e485c890a648f6128878899be718780/0_265_4333_2600/master/4333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d611afe6856840fc2206407bc0b9f2a6","title":"hong kong activist to germany stop selling riot control kit to city","story":"Joshua Wong urges Berlin to halt export of equipment such as water cannon used against protestersThe activist Joshua Wong has called for Germany to stop the export of riot control weapons and equipment to Hong Kong police, as he embarked on a global tour to promote his pro-democracy message.After a meeting with Germany’s foreign minister and ahead of a series of speaking engagements in the US, Wong appealed to Germany to suspend trade negotiations with China until the government of Xi Jinping puts on the agenda human rights laws “that respect European standards”.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world\u0027s most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene.\u0026nbspUnderlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city\u0027s semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong“Hong Kong can serve as an example for the world to learn from,” Wong told the audience at a press conference in Berlin. For too long, the 22-year-old said, authorities in the semi-autonomous region had been unaware of the ways in which the Chinese Communist party used trade to turn its “one country, two systems” motto into “one country, one-and-a-half systems”.“China uses the Belt and Road initiative as a way to increase and expand its economic influence and political gain – not just in Hong Kong, China, Asia Pacific, but also in Europe,” he said.Wong and fellow founders of the Demosisto political party had arrived in the German capital on Monday, where he was feted by politicians and media commentators at a party in the rooftop restaurant of the Reichstag building on Monday night hosted by the tabloid Bild.Hong Kong’s leader,\u0026nbspCarrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw the bill that ignited months of protests. Hong Kong residents had feared it could be used by China to extradite people for political reasons. They want guarantees that it cannot be reintroduced at a later date.Protesters want the government to officially recognise that their movement has been a series of legitimate protests, rather than a riot, as has been stated in official communications.Hundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks, and the protesters are demanding that all of them be freed, and that no convictions should stand against any of them.Police use of force has escalated since the demonstrations began, while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Demonstrators say an inquiry into police brutality is the number-one priority.Hong Kong\u0027s chief executive is currently selected by a 1,200-member committee, and nearly half of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by limited electorates representing different sectors of the economy. The protesters want to be able to vote for their leaders in free and open democratic elections.\u0026nbspA meeting with the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas – photos of which Wong tweeted from his official account – drew anger from the Chinese government, which said the encounter was “disrespectful” of Beijing’s sovereignty.The Chinese ambassador to Germany on Wednesday said the meeting had sent out “very negative signals”, and confirmed his German counterpart in China had been officially summoned by the Beijing foreign ministry in protest. Ambassador Wu Ken added that China had sufficient evidence that foreign forces intervened in Hong Kong during protests.Wong was charged last month with inciting people to join a protest in June, and is out on bail. He was sentenced to two months in prison in May on a contempt charge after pleading guilty to obstructing the clearance of a major protest camp in 2014.Speaking to German media on Wednesday, he said: “The air of freedom I breathe here, instead of the irritative smell of teargas, reminds me how important it is for me to share the thoughts of people who attend the protests in Hong Kong right now.”A meeting with the chancellor, Angela Merkel, who was on a state visit to China last week, did not materialise during his trip, and Wong appeared reluctant to comment on attempts to contact the German leader. His global tour, he said, was focused on meeting with lawmakers to build up bipartisan support for his cause.1 July 1997:\u0026nbspHong\u0026nbspKong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make\u0026nbspHong\u0026nbspKong\u0026nbspdistinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.\u0026nbsp2003:\u0026nbspHong\u0026nbspKong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.\u0026nbsp2007:\u0026nbspThe Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for\u0026nbspHong\u0026nbspKong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation ides Hong\u0026nbspKong\u0027s pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.\u0026nbsp2014:\u0026nbspThe Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong\u0026nbspKong\u0026nbspresidents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of\u0026nbspHong\u0026nbspKong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,\u0026nbspHong\u0026nbspKong\u0026nbsplegislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.\u0026nbsp2019:\u0026nbspLam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill.\u0026nbsp“Next time I come to visit Berlin, it would be great to have the chance to meet with anyone from the office of the foreign minister, or even the chancellor.” Merkel was criticised in parliament on Wednesday morning for failing to arrange a meeting with the protest leader.Wong will meet US media in New York on Friday and move on to Washington next week, where he is seeking to lobby Democratic and Republican politicians to support the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would require the US government to regularly reassess Hong Kong’s level of political autonomy to determine whether it should continue to have a special trade status.In Berlin, Wong said he hoped to carry his pro-democracy message even to China: “First is Hong Kong, next is mainland China.”“We hope for more and more people who live in mainland China to recognise the importance of universal values and freedom. Three decades ago, the Berlin Wall fell, and we hope that in the future, the great firewall of China will also fall.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53070676a7ab0aadb2314588827c77e76932c572/170_12_4598_2760/master/4598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=781f26f6d6425234430b678416cb0664","title":"kashmiri suburb indian control anchar srinagar","story":"Civilians in the Srinagar suburb of Anchar say they are engaged in a fight for existencePrayers had barely finished when the teargas was fired and a trail of smoke arched in the sky. Security forces had launched another assault on Anchar, the only major pocket of resistance in Kashmir.“Others have only heard the word doomsday, we have lived a doomsday,” said Fazi, a grandmother who lives in Anchar, a suburb of Kashmir’s main city, Srinagar, situated on the banks of a lake of the same name.Teargas and pellets were fired into a park near to the shrine where crowds were attending prayers, she said. Residents rushed to the frontline on Anchar’s outskirts, barely 500 metres away, to push back against security forces. She said the assault, on 30 August, lasted five hours.“It was like rain. There were pellets everywhere, smoke everywhere,” she said. “We have no weapons. We have only God’s name and God will do justice with us.”It is now more than five weeks since the Indian government revoked the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir and placed the state under strict lockdown. Many Kashmiris fear that their way of life in India’s only Muslim-majority state is at risk. A heavy troop presence, a communication blackout and widespread detentions have mostly prevented large protests.Paramilitaries control every inch of Srinagar, except Anchar. Residents, mostly creative artisans who weave pashmina shawls, have used JCBs to dig trenches around the neighbourhood. Tin sheets, waste containers, mesh wires and logs have been placed as barricades. At night, teams keep watch to spot if security forces are approaching.It is thought to be the first time in recent decades that civilians in Kashmir have prevented Indian paramilitaries and local police from entering an area. Entire families join in with the efforts. “When we throw a stone, our women are always there to give us a stone,” said one man.“We do it for three reasons,” said Mohammad Subhan, in his early 50s, who was among those who took part in the night watch. “One, so the youth are not detained. Two, so our homes are not ransacked. Three, so the honour of our daughters and women is not violated.”Subhan’s wife and four daughters were at the shrine of Jenab Sahab when the assault began. Like many women, Saima, 22, the eldest daughter, ran to help those defending Anchar.“It is the women who do all the logistics work: they gather the stones, they bring us the water, they bring us salt,” said one man. “It would be impossible to fight without their support.” Saltwater is used to counter the effect of teargas.Saima and two of her sisters – 14-year-old Maysara and 12-year-old Qurat – were wounded by pellets during the assault. A metal pellet pierced Maysara’s eye. She was smuggled to her aunt’s home elsewhere in Srinagar and underwent treatment in hospital.Qurat was wounded in the head. Saima was hit on the neck and arms. “First I felt like hot sand was thrown on me and then I felt my neck is burning,” said Saima.She was treated at the shrine late in the evening by doctors who had been smuggled into the neighbourhood. They administered painkillers and injections to prevent infections.Fazi’s 22-year-old grandson, Bilal, was blinded in his right eye by a pellet. “The bleeding was not stopping, so we sent him to the hospital but doctors said they cannot save his eye,” said Bilal’s father, Mohammad Ramzan. “The doctors recommended that we should take him to a specialised eye hospital outside Kashmir.”He was smuggled out of the city. Ramzan has no idea where his son is or if he is safe.Phone and internet services were suspended last month when the government in Delhi made its revocation announcement. Some landlines have since been restored but these remain unreliable. Few in Kashmir know about the scale of events in Anchar, and few in Anchar dare to leave their neighbourhood.Elsewhere in Srinagar, markets remain shut – an act of defiance on the part of workers, who refuse to comply with the Delhi government’s claim that everything in the region is returning to normal. Public transport also remains shut.The revocation of Kashmir’s special status stripped the region of its constitution and flag. Rules that prevented outsiders from buying land in the territory also disappeared.In Anchar, posters of fighters are pasted across shuttered shops. “Don’t call them militants,” a young man said. “They are mujahideen, they fight for our cause.” Many believe these fighters are their only source of hope in the wake of Delhi’s decision.The Indian government has said its actions will rid the state of terrorism and bring development. It maintains that the situation remains calm. “They say things are normal. What normalcy is this?” said Subhan. “They have shut our main mosques. Jamia Masjid is locked. If this is just the beginning, what will they do afterwards?” He said he would continue to take part in the night watch. “Anchar is fighting for all of Kashmir,” he said.At night-time, groups of youths are stationed along routes into the city. “When the alarm is raised, everyone comes to defend this place,” a college student said at his home where he was recovering from pellet injuries.More than 100 pellets were lodged in his body, neck and head, he said. “It was very painful. When I was hit it was like a hundred needles had pricked me.”Khatija, his mother, said her heart trembled every night as she feared another raid. “God should now have mercy on us,” she said.Khatija’s elder son, a 24-year-old shawl weaver who regularly attends the night guard, said people came out of their houses “like bees” when the alarm of an incoming raid was raised. “We are like one family here, like a folded hand,” he said.He added: “They want to erase us, they want to erase our history. We will not let that happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48c7957273c50af5dd62d2e51ee18802dd782ac0/0_1152_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47e6778d09e29857b6f940336a9af519","title":"underpopulated italian region molise","story":"Molise president finds novel way to breathe life into area as resident numbers dwindleAn underpopulated region in southern Italy is offering newcomers €700 per month for three years to live in one of its villages.There are a few catches, however: the village must have fewer than 2,000 residents, and the newcomer must pledge to open a business.“If we had offered funding, it would have been yet another charity gesture,” Donato Toma, the president of Molise, told the . “We wanted to do more we wanted people to invest here. They can open any sort of activity: a bread shop, a stationery shop, a restaurant, anything. It’s a way to breathe life into our towns while also increasing the population.”Toma also announced that each town with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants would receive €10,000 (£9,000) per month with which it would build infrastructure and promote cultural activities.“It’s not just a matter of increasing the population. People also need infrastructure and a reason to stay, otherwise we’ll end up back where we started in a few years,” he said.According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat), Molise, with a population of 305,000, is among the regions that has lost more inhabitants in recent years – in excess of 9,000 have left since 2014.In 2018, more than 2,800 inhabitants died or moved to another area, almost 1,000 more than the previous year. Not a single birth was registered in nine of its towns.For the first time in 90 years, the number of Italian citizens living in Italy has fallen to about 55 million, according to Istat.In 2014-18 the number of Italian citizens resident in the country fell by 677,000. Two factors are behind the decline, according to experts: a decrease in births, which is at an all-time low since the unification of Italy, and an increase in the migration of young people to other European countries in search of job opportunities. Nearly 157,000 people left the country in 2018, Istat said.Italy is the only major European economy whose population is expected to decline further in the next five years, the UN has said. It ranks second – behind Japan – as the country with the greatest proportion of older people, with an estimated 168.7 over-65s for every 100 young people.In an attempt to resuscitate these towns, several mayors, such as the one in Sutera, in the province of Caltanissetta in Sicily, have opened the doors of their vacant homes to asylum seekers who have crossed the Mediterranean from Libya.Others, such as Sambuca, which are determined do anything it takes to survive, have adopted a strategy that has become fashionable in the south: sell, or practically give away, abandoned homes to anyone willing to move in. The symbolic price of a house is just €1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dfae2e35157d61246911d4f840a12db7532686d/1_23_899_539/master/899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dd6b1499bd7a46a0e88c91df7bf9db2","title":"why do dubai princesses keep trying run away podcast","story":"Ola Salem discusses the orce case of Princess Haya, who fled to London.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA Wire The Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said her party will oppose any Stormont veto as part of a new Northern Ireland-only backstop.Speaking at the party’s think-in today, Ms McDonald said that the DUP “must not have a veto on protecting Ireland’s basic rights”.The idea of a role for Stormont in a new Northern Ireland-only backstop – to replace the existing all-UK backstop, which commits the country to remaining under EU rules in the absence of a better solution – has been mooted in recent days in London.However, Ms McDonald said: “There should be no veto in the protection of Irish interests ... The DUP, the assembly, nobody can have a veto on what are very, very necessary bottom-line protections. They’re not green protections, or orange, it’s not a nationalist or a unionist demand, this is the position of Ireland, this is the position that has been articulated consistently since Brexit came to pass and this is the position that now must be adhered to .”Speaking to journalists at the Carrickdale Hotel on the Louth-Down border, Ms McDonald said that there must be “no hardening of the Border, that means no customs, no checks, no matter where they are”.Asked if she would consider voting pacts among the anti-Brexit parties in the North in the coming British election, the Sinn Féin leader said: “There is room for thoughtful and intelligent joint working together ... what form that takes , I think we need to reflect on.”‘Go-to-Westminster platform’However, in her speech to delegates this morning, Ms McDonald ruled out any change to Sinn Féin’s abstentionist policy, promising the party would stand candidates in the next British general election who would not take their seats at Westminster.In her speech to delegates, Ms McDonald described the British government policy as a “Brexit fantasy that is profoundly stupid and immeasurably dangerous”.“Mr Johnson’s stupid, dangerous fantasy cannot become Ireland’s nightmare because Brexit is a very English problem and the consequences of it cannot be shifted on to Ireland,” she saidLater, winding up the one-day conference, the Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said that the party would oppose any checks near the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as outlined by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar last week, in order to protect Ireland’s place in the single market.She disputed the unionist view that a Northern Ireland-only backstop would be a constitutional issue but said that the planning for a united Ireland must begin “without delay”.“The only certainty,” she said, “is that Irish unity is the only solution.”She said that Sinn Féin would hold the Taoiseach to his word “whenever he said that no citizen in the North would ever be left behind again”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Her claims of harassment were dismissed.The size of award Miss Macken will receive has yet to be determined.Miss Macken, who was previously a vice president at Deutsche Bank, was hired by BNP in Paribas in 2013.She was paid £120,000 a year, but unbeknown to her, a male recruit hired with the same job title and responsibilities was being paid £160,000.In her first four years her male peer was paid more than £167,000 in bonuses compared to the £33,000 she received, the tribunal heard.Early on in her employment males colleagues allegedly left a witch’s hat on Miss Macken\u0027s desk, leaving her visibly upset.The PA of one of her former bosses, Matthew Pinnock, said a group of male colleagues had pulled the prank after an afternoon drinking session in the pub.Georgina Chapman told the tribunal: In October 2013, a large Halloween-style black witch\u0027s hat was left on Stacey Macken\u0027s desk after some of the Prime Brokerage team, including Matthew Pinnock, had gone drinking at the pub towards the end of the day.”When Miss Macken arrived for work the next day she was “visibly upset” and confided in Miss Chapman that she felt “really uncomfortable” working with the male colleagues in question.After repeated internal complaints about her treatment, which she claimed caused her further unfair treatment, Miss Macken finally took the bank to a tribunal in April this year, claiming more than £4 million in compensation and back pay.BNP Paribas previously claimed they had hired her as a \u0027junior\u0027 and that her male colleague deserved his higher salary because he was her senior.The bank declined to comment on the judgment of tribunal.But the judgement ruled said Miss Macken, of Fulham, west London, had been the victim of unfair treatment because she was a woman.Leaving a witch\u0027s hat on a female employees desk, in a predominantly male working environment, was an inherently sexist act that potentially reflects on the nature of (the) working environment for the Claimant and the approach that was taken to women, the judgement reads.The tribunal also condemned Mr Pihan\u0027s repeated use of the phrase not now, Stacey when talking to her.This was a demeaning comment that was made so regularly that it was a source of comment by the Claimant\u0027s colleagues.City of LondonBanks and FinanceBrexit latest news: Downing Street criticised for calling into question impartiality of Scottish judgesComment: What a sorry state we\u0026#39re in when Fireman Sam is too male, pale and stale for the woke brigadeComment: The Supreme Court would be wise to accept that prorogation is too political for judgesComment: I thought Labour’s approach to Brexit couldn’t get any sillier.

We do a salsa and a waltz. The celebrities do, like, four steps and then we sort of move on.”A fellow dancer, Dianne Buswell, said she referred to the process as “speed dating”.As the celebrities dance with each professional in turn, producers walk around the room observing which pairings have the greatest chemistry.The celebrities and professionals at this year\u0026#39s Strictly launch showFootage of this year’s session will be included in a BBC One special, Strictly The Professionals, to be broadcast this Saturday.It features interviews with former contestants. Jake Wood, the EastEnders actor, said the event was unnerving: “The producers all walk around and you’re not sure what they’re looking at,” he said.Mollie King, the singer and 2017 semi-finalist, joked that “all of us female contestants danced with all of the pro boys and it was one of the best moments of my life, just being swung from man to man”.Brian Conley, the comedian, said the professional dancers were more interested in where the celebrities were based than their dancing ability.He recalled: “Everyone will come up to you and say, ‘Hello, where do you live?’ I thought, why does everyone want to know where I live? And it’s because they know they’ve got to rehearse with you and they don’t want to be too far away from London.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Scientists have suggested possibilities including a star falling into a black hole or artificial bursts being sent through the universe from alien life.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

But it was one of those repeating bursts – which offer the best chance of understanding more about the origin – that scientists picked up sending huge numbers of blasts through the FAST telescope.Researchers have been monitoring the source since since 2012, when it was first found and christened\u0026nbspFRB121102. But now that the 500-meter FAST telescope has been switched on, scientists have been able to see even more of them.Nasa reveals spectacular photo of avalanche on MarsThe science team working on the telescope are now picking through the data, collected at the end of August and beginning of September, to understand where it might be coming from.As well as allowing for the further study of existing sources, scientists hope to use the technology on the FAST telescope to find yet more FRBs, Chinese state media reported.As well as looking for more FRBs, the telescope will be used to look for other hints to the nature of the universe, now that it is fully functioning. That will include searching for sources of hydrogen, which could shed light on how the universe came to exist.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The employees’ paid holiday allowance was already used up in April during a month-long shutdown of the factory, planned before the original Brexit date of 31 March.Although BMW’s current plan is to close the plant for no more than a fortnight, the shutdown could be extended to “three weeks or more” if the carmaker has trouble importing vital components, he noted.Speaking at the Frankfurt Motor Show earlier on Tuesday, Mr Peter told reporters that BMW will halt production at the Oxford plant on 31 October and 1 November regardless of whether Britain leaves the EU with or without an agreement.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The peloton rides past the Angel of the North during stage four of the Tour of Britain from Gateshead to Kendal.Australia celebrate the wicket of England\u0027s Craig Overton, which meant they won the fourth test and retained the Ashes.Manchester City celebrate after Caroline Weir scored during their Women\u0027s Super League match against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium.

You can at least partly blame the business of moviemaking for that.\u0026nbspThe first outing for Pennywise, the world’s favourite frightening clown, was produced for just $35m (£28.4m) and went on to gross in excess of $700m, making it one of the most profitable films of 2017.\u0026nbspAs a result, Chapter Two didn’t just get the go ahead. It got a much bigger budget, double the original according to director Andy Muschietti, with plenty more where that came from for marketing and promotion. \u0026nbspWith all that extra money he made...\u0026nbspnot a stinker but a collection of great inidual scenes without a coherent narrative behind them. An ok film that\u0026nbspis arguably\u0026nbspless than the sum of its parts. That is\u0026nbspat least, one of the charges that has been laid at the door of the sequel.\u0026nbspA lack of cash, or at least a limit on it, clearly puts storytelling\u0026nbspon a premium. Oodles of it often leads to filmmakers becoming focused upon spending it at the cost of a good tale.\u0026nbspBut if the end product proves popular, who cares? A franchise can be built\u0026nbspupon its shoulders. Which is why studios like Warner Bros are willing to commit big piles of bucks to follow up a hit.Created with Sketch.

Each outing is a stab in the dark.\u0026nbspThat risk is much reduced if the film is part of an established franchise which can get people into theatres regardless of what critics say. Just ask Disney shareholders. It took a risk on establishing the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has gone on to prove that there really is such a thing as a golden goose.\u0026nbspThe name “Marvel Studios” on a film all but guarantees an opening.\u0026nbspHang on a minute, though, I hear you say.\u0026nbspIsn’t there a problem with It: Chapter Two here? Haven’t Warner’s executives allowed Muschietti to shoot them in the foot?\u0026nbspThe film, after all, does something rare, particularly with the horror genre, which could be said to have set the franchise ball rolling given that there were a plethora of them around before the MCU was even a twinkle\u0026nbspin Kevin Feige’s eye.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A definitive one.\u0026nbspThere thus wouldn’t appear to be any scope for a third outing, much less an extended franchise.It: Chapter Two review: An admirable but unwieldy conclusion It Chapter 2 director explains why sequel opens with hate crimeClown-only screenings of It Chapter 2 announced by US cinema chainOh ye\u0026nbspof little faith. For a start, those who slogged through the 1,400 or so pages of the source novel and paid attention to the role played by Ben Anscombe in the final act will be aware that there’s the potential for a literary sequel should Stephen King be so minded. What if Ben, shall we say, missed something, in the tunnels beneath Derry, the fictional New England town where the story is set?\u0026nbspThe film plays out differently. But a bit of exposition here, a flashback there… it’s not as if it hasn’t been done before.\u0026nbspMuch more likely, given what’s been said about the future of the franchise, is a prequel and perhaps a multiple of prequels given the years of history Pennywise has in Derry’s violent streets.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIt will ultimately depend on the returns. It: Chapter Two\u0026nbspmade $91m in North America plus $94m internationally over its opening weekend. That is quite a bit less than the first outing.\u0026nbspBut that makes it a disappointment only by comparison to its predecessor. For an R- or 15-rating movie it’s still one of the best openings of all time. Factor in that it did this despite a\u0026nbsp169-minute running time, and the lukewarm critical response, and the financial side of the endeavour looks very promising.\u0026nbspForbes put the overunder for the total at $450m, which is, again, more than respectable for a horror film with\u0026nbspa certificate that restricts its audience.\u0026nbspAnything north of that would make the return of Pennywise in some form or another a financial imperative. And thus a virtual certainty.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Ashley has something Johnson lacks: a comfortable majority. He holds more than 60 per cent of the shares.\u0026nbspSports Direct: Why failure to find an auditor might be for the bestSports Direct rescues Jack Wills in £12.75m dealBut the vote still mattered. It gave the company’s independent shareholders a means by which they could offer up a verdict on the quixotic way Ashley has been running the company.This year we’ve had delayed results. The company is currently without an auditor and the big four accountants are showing a marked reluctance to tender for the work.\u0026nbspIt’s been gobbling up the high street with wild abandon, but this has led to some serous problems, notably in the case of House of Fraser, the acquisition of which kicked the company in the financial guts. The Belgians, meanwhile, say they’re owed more than £600m in taxes.\u0026nbsp The media was barred from the meeting.Voting advisors have recommended shareholders oppose his reappointment citing multiple governance issues. The shares have been dogs.I could go on.\u0026nbspAnd yet despite all this a thumping majority of independent investors effectively said, you carry on Mike. We’re ok with this.\u0026nbspIt’s like rebel Tory Dominic Grieve saying to Johnson something like, you know what, forget all that stuff I made a fuss about. You’ve got my vote from here on out regardless of what you do.\u0026nbspThe investment community’s defenders would point to victories they have secured in the past. The much criticised former Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell ultimately resigned despite enjoying the support of Ashley.

Especially if their own education was vastly different to some of the more challenging schools. \u0026nbspIs a younger workforce a bad thing? It is true that they will have less experience but they are also likely to have more energy to work the long hours associated with the job. They may also be more up-to-date in the latest teaching styles, government reforms and technology. \u0026nbspHowever, a better balance of youth and experience can only be a good thing in schools. The government has announced plans to finally improve teachers’ salaries but it will take a lot more to stop older, more experienced teachers from leaving the profession in droves.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It includes a whole host of new features, but Apple mostly spoke about the camera and the colours.Read more about the iPhone 11.Just like its cheaper sibling, the iPhone 11 Pro was introduced with a lot of talk about its camera and its new finishes. But Apple also offered some more explanation of its unprecedented new phone.It is the first time Apple has used the pro name in an iPhone. And marketing boss Phil Schiller said it lived up to the name, with a variety of changes that would make it suitable for real professionals. (But, again, they were mostly about colours and cameras.)Read more about the iPhone 11 Pro.Apple has been making a big push into services, and they received a huge and detailed introduction at the start.The company showed off some more details about Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, which allow people to stream television and games respectively.It also finally revealed how much they\u0027ll cost, and when they\u0027ll come out.Read more about Apple\u0027s new online services.The Apple Watch can finally tell the time, all the time. The biggest update with the new Apple Watch is that the screen is always on.There were some other features, too, such as a compass and some new materials. But the biggest by far is that the awkward wrist-flick that was required to use previous models is now gone.Read more about the Apple Watch Series 5.This\u0026nbspwasn\u0027t\u0026nbspannounced during the event, but was conspicuous in its absence.

Just as with the cheaper model, the company focused primarily on the camera in its announcement.The company said that its improved screen as well as new colours justify the pro moniker, which has only ever been used on bigger devices.This is the first phone that we\u0027ve called pro, said Apple\u0027s Phil Schiller, as he unveiled the phone.For us that means it\u0027s the first device that pros can count on to get work done. But it\u0027s also a device for all of us who want the best product made, even if we\u0027re not a pro.The iPhone 11 Pro costs $999 or $1,099 for the bigger Max version, the same price as the XS and XS Max they replace. Pre-orders will begin on Friday – at the slightly later hour of 5am pacific daylight time – and will all start shipping on 20 September.The new phone comes in a number of colours, including a brand new green. And those finish are also matte, rather than the shiny gloss in previous versions.It also includes three different lenses in the camera. As well as the normal one, and the zoom that arrived in recent iPhones, it also has an ultra-wide camera that can allow for images that take in twice as much as the previous phone.New Apple Watch finally brings screen that will never turn offThe iPhone can take photos with all of those different cameras at once, Apple said, letting people choose either to zoom in or to use the new wider lens to take in the full detail. The three cameras are able to talk to each other, so that they are aligned ready for switching between the different lenses.It also includes a feature called Deep Fusion which can use machine learning to take a variety of different photos at once and combine them into the best version of any photo. It is computational photography mad science, said Mr Schiller, it is way cool.It also includes new video recording features, as well as updated editing tools to allow them to be adjusted after the fact. The phone has the ability to record through two of the cameras at once, and switch between the two even as video is being recorded.Inside the phone is Apple\u0027s brand new A13 Bionic chip. The company said that will be vastly quicker than all of the chips it has made before, but that it can also work less hard to preserve battery life.The iPhone 11 Pro can last four hours longer than the iPhone XS that it replaces the bigger Max version can last five hours longer than the XS Max, Apple said. It will also come with a new more powerful charger to allow it power up more quickly.Apple said there was also a variety of new features it did not have time to discuss, including upgraded material\u0026nbspthat gives it the strongest glass in a smartphone.Follow the latest from the iPhone event below:Even with hours left to go until the event, last-minute rumours are revealing what the new iPhone 11 might look like. Or, specifically, what it won\u0027t look like: according to numerous reports, the long-rumoured feature that would allow the back of the iPhone to work like a charger is not actually going to arrive with this phone.\u0026nbspThe feature appeared to make sense: competitors like Samsung already have it, and it could be a useful way to charge up devices like AirPods or even other people\u0027s iPhones.\u0026nbspBut according to reporters including the usually reliable Mark Gurman, that\u0027s not coming. And the reason why could be a little worrying and embarrassing for Apple:\u0026nbspHave heard as well Apple has been having some issues with the reverse wireless charging for AirPodsWatch on back of the new high-end iPhones, despite it being planned, he wrote on Twitter.\u0026nbspThis is a feature Samsung has had for months and would be Apple’s second miss on charging (AirPower) if true.Here\u0027s everything you need to know ahead of today\u0027s event.\u0026nbsp(This is worth taking with a pinch of salt, however: names of devices, like prices, are known only by a very limited number of people with Apple and so leak less often. They\u0027re also not usually actually written on the boxes or anything, which means that they can be changed at the very last moment.)One of the things we\u0027ll get to hear today is the release date for iOS 13. It brings a whole set of features – probably most obvious among them is the dark mode – but it also makes some smaller changes, too.\u0026nbspOne of them is the way that it tries to protect your privacy. On the new operating system, the phone tries to alert you if an app is tracking your location, and asks you whether you really want to share that data with the app. (Android 10 also has a similar feature.)\u0026nbspThat\u0027s probably going to be difficult for apps like Facebook, which have been criticised for the wealth of data they gather on things like location. Which is why the company has published a blog post ahead of the release, explaining why it does that.\u0026nbspFacebook is better with location, the post, written by engineering director\u0026nbspPaul McDonald, reads.\u0026nbspIt powers features like check-ins and makes planning events easier. It helps improve ads and keep you and the Facebook community safe. Features like Find Wi-Fi and Nearby Friends use precise location even when you’re not using the app to make sure that alerts and tools are accurate and personalized for you.Apple is not expected to include 5G support for the iPhone 11, meaning it will fall a step behind rivals like Samsung.\u0026nbspThis may not matter for markets like the US and the UK, where 5G coverage is very limited, but it could have an impact on certain Asian markets.\u0026nbspPeter Jarich, head of mobile data firm GSMA Intelligence has been in touch to share his views on this:\u0026nbspApple can’t rest on its laurels its business success depends on it.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA lack of 5G support in the new iPhone won’t surprise anyone, though it will still disappoint operators looking for 5G devices to help them drive traffic to new 5G networks. At the same time, new features that are expected – improved camera functionality, improved processor, upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 – may all seem incremental rather than revolutionary, particularly if the product line and form factor line-ups remain relatively constant. In reality, form factor (and pricing) ersity, combined with a compelling case for customers to upgrade, is an important strategy for keeping the iPhone relevant for a broad set of smartphone users, while keeping sales robust. And as services continue to grow as a revenue source for Apple, it’s increasingly important for Apple to get iPhones into the hands of consumers.\u0026nbspIf you want to reminisce on where it all began, you can watch Steve Jobs introduce the original iPhone in full below.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything...If you\u0027re wondering about the prices for the iPhone 11 range, the latest leak from SlashLeaks has you covered:\u0026nbspiPhone 11 - $749iPhone 11 Pro - $999iPhone 11 Pro Max - $1,099\u0026nbspThis is the same pricing as last year for Apple\u0027s new iPhones.\u0026nbspApple is also expected to slash the prices of last year\u0027s iPhone X and iPhone XS.For the first time ever, Apple has made it possible to watch an\u0026nbspiPhone unveiling on YouTube.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYou\u0027ll be able to watch it here:\u0026nbsphttps:www.youtubewatch?v996wliAI_y4\u0026nbspIt wasn\u0027t so long ago that viewers needed some form of Apple hardware or software just to watch the event.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 460 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.560 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1360 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1460 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1760 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2160 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2760 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2960 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3160 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3660 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4360 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4560 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5960 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6060 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 460 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.560 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1360 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1460 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies.

It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled.

Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4360 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4560 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5960 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6060 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.Earlier this month, a clip from HBO’s\u0026nbspThe Shop\u0026nbspshowed Lil Nas X being asked why he had decided to come out as gay in June 2019, at the height of his success.“He said he was gay, so what?” Kevin Hart (who is currently recovering from injuries sustained in a car crash)\u0026nbspinterjects.Lil Nas X then begins explaining: “It’s not being forced, it’s just knowing that growing up, I’m growing up to hate this s***. I’m not supposed to–”“Come on now,” the rapper says. “If you’re really from the hood, you know.”Lil Nas X goes on to explain that coming out while being “at the top”\u0026nbspprofessionally (which he has been thanks to the success of his hit “Old Town Road”), then “you know it’s for real”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Eighteen years on, the New Yorker recalls the horror of\u0026nbsp911 and its aftermath, and how it has informed his writing…Click to followThe IndependentOn 10 September 2001, I went to bed with a stuffy head, and took a decongestant. So on the 11th I awoke late, groggy. My wife had already left for work. Our dog kept me company while I shaved and showered, dressed and caffeinated. I was aiming to leave for the office by a quarter to nine.I was one minute late.So it was 8.46am when I bent to say goodbye to Charlie Brown, and off to the side some fast movement caught my eye, with a whirr-whoosh that sounded like a cartoon version of an incoming missile, some disaster about to befall Wile E\u0026nbspCoyote. I spun my head to the window where the noise had shot by, but I saw nothing. I stood up. I turned to the south. That’s when I saw.This was not a great apartment. But one corner of the loft was lined with huge windows that faced the Hudson River to the west, and the World Trade Centre\u0026nbspjust a couple of blocks to the south. The view was breathtaking, the immensity of the towers filling your field of vision. Sometimes I’d just sit and stare at the towers, awestruck.Now, at 8.47 on a Tuesday morning, I was staring at a hole in one of the buildings.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.I immediately called my wife, told her, “I think the World Trade Centre just got hit by a missile.” I turned on the television, which was at first reporting nothing definitive, but the situation was definitely alarming. I was still staring out the window, listening to nothing on the TV, when the second plane hit. The fireball briefly looked like it was never going to stop expanding, it would engulf me. I flinched away, nearly toppled over my chair.Now we knew that New York was being attacked. But was that attack finished? Or were these planes just the first two salvos of a massive bombardment, an invasion of the country, the end of the world as we know it?On 911, people remember their favourite story about Steve BuscemiI definitely didn’t want to go outside. Our home was surrounded by high-value targets – City Hall, Wall Street, both the New York and the American Stock Exchanges, the Federal Building, every level of government and finance, the main switching station for transatlantic and East Coast telephone calls, big bridges and long tunnels, all this crucial infrastructure was right out the door. Back in college in the 1980s, I’d taken a poli-sci class called War and Peace in the Nuclear Age, and one of our assignments was to determine the single spot in the entire world that could do the most damage – human fatalities, economic disruption, political upheaval – with a modest-sized nuclear device. Everyone in the class came up with the same answer: that spot was right here. It was demonstrable it was math.What was I going to do? I definitely wasn’t going to the office. But should I be behaving as if the city was\u0026nbspbeing invaded? What would that behaviour look like?I started to notice pieces of building falling off a tower, one bit after another, from the very top. This didn’t make sense, I didn’t see any damage up there. So I looked more carefully. Those were not bits of building. Those were people. They were jumping off the roof, a thousand feet in the sky.When the south tower began to collapse, for the briefest second it wasn’t obvious to me what was happening, then I understood, but it still wasn’t thoroughly clear how exactly the building was going to fall, or how much of it, or in what direction, and if that tower fell over like a lumberjacked tree, and tipped my way, it would land on me.When the debris cloud hit, the building shivered, and I heard a small crash, like someone had dropped a wineglass at a partyThe immense cloud of dust and debris came hurtling towards me, a terrifying mass containing... what? Girders, I-beams, mammoth chunks of concrete, who the hell knew, maybe the entire collapsing building was in that cloud – was that cloud – headed my way at a hundred miles an hour, two hundred, who could tell? So I picked up Charlie Brown and fled from whatever was going to come crashing through the window, through the walls, through the roof. I shut us in the dark of the windowless bathroom.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Right now.When the debris cloud hit, the building shivered, and I heard a small crash, like someone had dropped a wineglass at a party. Was this the last noise I’d ever hear? I waited, my hands shaking as I stroked the dog, my heart racing...After a few seconds of nothing, I opened the door.I hadn’t turned on any lights that morning, because it was a spectacularly beautiful day, as usual for that time of year I have since come to think of it as 11 September weather. But now the rooms were almost completely dark in the blackout of that cloud. I couldn’t see anything out the windows, just thick dark greyness pushing up against the glass, like Stephen King’s fog. I turned on lights. The sound of shattering glass? That was a picture that had been shaken off the wall.I couldn’t even see the building across the street, 40ft away. But the cloud slowly dispersed until finally I could dimly make out the World Trade Centre site, where there was now only one Twin Tower. Was there really nothing left?The cop was there to enter every home before the residents, to look around quickly for anything horrifying that might have come hurtling through a window. I heard that people had found body partsJust a few minutes later, the other building came down.\u0026nbsp How did I not see that coming?I eventually went downstairs, outside, to reconnaissance. It was slow-motion chaos out there, shell-shocked people staggering through the mess, papers fluttering in the sky, everything under a thick coat of ash, like fresh snow. The only thing that seemed to be happening quickly were the sirens, they were wailing from every direction, fast-moving vehicles somewhere I couldn’t see. I found a policeman, who told me I should prepare to leave, the electricity was going to be turned off, the gas, the water too, all for safety. My building was going to be evacuated. The whole neighbourhood.So in the middle of the afternoon, I left home carrying a single change of clothing, and basic toiletries, and a couple of meals for Charlie Brown. My dog and I trudged through the ash across City Hall Park, up and over the Brooklyn Bridge, from which I couldn’t stop turning back to look over my shoulders, where there were no Twin Towers left at all.It didn’t occur to me that I wouldn’t step back into our home for two weeks, and even then it was only a brief visit on a grim Sunday, accompanied by a police escort who was there to make sure we didn’t stay, or stick around too long. Also the cop was there to enter every home before the residents, to look around quickly for anything horrifying that might have come hurtling through a window. I heard that people had found body parts.My wife and dog and I were living with relatives uptown, in a spare bedroom. Indefinitely.We were finally allowed to move home in mid-October. Our neighbourhood had become the Frozen Zone, ning a few blocks in every direction from Ground Zero, penned in by thousands of feet of newly erected chain link patrolled by National Guardsmen in battle fatigues and helmets carrying assault rifles, militarised checkpoints, we had to present ID to prove our residency, our identity. The local school had been repurposed as a staging area for a rescue effort that never rescued a single person then for the recovery, the cleanup.The thing that’s impossible to understand if you weren’t there was the smell. Those massive piles of rubble – what was left of two tremendous buildings, each more than a quarter-mile tall – those piles were on fire for one hundred days, acrid clouds of smoke that weren’t fully extinguished until mid-December. The stench was sickening. The sounds of the earth-movers constant. The stadium lights glared all through the night, every night. The armoured vehicles and uniformed men, weapons everywhere: a warzone.But by 13 September\u0026nbspI’d returned to work. I was 33 years old, married but childless, a moment in life when nothing seems as important as career. So of course I went back to work. But my publishing house’s office building was threatened with bomb scares every few days, we needed to evacuate and wander around Midtown, anxiously awaiting the all-clear. Eventually we stopped believing, we stopped leaving, even while anthrax attacks were invading other media offices in the neighbourhood, killing other people who walked these very same streets, people who could have been me. Everyone jumped every time a truck rumbled by. I never slept through the night, and repeatedly injured myself in the kitchen, knife cuts, burns. At the time, I didn’t recognise\u0026nbspPTSD. I just knew my hands and arms were covered in wounds.This is a terrifying way to live. That’s the point, isn’t it? That’s what terrorism is, that’s what it accomplishesWhat was coming next? We were all convinced it was something.In New York, especially down in the Frozen Zone, 11 September\u0026nbsplasted a very long time. The terror seemed permanent. It wasn’t.Fifteen years later, I rarely thought about terrorism anymore it became something that happened somewhere else. But then I went to one of those somewhere elses: Paris, still reeling from its own series of brutal terror attacks, a city with soldiers everywhere, bomb-sniffing dogs, everything suffused with tension, fear. This felt so familiar, this felt exactly like New York after 911, this new category of historical moment: a global metropolis sieged by terror.Not only did this remind me of 2001, it also reminded me of something that had become a constant part of my recent life: suspense novels, which I’d started writing in 2009. The beautiful foreign setting. The definite sense that something bad was going to happen, but the fundamental uncertainty about what exactly that bad thing would be, to whom, and why, and when. Is it now? What should I do? Should I be acting as if this is a life-and-death situation?Trump’s bizarre quotes about 911 before becoming presidentSeptember 11 memorial’s architect looks back, and ahead911 anniversary: Handwritten notes reveal how George W Bush reacted This all defined my experience of 911 and its aftermath, the uncertainty and confusion and mistaken assumptions – was that a missile, is the fireball going to engulf me, will the building fall on me, are there really bombs in the office, or anthrax, was that sound an explosion or a car backfiring, why the hell am I bleeding all the time?This is a terrifying way to live. That’s the point, isn’t it? That’s what terrorism is, that’s what it accomplishes.This is also what a certain type of suspense novel can do.Ever since 911, it had dwelt in the back of my mind that I’d someday write a novel that revolved around a terrorist event. But I didn’t want to write the expected novel, with the expected villains, the expected heroes I don’t want to write the expected anything.\u0026nbspThat someday was right now. The something that was happening next in Paris wasn’t an explosion, it was something much more mundane: I was going to write that terrorism novel, right now. I took my laptop to a café on the rue de Grenelle, opened a new file, and started work immediately, a story that begins on an autumn Tuesday morning at a quarter to nine, when normal ends.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard’s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero.The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who’d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn\u0027t one of them.Courtesy of BFINicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history.  Richard Kelly’s science-fiction mind-bender, which made a star of Jake Gyllenhaal, was a festival favourite upon its debut in 2004. Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest.1047 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)It wouldn’t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy. It was ironically  thanks to Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood whose career flourished after starring in this Sergio Leone film that many consider to be the genre’s peak.Mathieu Kassovitz’s black-and-white drama – translated in English as Hate – follows three young friends and their struggles living in the suburbs of Paris.The Academy may not be frothing at the mouth to nominate horror films, but do have previous (see: The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lamb), which makes the absence of John Carpenter’s influential Halloween a glaring oversight.1347 Harold and Maude (1971)This offbeat romantic drama was a critical and commercial flop at the time of release, which probably accounts for its lack of Oscar nominations. Today, though, it’s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans.On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested.Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination.While falling short of Christopher Nolan’s best,  modest drama Insomnia – made years before Batman Begins – had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations. Alas, it received none.Bill Forsyth’s beloved comedy-drama follows the mishaps of an American man sent to buy up a Scottish village where the oil company he works for wants to build a refinery. Forsyth won the Bafta for Best Director, but the film received no such love from the Academy.You’d be mistaken for thinking the “M” stands for “masterpiece” in Fritz Lang’s German drama that follows the manhunt for a serial killer - not that the Academy agreed.Robert Bresson’s adaptation of André Devigny’s memoirs charts the French Resistance member’s time as prisoner of the Germans during World War II, and is even more enthralling considering Bresson himself was held captive years before.Kenneth Lonergan would go on to win an Oscar for Manchester but he Sea, but Margaret - his three-hour plus drama featuring a searing performance from Anna Paquin - failed to secure a single nomination.2147 In the Mood for Love (2000)Wong Kar-wai set the benchmark for romance in film with his acclaimed Hong Kong drama following a man and woman (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) who develop feelings for one another after suspecting their respective spouses of having an affair together.2247 The King of Comedy (1982)It may have taken him decades to win an Oscar, but the Academy has rarely balked at nominating Martin Scorsese films – especially for films starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy was an exception.Robert Altman’s superior thriller stars Elliott Gould as Raymond Chandler’s private investigator Philip Marlowe in one of the director’s most entertaining films. The director would go on to be the recipient of the Honorary Award in 2006.He may have hosted several times, but Steve Martin has never been nominated for an Oscar. One film he deserved recognition for was Carl Reiner\u0027s 1983 sci-fi comedy, The Man with Two Brains.2547 A Matter of Life and Death (1946)The Academy Film Archive may have preserved A Matter of Life and Death in 1999, but voters failed to recognise the Powell \u0026amp Pressburger’s fantasy-romance at the time of its release in 1946.It may not be credited as his debut, but Mean Streets is very much the first true Martin Scorsese film. The director would go on to win a belated Oscar for The Departed in 2007, but he’d have to wait until 1975 for his first nomination (Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore).No Lars von Trier film has ever been nominated for Best Picture, though Dancer in the Dark came close (it settled for a Best Original Song nomination). He came close with Melancholia, but ultimately, the drama didn\u0027t getDespite being revered as a Coen brothers favourite, not to mention its notable performances from Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, Miller’s Crossing is one of few Coen brother films not to receive a single Oscar nomination. 2947 Once Upon a Time in America (1984)Though it\u0027s by no means a masterpiece, it’s staggering to think that Sergio Leone’s gangster epic - starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci - didn’t acquire any Oscar nominations (the film\u0027s music was disqualified from consideration after Warner Bros accidentally omitted the composer\u0027s name from the opening credits when trimming the film’s lengthy running time for its American release).Critics assumed Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson would have been a shoo-in for awards recognition - most notably in the Best Actor category, thanks to a quietly fantastic performance from Adam Driver - but no such luck.3147 Paths of Glory (1957)Stanley Kubrick never won Best Director despite being nominated four times. One of his films that didn’t make the Oscars cut in any category was his black-and-white anti-war film, Paths of Glory.3247 Play Misty for Me (1971)Clint Eastwood would go onto become something of an Oscar darling thanks to Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, but his directorial debut was ignored by the Academy.Univeral PicturesCourtesy of Getty ImagesReservoir Dogs may not touch Quentin Tarantino’s best, but it remains a surprise that the filmmaker’s debut didn’t get recognised in the screenplay category, at least.Of all the 2018 films to be snubbed at this year’s Oscars, Chloé Zhao’s drama - which stars a real-life rodeo cowboy and his family - smacks as the most unfair.The role of Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards might be considered John Wayne’s best role, but the Academy didn’t agree: he would win his sole Oscar for True Grit in 1970.Another Kubrick film that was completely ignored by the Academy is the director’s Stephen King adaptation, The Shining. Today, it’s considered one of his finest works as well as being one of the most revered horror films of all time.3747 The Shop Around the Corner (1953)It may have endured as one of the best loved romcoms of all time, but it has zero Oscar nominations to its name.Japanese director Hirokazo Kore-eda\u0027s portrait of a family over roughly 24 hours as they commemorate the death of the eldest son was a glaring oversight by the Academy.Before he became Disney\u0027s go to, Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book and the forthcoming live-action Lion King) wrote this independent film about the lives of single, unemployed actors living in Hollywood, California during the 1990s swing revival.The 2007 ceremony would have been far better had Shane Meadows\u0027 coming-of-drama been in contention for awards.The Academy deemed Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle worthy of nominations, but not David O Russell’s Three Kings, which remains one of his greatest films to this day.Tokyo Story is deemed Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu\u0027s masterpiece and was named Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s best film of all time in 2012.4347 Touch of Evil (1958)Orson Welles\u0027 classic noir wasn\u0027t as well loved at the time of release as it is today.Olivia Colman may be in contention for Best Actress at this year’s ceremony, but the fact she failed to earn a nomination (or Bafta, for that matter) for her role in Paddy Considine’s hard-hitting drama Tyrannosaur is one of the biggest oversights in awards history.Another exceptional achievement in filmmaking from Nicolas Roeg that somehow failed to receive any Oscar nominations.Notch it down to bad timing, but Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here - starring Joaquin Phoenix - is a sensational piece of work worthy of reward.Three years later, David Fincher would go head-to-head with The King Speech\u0027s Tom Hooper for The Social Network. In truth, serial killer drama Zodiac is every bit as good as the Facebook drama.Starring future Oscar-winner Christian Bale,  Mary Harron’s adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel – in which the Vice star plays the psychopathic Patrick Bateman - didn’t receive a single nomination.While the final two chapters of Richard Linklater’s Before… trilogy earned screenplay nominations, the film that introduced the world to future married couple Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) was criminally overlooked.Fritz Lang had a number of films overlooked by the Academy this noir, starring Glenn Ford, Lee Marvin and and Gloria Grahame, was one of them.The Academy’s generosity to the Coen brothers peaked when No Country for Old Men beat There Will Be Blood in one of the ceremony’s closest Best Picture races of all time.

Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest.1047 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)It wouldn’t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy. It was ironically  thanks to Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood whose career flourished after starring in this Sergio Leone film that many consider to be the genre’s peak.Mathieu Kassovitz’s black-and-white drama – translated in English as Hate – follows three young friends and their struggles living in the suburbs of Paris.The Academy may not be frothing at the mouth to nominate horror films, but do have previous (see: The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lamb), which makes the absence of John Carpenter’s influential Halloween a glaring oversight.1347 Harold and Maude (1971)This offbeat romantic drama was a critical and commercial flop at the time of release, which probably accounts for its lack of Oscar nominations. Today, though, it’s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans.On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested.Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination.While falling short of Christopher Nolan’s best,  modest drama Insomnia – made years before Batman Begins – had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations. Alas, it received none.Bill Forsyth’s beloved comedy-drama follows the mishaps of an American man sent to buy up a Scottish village where the oil company he works for wants to build a refinery. Forsyth won the Bafta for Best Director, but the film received no such love from the Academy.You’d be mistaken for thinking the “M” stands for “masterpiece” in Fritz Lang’s German drama that follows the manhunt for a serial killer - not that the Academy agreed.Robert Bresson’s adaptation of André Devigny’s memoirs charts the French Resistance member’s time as prisoner of the Germans during World War II, and is even more enthralling considering Bresson himself was held captive years before.Kenneth Lonergan would go on to win an Oscar for Manchester but he Sea, but Margaret - his three-hour plus drama featuring a searing performance from Anna Paquin - failed to secure a single nomination.2147 In the Mood for Love (2000)Wong Kar-wai set the benchmark for romance in film with his acclaimed Hong Kong drama following a man and woman (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) who develop feelings for one another after suspecting their respective spouses of having an affair together.2247 The King of Comedy (1982)It may have taken him decades to win an Oscar, but the Academy has rarely balked at nominating Martin Scorsese films – especially for films starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy was an exception.Robert Altman’s superior thriller stars Elliott Gould as Raymond Chandler’s private investigator Philip Marlowe in one of the director’s most entertaining films. The director would go on to be the recipient of the Honorary Award in 2006.He may have hosted several times, but Steve Martin has never been nominated for an Oscar. One film he deserved recognition for was Carl Reiner\u0027s 1983 sci-fi comedy, The Man with Two Brains.2547 A Matter of Life and Death (1946)The Academy Film Archive may have preserved A Matter of Life and Death in 1999, but voters failed to recognise the Powell \u0026amp Pressburger’s fantasy-romance at the time of its release in 1946.It may not be credited as his debut, but Mean Streets is very much the first true Martin Scorsese film. The director would go on to win a belated Oscar for The Departed in 2007, but he’d have to wait until 1975 for his first nomination (Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore).No Lars von Trier film has ever been nominated for Best Picture, though Dancer in the Dark came close (it settled for a Best Original Song nomination). He came close with Melancholia, but ultimately, the drama didn\u0027t getDespite being revered as a Coen brothers favourite, not to mention its notable performances from Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, Miller’s Crossing is one of few Coen brother films not to receive a single Oscar nomination. 2947 Once Upon a Time in America (1984)Though it\u0027s by no means a masterpiece, it’s staggering to think that Sergio Leone’s gangster epic - starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci - didn’t acquire any Oscar nominations (the film\u0027s music was disqualified from consideration after Warner Bros accidentally omitted the composer\u0027s name from the opening credits when trimming the film’s lengthy running time for its American release).Critics assumed Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson would have been a shoo-in for awards recognition - most notably in the Best Actor category, thanks to a quietly fantastic performance from Adam Driver - but no such luck.3147 Paths of Glory (1957)Stanley Kubrick never won Best Director despite being nominated four times. One of his films that didn’t make the Oscars cut in any category was his black-and-white anti-war film, Paths of Glory.3247 Play Misty for Me (1971)Clint Eastwood would go onto become something of an Oscar darling thanks to Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, but his directorial debut was ignored by the Academy.Univeral PicturesCourtesy of Getty ImagesReservoir Dogs may not touch Quentin Tarantino’s best, but it remains a surprise that the filmmaker’s debut didn’t get recognised in the screenplay category, at least.Of all the 2018 films to be snubbed at this year’s Oscars, Chloé Zhao’s drama - which stars a real-life rodeo cowboy and his family - smacks as the most unfair.The role of Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards might be considered John Wayne’s best role, but the Academy didn’t agree: he would win his sole Oscar for True Grit in 1970.Another Kubrick film that was completely ignored by the Academy is the director’s Stephen King adaptation, The Shining. Today, it’s considered one of his finest works as well as being one of the most revered horror films of all time.3747 The Shop Around the Corner (1953)It may have endured as one of the best loved romcoms of all time, but it has zero Oscar nominations to its name.Japanese director Hirokazo Kore-eda\u0027s portrait of a family over roughly 24 hours as they commemorate the death of the eldest son was a glaring oversight by the Academy.Before he became Disney\u0027s go to, Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book and the forthcoming live-action Lion King) wrote this independent film about the lives of single, unemployed actors living in Hollywood, California during the 1990s swing revival.The 2007 ceremony would have been far better had Shane Meadows\u0027 coming-of-drama been in contention for awards.The Academy deemed Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle worthy of nominations, but not David O Russell’s Three Kings, which remains one of his greatest films to this day.Tokyo Story is deemed Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu\u0027s masterpiece and was named Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s best film of all time in 2012.4347 Touch of Evil (1958)Orson Welles\u0027 classic noir wasn\u0027t as well loved at the time of release as it is today.Olivia Colman may be in contention for Best Actress at this year’s ceremony, but the fact she failed to earn a nomination (or Bafta, for that matter) for her role in Paddy Considine’s hard-hitting drama Tyrannosaur is one of the biggest oversights in awards history.Another exceptional achievement in filmmaking from Nicolas Roeg that somehow failed to receive any Oscar nominations.Notch it down to bad timing, but Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here - starring Joaquin Phoenix - is a sensational piece of work worthy of reward.Three years later, David Fincher would go head-to-head with The King Speech\u0027s Tom Hooper for The Social Network. In truth, serial killer drama Zodiac is every bit as good as the Facebook drama.Zellweger has received significant Oscar buzz for her “transformative” performance in the film, which tells the story of Garland’s final run of shows prior to her death in 1969 at the age of 47. Garland appeared for five weeks at London’s Talk of the Town nightclub, performing despite a fraying personal life and declining health.If Zellweger receives an Oscar nomination for her work, as speculated, it will be her first major awards-season appearance since she won a Best Supporting Actress\u0026nbspOscar in 2004 for Cold Mountain.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Cattermole added that he “got a pittance” from the profits of the S Club 7 range of Hasbro dolls.\u0026nbspIn the interview, Cattermole also appears to reveal that he was forced into his five-year relationship with band member Hannah Spearritt. He said their romance was written into their TV show\u0026nbspHollywood 7, adding: “and because of that, it sort of happened”.Cattermole, who has been working odd jobs in recent years, will make an appearance on\u0026nbspFirst Dates Hotel on Channel 4 on Thursday 12 September.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other.

Four years later, coroner Frances Kirkham made several recommendations to then-communities secretary Eric Pickles. These included “encouraging” housing providers to retrofit sprinklers in tower blocks and a government review of fire safety guidance.Cladding added to the Grenfell block in a refurbishment overseen by the council was later blamed for spreading the flames so quickly there was no time to get them under control. The intended improvements had in fact turned the tower block into a death trap, the inquiry has heard. Hundreds of buildings in the UK are still clad in similar material, and are likely to remain so for at least another ten years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0026nbspheard 140 witness testimonies and\u0026nbspreceived 500,000 documents relevant to both the first and upcoming second phase.\u0026nbspBut bereaved families and survivors, who were waiting to hear the conclusions of what happened by spring this year, were outraged when it was announced they\u0026nbspwere to be pushed back to October 2019, calling it a “slow and painful justice.” This has caused a delay to the second phase of the inquiry, which will not now begin until January 2021 when it will focus on how Grenfell Tower was allowed to become such a risk to its inhabitants.\u0026nbspGrenfell success in resignation speechCouncillor Mason said the new\u0026nbspNorth Kensington People\u0027s Convention\u0026nbspwould work towards devolving powers to residents in the area and is a “response to RBKC’s failure to listen to the Grenfell Bereaved Families and Survivors and the population of North Kensington”.Removing Grenfell-type materials from towers ‘could take 10 years’Grenfell survivors beam fire safety warnings on to tower blocksHe added the plan to launch the convention was decided after 13 North Kensington Labour councillors voted to boycott RBKC’s new “Grenfell Community Assembly” which the authority set up after scrapping a committee tasked with scrutinising its response to the fire.\u0026nbspCouncillor Mason said the\u0026nbspreplacement scrutiny system\u0026nbsp“is not fit for purpose, won’t properly\u0026nbsphold the council leadership to account,\u0026nbspand will not, as promised, put more power into local people’s hands.”\u0026nbspIn a statement, RBKC council leader Elizabeth Campbell\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsptold The Independent:\u0026nbsp“After months of consultation and discussion, scrutiny of the council is being strengthened.Separate to\u0026nbspour scrutiny committees, the new Grenfell Community Assembly will meet for the first time on 24 September and gives the opportunity for the community to ask questions and get answers they need directly from all the agencies involved in the Grenfell recovery.”Anger as Downing Street lights up in tribute to Grenfell victimsBut Councillor Mason said the Grenfell\u0026nbspand wider North Kensington community did not ask for this change and did not want it. He added the Labour opposition have a “duty to scrutinise council decisions.”The people’s convention, he said, would now “plan how we are going to force RBKC to listen to the voices of Grenfell and North Kensington”.\u0026nbspHe said it would begin by asking residents what kind of devolution and council services they wanted,\u0026nbspand would “challenge government to radically reform fire safety and building regulations, and campaign on soil contamination and social housing issues.The group will have its first meeting at the Maxilla Club in Ladbroke Grove on Wednesday 9 October with speakers including Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad, deputy Labour leader Mohammed Bakhtiar, former Grenfell Recovery Scrutiny Committee chair Marwan Elnaghi, and former chair of the Housing and Property Scrutiny Committee Kasim Ali.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

And I do too. Health, education and safer streets are what people need to get on in le, just as they were for me when I was ­growing up.The teachers who got me to study and work hard the police officers who kept us safe when the street I grew up in became a centre for drug dealers and the NHS that cared for my dad in his final days.As every parent knows, nothing is more important than giving your kids the best start in le.That is why I am providing schools with a cash boost to give every child a superb ­education, with the schools that have been historically underfunded ­getting the most.The NHS is one of this country’s ­shining achievements and all of us rely on the care, dedication and expertise of our amazing doctors and nurses.That is why the promises of more money we have made to the NHS are being delivered and why we are putting more money into social care, to give every older person the dignity and ­security they deserve.And to keep our streets safe, I have announced more money to fund our commitment to recruit , new police officers and create , extra prison places.This is the kind of thing that really matters to our daily lives — and it has all been achieved in just six weeks of this new Government.But there is, of course, one big thing that still hasn’t been done after more than three years: Delivering on the ­people’s instructions to leave the European Union.That is why we set a Brexit deadline of October , deal or no deal. We want to get on with it and focus on other priorities such as our public services. No more distractions, dither and delay.Unfortunately, that is exactly what ­Jeremy Corbyn and his allies voted for in Parliament last week, undermining our country’s negotiations with the EU at the final hurdle.Because of their actions, the only way to sort this out once and for all before the deadline would be to go back to the British people in a General Election.But after spending two years constantly calling for an election, suddenly Corbyn is trying to block that too.The day after tomorrow, in Parliament, he and the Labour Party have one last chance to do the right thing and stop running scared of the public.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was charming, witty and fun to debate with.I think some women around the union or Oxford University Conservative Association were head over heels for him.Even today his is thought of as rather dishy in Tory circles with Made in Cha star turned Politico, Georgia Toffolo, describing him as a sex god.An unsurprisingly precocious child, JRM was interviewed on the today programme about finance when he was just -years-old.The keen capitalist, who already read the Financial Times daily and attended company shareholder meetings, was happy to appear on the programme for a fee in .Young Jacob asked the beeb to fork out £ for the interview and when they failed to cough up sent a letter threatening legal action.He wrote: “Dear Today programme, you are in a debt of £ which was payable as from   .“I have no idea what your excuse is but I will not accept it. If it is not received by    which is nearly two months, I shall increase it to £.“If it is not received within  days I shall take legal advice. I hope it does not come to that for I have no desire to prosecute the BBC.”When asked about the incident by The Sun last year, Jacob, now , described it as an error of his misspent youth.A friend who knows both Jacob and Louise claims that the chick lit author turned politico told them that Rees-Mogg had proposed to her but she said no.The pair were very close friends at Oxford and allegedly Louise seriously considered the proposal before turning them down.She would eventually go on to marry Anthony  LoCicero in  but orce him nine years later before hooking up with her current hubby, US businessman Peter Mensch.Jacob and Louise remain close to this day and are Godparents to one anothers children.A fan of the finer things in le, when Jacob was packed of to Eton as a -year-old he discovered he was unhappy with the bedding provided by the prestigious school.As a result, the future MPs now famous nanny, made frequent visits to the Berkshire public school to make his bed.Young Jacob preferred his own linen to the standard issue sheets doled out at the £,-per-year school.During his Far Eastern adventure in the world of Hong Kong finance, Moggy apparently got cosy with a young lady named Maria Butler.The pair apparently dined out together a few times and it seemed like one of the more serious relationships Jacob had had with a woman.But apparently the budding would be romance, which never became physical, was cut short after devoutly Catholic Jacob discovered Maria had been orced following a brief, ill-fated marriage in her early s. History buff Jacob once changed the last four digits of his phone number to , the year of Charles Is execution, to make it easier to remember.He revealed during an interview at the London Palladium with the Spectator that he opted for the number after moving into a new home.Jacob, who read history at Oxford, said: It’s important to have telephone numbers that people can remember.Soyou say to people ‘-the death of Charles I’ they know exactly what to call.As a great British politician, Mr Rees-Mogg obviously opted for a great British Motor.Jacobs dad, Times editor William Rees-Mogg spied a rather nice  T-Series Bentley first owned by former England cricket captain Gubby Allen.Following his death in , Gubby’s papers went on sale at an auction attended by Jacob’s father, a former Editor of The Times and a collector of rare books.It was there that he saw Gubby’s old car for sale and contacted the -year-old Jacob about a potential purchase.Jacob said: “Neither my father nor I knew anything about cars, but we dutully looked under the bonnet and there was an engine there but beyond that, our technical skills were not very great.I bid for it and got it and then realised that enjoying the car was probably going to cost almost as much as buying it”"},{"url":null,"title":"priti patel vindaloo visas britain curry houses","story":"Priti Patel is unveiling plans to lt immigration restrictions on skilled chefs.It comes amid fears Britain’s favourite takeaway is at risk of extinction as specialist cooks cannot get the clearance to move to the country.Ms Patel last night said: “Before we introduce the new points-based immigration system post-Brexit, we are changing the rules to make it easier for restaurants to get the highly skilled chefs they need.“The UK has one of the best food scenes in the world and these changes will make it even better.”Curry houses are closing at a rate of two a week, research shows.The industry has begged ministers for more help for years, warning a shortage of chefs will see more close their doors.Previously, takeaway restaurants could not recruit specialist chefs from abroad.PM Boris Johnson has promised Brexit Britain would open its doors to the “best and brightest” talent.The Home Secretary will lt restrictions so they can look to India and other countries.The Home Office said the move will be a huge boost to all takeaway eateries, not just curry houses.She has also ruled that any new recruits moving to Britain do not have to meet the £, earning threshold that other workers do.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But talk about vorsprung durch technik. They are quite a distraction.According to my notes, though, Motsi’s also: “Hoping to give them a bit more encouragement. It’s a tough journey and blah blah blah.”So, aside from being hopelessly compromised by the presence of her contestant sister, Oti, it was situation normal at Strictly’s pairing ceremony, which was a bit like the NFL draft for Z-list celebrities. Nothing happened and yet everything happened.An occasion that actually asks quite a lot of the contestants, who have to feign wild enthusiasm for the announcement of their partner, no matter who they get.Levels of sincerity ied on Saturday.Dear old Anton Du Beke looked genuinely delighted to be paired with the dance-trained Emma “Honey” Barton off EastEnders and avoid the Anneka Rice bullet.While BBC pundit Alex Scott resorted to the pat footballer’s response: “I’m over the moon,” to avoid saying anything too specic about how she really felt about Neil Jones, and Giovanni Pernice wasn’t fooling anyone with his fist pumps for landing Michelle Visage .Before we even got to that stage, though, viewers had the almost as tricky task of identying this year’s celebrities, who came with some pretty desperate pleadings.“You may know me from being a CBBC presenter.” No.“You may have seen me on BBC’s Animal Park.” No.“People may have seen me cooking on Saturday morning TV.” Yeah, and they may have seen aliens doing a conga down Falkirk High Street at closing time, Viscountess Emma Weymouth, but I haven’t and I’m supposed to be doing this stuff professionally.It’s the height of arrogance, of course, for the BBC to serve up such an anonymous line-up on its biggest show and, one day, it will bite them on the backside.At the moment, though, a certain level of complacency is probably justied, because I’m pretty sure I said the same thing about Seann Walsh last year, and he turned out to be one of the most talked-about bookings in Strictly history.As unimaginative as these new bookings are, there’s also the tantalising prospect of some serious dancing stfs among that line-up, particularly from the blokes.My expectations are especially high low for Mike Bushell, Chris Ramsey, the ping-pong bloke and rower James Cracknell, who’s “got Luba” , but is already being talked about by the presenters in terms that wouldn’t have flattered Professor Stephen Hawking.“He’s used to sitting down.”All of which, you may have noticed, ignores the real elephant in the room at Saturday’s pairing ceremony, who was teed up perfectly when Mike Bushell laid out his dance credentials.“I like jumping up and down to Faithless.”Well, today’s you’re lucky day, Michael. You’re going to be jumping up and down WITH Faithless.“It’s Katya!”And may that be a lesson you’ll never forget, young lady.Celebs On The Farm, Caprice: “We need to encourage Arg.”Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “Mickey , it’s great to see you in such great shape.”And please send flowers and tributesPiers ever thinks Mickey looks “a bit off colour”.HAVING almost run out of people to offend, patronise and revolt in Los Angeles, it was time for Gemma Collins to choose a fragrance for her new brand of perfume on last week’s final episode of ITVBe’s Diva Forever.Something to reflect her “personality” was the instruction.But with Novichok now on the proscribed list, it looked like being a long old haul as she road- tested a few of the alternatives supplied by her visibly horried US agent.“Nah, car air ­freshener,” said Gemma, pulling a face at the first one.“And this one’s got something that makes me feel sick.”“They don’t know who I am,” she bellowed. “You have to explain who I am. The GC.”Ladies and gentlemen of the US press, meet Godzilla’s Cousin.Fair.THOSE eye-watering meatballs Neil “Razor” Ruddock served up for London Zoo staff last week have already passed into Celebrity MasterChef legend, but probably not out of the systems of anyone who ate them.The size and consistency of hand grenades, they were. And one of the keepers should probably have checked the elephant house, just to seethe bulls were missing anything.They were definitely the culinary highlight of the week though, on a show that always stands or falls on the quality of the bookings.Last week it stood thanks to Razor, Joey Essex and dear old Zandra Rhodes, , who now occupies the same DNA space as a Barry Humphries impression of Su Pollard.A lot of the camera’s attention, of course, was focused on Joey, who was funny here in a way he’s really not on a lot of other shows, probably because so much of his food was “dense”, “thick” and “simple”.The real danger to le and limb, however, was Zandra, who’s deaf as an egg whisk and absolutely lethal with a ft-long kebab skewer in her hands, which may or may not have explained a slight edge to the commentary.“On the red team, Zandra and Oti are preparing the trout for the smoker.”A bit harsh. Plenty of le left in the old girl.Keisha: “John Major.”Ben Shephard: “What relation to you is the daughter of your aunt ”Martin: “Sister.”Lucky Stars, Ben Shephard: “Which cereal grain is the main ingredient in sushi ”Kimberly Wyatt: “Seaweed.”And The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In AD a man is said to have been attacked by what Scottish monster ”Rosie: “Giants.”No. Kenny Burns.DEAR old Auntie actually sounding proud of the fact, “Gemma Collins is now at the BBC”.Anyone who thinks  years of politicians shouting “let me just finish” on Question Time is a cause for celebration.Good Morning Britain’s human anaconda, Piers Morgan, almost dislocating his jaw at the thought of swallowing British Airways’ eight-course tasting menu.Britain’s Got Talent’s Wembley Arena audience voting for the best sob storyinstead of the best act .And Brazilian kne thrower Alfredo Silva announcing he’d split from we Anna, then ruining everything by revealing he’d dropped her from the act as well. Just as things might have got interesting. TREASURE Island’s cash-snaffling bounder Lord I Mountbatten already looking like the most inspired reality show booking of the year.Russell Crowe’s stunning transformation on Sky Atlantic’s brilliant The Loudest Voice. Lost Voice Guy’s drooling emoji getting a genuine belly laugh, rather than the sympathetic iety that normally greets Britain’s Got Talent comedians.And the final episode of Mortimer  Whitehouse: Gone Fishing, where the overwhelming sense of peace, calm and friendship is only enhanced by the knowledge the BBC’s best show ticks none of its precious and idiotic boxes.SHANE Warne: “As a commentator I was told two things. One, don’t tell me what I can see. And three, take me out to the middle.”Matt Murray: “It looked a really bad injury when Bloomfield was stretchered on.”Lewis Hamilton: “At Mercedes you’re in the family for le.

He annoyed people because he was clever, pompous and headstrong.”That description could be given today by many MPs, who have tired of Bercow’s constant attention-seeking and his delight in the sound of his own hammy voice.Just as aggravating has been his bias towards the anti-Conservative opposition. That was reflected yesterday in the Commons at news of his imminent resignation.In a nauseating display, Labour MPs who queued up to heap praise on him before they gave him a standing ovation.The Speaker should be a neutral referee who allows the game to flow freely and fairly.But, throughout his  years in charge of the chamber, Bercow was a whistle-happy, partisan official who acted as an additional player for his favoured side and continually put himself at the centre of the action.To understand Bercow, one incident is particularly illuminating. An early turning point in Bercow’s young le came when the head of his primary school refused to put him forward to grammar school, despite Bercow being so precocious he already read The Times .Instead he had to go to the local comprehensive, where he was bullied.On one occasion he was thrown in a pond as his chief tormentor said triumphantly, “Bercow is in there with the other amphibians.”But the experience fed Bercow’s determination to achieve, which he channelled into politics.To his army of left-wing supporters, he was a great reformer who modernised the practices of the Commons, expanded the role of backbenchers and held the Government rigorously to account.But to his enemies, he was squawking egomaniac who demeaned his office with his behaviour. His explicit cheerleading for left-wing causes and Remain was bad enough.This is a figure who subverted the rules of Parliament to wreck Brexit and undermine the Tory Government through endless procedural manoeuvres, as he has shown again this month.The notorious “B******s to Brexit” sticker on his family car, parked at Parliament, has reflected his attitude.His enthusiasm for the fashionable cause of ersity was highlighted in March  when, at a Westminster ceremony, he bizarrely described Elizabeth II as “a kaleidoscope Queen in a kaleidoscope country in a kaleidoscope Commonwealth.”In another typical move, he barred President Trump from addressing Parliament during his recent state visit, justying his stance on the grounds of Britain’s “opposition to racism and sexism.”Nor has he been helped by his eccentric conduct of his we Sally, who is almost as big an attention-seeker as he is.She worked in public relations and was a Labour campaigner when they married in , but it was his elevation to the Speaker’s chair in  that really gave her the opportunity to bask in the limelight.Having appeared on Celebrity Big Brother – and been the first contestant in her series to be evicted – she went on to take part in an reality show with Paddy Doherty, the CBB winner, bare-knuckle fighter and My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star, with the pair taking it in turns to experience the other’s lestyle.She caused more embarrassment with other incidents, like the infamous stunt in  when she was photographed in the shadow of Big Ben wearing just a strategically placed sheet.After that, Bercow reportedly “read her the riot act.”Yet she caused him further humiliation when it was revealed in March  that she had indulged in a long, passionate affair with the Speaker’s cousin, Alan Bercow.Though she rebuilt her marriage, she admitted that she was “a terrible we and always had been.”Perhaps the darkest episode of all was when used social media to hint that the former Tory Treasurer Lord McAlpine was a paedophile, a baseless smear for which she ended up in court in , was convicted of libel and ordered to pay undisclosed damages. Despite his legal victory, Lord McAlpine died soon afterwards.Before his marriage to Sally, Bercow had few serious relationships.Conceited and awkward with women, he was described in his youth by one female contemporary as a “loudmouthed” and “not attractive young man.”A female journalist who went on a few dates with him recalled that he “was a very odd little man and socially quite gauche. He was restless and found it hard to relax.”His insecurities were fed by his stature and also his unusual background, which gave him the sense of being an outsider.Further friction is generated by Bercow’s manner, which combines self-importance with linguistic showing-off and flashes of rudeness.Part of this stems from small man syndrome.Standing just  feet six inches tall, Bercow tries to make up for his lack of stature by parading his authority.The former Tory Minister Sir Simon Burns memorably described Bercow as “a sanctimonious dwarf.”Several Tories were so exasperated with him that in  that they tried to throw him out of his job.The MP James Durridge, who organised this unsuccessful bid, said that Labour find Bercow “convenient because he is a more effective opposition than their own leader.”But since then Bercow’s pro-Remain antics have stretched Conservative tolerance beyond breaking point.That’s why the party decided to take the unprecedented step of standing a candidate against Bercow in his Buckingham constituency at the next election in defiance of the long-standing tradition that the Speaker is never opposed by any of the main parties.There have been repeated accusations that Bercow has bullied his staff, allegations he denies, just as he disputes the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom “a stupid woman.”Whatever the truth, he has not established a harmonious atmosphere at Westminster or enhanced his reputation.Unlike some of his predecessors like Bernard Weatherill and Betty Boothroyd, he leaves office under a cloud.Bercow was brilliant at tennis, even becoming a junior British champion. As a young player, he was described by a professional as “unbelievably talented and invincible.”To this day Bercow retains his deep enthusiasm for the sport and is a big fan of Roger Federer - particularlyhe can watch him for free.An investigation last year found he had received more than £, in freebies since he became speaker - most of which were tickets to tennis and football matches.Indeed, he was spotted at Wimbledon this year wearing a t-shirt with the Federer logo on it, while he was also caught by a BBC camera saying, “We all love you, Roger, all of us.”Im not sure the same can be said of Bercow.After a decade in the role of Speaker, he leaves behind a tainted legacy.He sees himself as a champion of Parliamentary democracy. But in reality, he has presided over a woefully discredited Commons.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At other times of the year the source region is neither cold nor snow-covered and winds from north-eastern Europe bring a form of tropical continental air.Over the late August Bank Holiday, Britain basked in temperatures of C.And while season change has seen the trees start to drop their leaves, forecasters have warned it could be one of the hottest autumns in a century.Forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Computer forecast models support the three-month period ahead being among the warmest on record.“Indian summer-like settled and sunny weather is forecast to start in a week’s time, lasting a week or more and seeing highs up to C.The deadly Hurricane Dorian was expected to merge with Tropical Storm Gabrielle to batter Britain with mph wind and ins rain.Further gusts and deluges are expected on Thursday and Friday after the winds are sent spinning past the Azores.By the end of the weekend, Northern Ireland and Scotland will see some cloud and rain, with the West of England drenched by the beginning of the week.Rain clouds from the west will spread over much of the country and Monday will be very dferent to todays weather with lots of wind and rain as the Dorian and Gabrielle team up."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may honours list quentin letts","story":"Flagrant pro-European MPs started brawling in Parliament. Theresa May gave lordships and knighthoods to her Brexit-blocking favourites.And Commons Speaker John Bercow allowed Remainers to coat him with unctuous praise after he said he was off to spend more time with his £million pension pot.After the vain and aggressive Bercow announced he will finally quit at the end of October, he allowed MPs to spend the next hour and a half nishing him with a weird mix of treacle and bulls**t.“Ah, Mr Snodgrass, you want to say what a marvellous chap I am  The floor is yours.”And yes, they really did go on for an appalling, toe-curling hour and a half — even while they were moaning about being short of time to discuss Brexit.Long after closing time in most pubs, a group of anti-Brexit MPs engineered a physical tussle around the Speaker’s Chair.They hoped their stunt would symbolise their disapproval of Boris Johnson closing down this madhouse parliament for a few weeks in his “prorogation” gambit, which has been approved by the courts.What a pathetic spectacle ensued. One prize prat, Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, tried to jump into Bercow’s lap, pleading with him not to leave the Chamber.It was like seeing a poodle try to jump on to its mistress’s knees.Russell-Moyle was then yanked out of the way by Bercow’s tailcoated minders, and some baby boxing wrists were flapped — handbags at midnight. Classy, eh Some of the House’s most verbose MPs held up sheets of paper saying, “Silenced”.They bleated, “Shame!” and booed when the twirly ceremonial closure of the House began. Bercow added to the hysteria by screaming abuse at Tory MPs.The country must have looked at these maniacs and thought: “Oh do act your age.” What will the outside world have made of it all You occasionally see TV news footage of punch-ups in foreign parliaments, places like Taiwan and Turkey and Uganda.This time the farcical argy-bargy was happening in our own House of Commons. Vladimir Putin must be laughing so hard his plastic surgery may soon rip.Our allies in places such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand must be slapping their foreheads and thinking: “What on earth has happened to the once-calm, reasonable United Kingdom.Can we really do business with this deranged political elite that is ignoring a national referendum ” Theresa May’s resignation honours list was little better.It has long been the custom — heaven knows why — for departing Prime Ministers to nominate a few friends for honours. That practice must now, surely, please be reviewed.Apart from the knighthoods for cricketers Andrew Strauss and Geoffrey Boycott , Mrs May rewarded a bunch of no-hopers in her political circle.Peerages went to her useless chief of staff Gavin Barwell and to her Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins, the civil servant with whom May bypassed elected Cabinet ministers before the Chequers summit of .Various spin doctors were on May’s list, too. Ditto former deputy PMDavid Lidington and big-bucks Tory donors Ehud Sheleg and David Brownlow.One of the few creditable things about Mrs May used to be that she resisted dishing out honours to her mates. Now she has blown even that part of her reputation.If Mrs May had managed to get us out of the EU, as instructed by the electorate, that might have just about passed the smell test.But these drongos were a catastrophic flop. The May team pursued a “Brexit in name only” and could not even achieve that.Honouring them is like giving an open-topped bus ride through the streets to a football team that has just been relegated. What will voters make of this gongs-for-the-boys culture A harmless bit of fun  Or a remote parliamentary crowd giving twirly titles to a long line of sub-par operatives The worst thing is that few of us are surprised by this stuff. I don’t suppose many of us genuinely believe politicians’ promises any more.How can we, when they said they would “honour the referendum” but now tell Boris Johnson to go to Brussels with a surrender letter This same elite, which so casually bungs honours to its pals, always sneers at the word “populist” as being something almost dirty.Instead, it wants the status quo. But the status quo, as we can see, is this gang of grotesques who are histrionically opposed to Brexit and who are so greedily self-rewarding.Why on earth is Jeremy Corbyn so keen on them  The country is desperate for change from these crooks and limpets. We want to get rid of them. Yet Corbyn’s Labour wants to keep them in power. He has become the establishment’s stooge.If populism is the alternative to Bercow and Co, that sounds pretty good to me. Boris Johnson has already shown himself ready to upset the elite. Let’s have more of that.If it takes some sort of electoral pact with Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, who cares  The elite has chosen to float away from us. We need no longer worry what they think.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Drive. Win., Fry reckons the sporadic offerings about a driver who won a record seven world championships,  grands prix, and commanded a following of millions around the world, are not enough.In it, he writes: Corinna and the family have kept a very tight control on information about his treatment which, I think, is a pity.There are millions of people out there who have a genuine affection for Michael, and thats not just his fans in Germany or fans of Mercedes Benz.Because of what he achieved, people would like to know about his condition they are inquisitive and they genuinely feel for him.I do think that reporting on how he is, regardless of whether it is good or bad news - and possibly it is bad news - is important because people can empathise with him.Fry also writes: From what I understand, Michaels family have been able to give him the best treatment that money can buy in a specially constructed facility at the family home in Switzerland where he is looked after by a dedicated team around the clock.I am sure that techniques and therapies have been developed and tried there over the last few years that may well help others.It would be helpful for his family to share how they have dealt with this challenge because there are lots of people in a similar situation who would probably find it beneficial to have that first-hand experiences.Fry was chief executive for Mercedes during Schumachers largely unsuccessful second spell in Formula One.He was replaced at Mercedes by Toto Wolff in .Schumacher was admitted to a Paris hospital to be treated on Tuesday with cutting-edge stem-cell therapy, according to a French newspaper, Le Parisien.The racing ace was reported as being conscious following treatment from French cardiac surgeon, Professor Philippe Menasche.He was admitted under tight guard on Monday to the Georges Pompidou hospital for transfusions of inflammation-reducing stem cells, and is expected to be discharged today.Those close to Schumacher have always insisted his condition is a private matter.Speaking at a media meeting in March , manager Sabine Kehm hinted at a reason for the secrecy, saying that Schumacher had always yearned for a le away from the cameras.In general the media have never reported on Michael and [we] Corinnas private le, she said.When he was in Switzerland, for example, it was clear he was a private inidual.Once in a long discussion Michael said to me: You dont need to call me for the next year, Im disappearing.I think it was his secret dream to be able to do that some day. Thats why now I still want to protect his wishes in that I dont let anything get out.Last year, close relatives reportedly gave French magazine Paris Match an insight into Schueys current health.One was quoted as saying: When you put him in his wheelchair facing the beautul panorama of the mountains overlooking the lake, Michael sometimes cries.And Schumachers former boss at Ferrari Jean Todt has told how he visits the race ace every month.He told The Times: I love Michael.

It wasnapost that long ago that the brutal cold snap killed almost  people as the UK was plunged into a -C freeze with heavy snow and ice that grounded flights, shut schools and caused havoc for commuters. Researchers from a London university have warned that a freezing vortex of Arctic air could sweep across the country in the next few months. With time to prepare for the worst, Britons have been urged to take a few key precautions to protect their homes from a freeze and save money.    Summer isnapost even over yet, but winter will sneak up on us and people can take these steps to make sure they arenapost caught out when severe weather strikes, according to British Gas engineer Hannah Hughes. Test your boiler Ms Hughes said: After basking in the sun this summer, it looks like we’re going from one weather extreme to the next. Rather than wait until the weather turns cold before finding out something’s not working as it should be, we’re advising customers to prepare in advance. Now is the time to test your boiler and make a few small changes around the home to ensure your heating and hot water systems are ready to withstand the weather that’s coming. The Government suggests Britons get their heating system checked regularly by a qualied professional. Check your home for gaps  Property owners and tenants should also do a thorough check of places where heat can escape or cold air can creep in. This means blocking the cold with draught excluders and sealing joints around windows and doors. Bleed radiators Bleed your radiators to get rid of any pockets of air that are trapped inside. Hot water doesnapost circulate effectivelythere is air inside a radiator. Less heat is emitted and it will take longer to warm up your home, meaning your bills will be more expensive. Move your sofa  Move your sofait is blocking a radiator and preventing heat from circulating through the room. Use thick carpets and rugs to stop heat from being lost. Protect your pipes Water pipes can freezethe weather is cold enough, especially during prolonged cold snaps. Frozen pipes can break and cause a major leak as they thaw. Wrap pipes with insulation.

I can’t believe I went to Turkey on holiday and came home with a dog. “But she didn’t leave my side for the whole holiday so I just couldn’t leave her behind, Lucy, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, said.    We were walking home along the beach and lots of stray dogs followed us up until the hotel, but Jessie followed us all the way to our room. The next morning she appeared on the beach and from then on she wouldn’t leave our side. “She’d walk to restaurants with us and even sit by the pool and wait until we came out. It was when people in the hotel noticed how attached she was and said they’d never seen anything like it before, that we started to think we really had to keep her.”Another guest at Tropicana Beach Hotel suggested Lucy could adopt the dog and pointed them in the direction of a volunteering group on Facebook called Gumbet Stray Animals."},{"url":null,"title":"bride groom married shirts save","story":"NewsBride and groom get married in T-shirts and save £, with chilled out weddingRebecca and Glen Maxwell spent £ on cupcakes and a sheet cake from Morrisons and took their guests to Center Parcs for a carvery dinner costing just £ShareCommentsByKim ReaderChris Kitching:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsRebecca and Glen Maxwell decided that a big, expensive wedding wasnt for them \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Rebecca, , and Glen, , spent just over £, on their big day plus the cost of treating their wedding party to a weekend away at Center Parcs.    Feeling pressured to throw a fancy day, they were initially planning to hold a Christmas wedding at a farm, but decided against it when they realised it would have cost them about £, and put them in debt. One evening while agonising over the plans and budget, Glen told Rebecca we could get married in jeans and t-shirts and Iaposd still love you. They felt that weddings donapost need to cost a fortune to be special so they did away with many traditions and focused on the things that were important to them.    In April, the couple tied the knot at the town hall in Darlington, Co Durham, in front of  of their closest friends and family members. The newlyweds bought similar personalised tops for the wedding and mother and father of the bride, and asked their  guests to wear jeans and t-shirts too. GCSE and A-Level tutor Rebecca, of Blyth, Northumberland, said: When we were planning our wedding, we started doing everything to please other people.    Our guest list was getting out of hand. I had even bought a wedding dress but after having Eleanor I went to try it on again and I ended up crying. It just was not what I wanted at all. I felt like I had lost sight of why I was getting married. It was like I was trying to get married like Pinterest had told me to get married. She added: Me and my husband are still married just like all those people who are in £, debt.  I do really believe that so many people lose sight of the real reasons to get married. It becomes like a big expensive show, a production for everyone  and the real reasons are lost in all that. It should be about how in love you are. I donapost know anyone who gets married just because they think their partner is alright. Rebecca said she and Glen, who works in security, like simple things and shun big holidays and expensive nights out. She added: We just love each otheraposs company. What was special was that we were going to join together and I was going to have the same surname as my little girl.  A big dress or fancy day, that all paled into insignicance. I want to show other brides thatthey donapost have a big budget, it doesnapost matter. They donapost have to spend a fortune or put all that pressure on themselves. As long as you marry the person you love, surrounded by people you love, your day will be special. Not only did a registry office ceremony cost just £ but it was the only venue with an aisle wide enough to allow Rebeccaaposs father, Peter Snowdon, , who is in a wheelchair, to give her away. After the ceremony Rebecca and Glen took their guests to one of their favourite places, Center Parcs Whinfell Forest in the Lake District, for a carvery dinner costing £.  With t-shirts and jeans for the wedding party coming in at £, £ spent on flowers and £ for Rebeccaaposs hair and makeup, the coupleaposs big day cost just £, in total. They had saved about £, for their big day, so they used some of the leftover cash to treat their wedding party to a weekend at Center Parcs. Rebecca said: When we realised how much our big Christmas wedding was going to cost we just sat together and said aposthis is crazyapos. We couldnapost justy spending that kind of money on just one day. Suddenly we were thinking aposhow are we going to afford all of this apos instead of being excited about it.  We love Center Parcs so we looked into the prices. We realised we could get married at the registry office with our closest friends and family and take everyone there for half the price. I wasnapost bothered about seeing Glen in a suit and he wasnapost bothered about seeing me in a dress. We just wanted to claw it back and make it a happy family event. We decided to get together the  most important people in our lives and have a fun and relaxed weekend. I just wanted the people we love there to watch us commit to spending the rest of our lives together. It was lovely. Iaposm so close to my dad and having him walk me down the aisle was so important to me. The wide aisle at the registry office made that possible. It meant the world to both of us.

The other  properties on the Deans South estate in Livingston, West Lothian, have slowly emptied since , leaving the streets and parks deserted. The handful of residents clinging on have refused to sell up to West Lothian Council, insisting that they are not being offered enough cash for their homes.  The -year wrangle began when it was found that the homes were built with aerated concrete known as Siporex, which is considered to be inadequate for heavy loads.    Two empty houses were torn apart to establish whether the concrete had been used, before all  homes were condemned. Council tenants were moved out, leaving most of the estate uninhabited. But some homeowners refused to accept cash for their houses, insisting they either wanted the market rate or a house swap. Nearly two decades later, a handful of people are still living on the derelict scheme. Houseproud couple Joe Baxter, , and we Isabel, , bought their four-bedroom home from the local authority through Right to Buy, and have paid off the mortgage. They raised their three children in the house they keep in immaculate condition - despite being surrounded by overgrown greenery and empty buildings. And although they love the house where they have lived for  years, the couple believe it should never have been condemned in the first place.    They say it was valued at £,  years ago and that the situation is leaving them vastly out of pocket, as they have been offered £,. Joe said: We have had this house for  years - for  years we rented it. We bought it in  through Right to Buy, and paid off the mortgage. The situation is demoralising. We love our house - thereaposs nothing wrong with it. We have got a lovely garden. We donapost feel like moving anymore - we just donapost want to move at all. We were gobsmacked when we were told they would be demolished. We could hardly accept it, and couldnapost believe it. It has just been demoralising over all these years - we have lost all our neighbours. We had great neighbours and a great community. We call it aposBeirutapos - it is like a ghost town.    The couple, who have one great-grandchild and eight grandchildren, have been offered a bungalow on the site of their current home, by developers Springfield Properties. They have welcomed the prospect of a solution, as it will allow them to continue living near relatives, but the deal is dependent on the offer being universally agreed to, which has not yet happened. If some homeowners refuse to agree to a deal with Springfield Properties, the local authority could be forced to see a compulsory purchase order . A previous CPO attempt in  was unsuccessful. Kerry MacIntosh has lived on the estate for  years and shares the Baxtersapos hope that she could be given a new home rather than cash. The mum-of-two, who has a daughter aged ten and a -year-old son, thought she had bought her dream home back in  when the house was sold on the open market. But two years later, she received the news that the homes were set for demolition.  Kerry said: There wasnapost anything wrong with them except a defect with the roofs - they could have put in tiles and proper drainage and double glazing. It is not about money, itaposs about doing the right thing. A fair deal would be current market value, or a house for a house. We want like for like. My kids are isolated, theyaposve got no friends here, theyaposve got no neighbours. For  years, the only solution weaposve been offered is a council solution. Why are we getting less money than the house is worth  They condemned them, so we couldnapost move - weaposve been left in limbo. Weaposve worked hard and itaposs like having the rug being taken away. Thereaposs many days you want to pack up and go.

The video, filmed on London Road just north of the station, shows baseball bats and what appear to be knives, machetes and even swords being used in the ugly fight. A signicant crowd of people can be seen watching the fight which spills from the pavement into the road and causes traffic to be brought to a standstill. It is not yet knownanyone was seriously hurt in the mass brawl, but the footage shows men swinging the metal baseball bats with force and clashing with one another.    The incident happened on September , the Met Police confirmed. Although shaky, the video footage, which was originally posted on social media app Snapchat, appears to show a clash between two men initially, both of whom are carrying baseball bats and swinging them wildly. One of the men appears to retreat before being chased not just by his opponent but the other men gathered around them on the pavement.    The pavement is strewn with what appear to be cardboard boxes used for transporting vegetables.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A sunny and friendly -year-old boy died from a heart condition linked to a decade-long battle with obesity .The youngsteraposs death has led to changes on how child neglect is spotted after professionals never [had] a clear plan of action in place to help the family.The case review highlights how doctors ruled out a heart transplant because of the childaposs weight and deteriorating condition, Greater Manchester Police said.The family, who have not been named, bought takeaway food into hospital for the child weeks before he died. Although all professionals in contact with Child F were aware of their morbid obesity, there was never a clear plan of action and neither an early help responseor an analysis of whether this was a safeguarding concern, the case review reads.  At the age of three, the child - known as F in the serious case review - weighed more than kg and had a BMI in the .th centile. GPs, the school nurse, a nutritionist and weight management service either raised concerns or worked with the teenager. However, professionals werenapost often proactive about liaising with other relevant authorities, the report said. On one occasion, a nutritionist failed to discuss their fears about F and their sibling - who was also overweight at the time - with their school or GP, after the pairaposs mother blamed F for their weight and described them as aposlazyapos and a aposdonutapos. On another, the school nurse in Greater Manchester agreed to follow up concerns about Faposs weight with the GP, but the report suggested this did not happen. The report said that the childaposs mother - with whom F and their siblings lived - had also failed to bring the child to ious health appointments, even though F had raised their own anxieties about their health and weight.  Although F did well academically, there were issues with their school attendance rate, which their mother blamed on health conditions. The school was also concerned that F wasnapost provided with a PE kit by their mother, who again said they couldnapost take part because of health problems and disabilities. This information was not true and although the school provided F with a PE kit, they found it dficult to challenge mother about putting obstacles in the way of F taking part in something they enjoyed and which was beneficial for their wellbeing, the report said. It also added that the school encouraged the mother to allow F to walk to school with their friends. They mapped out a route to school so F could meet friends along the way and avoid reported bullying. Mother was unhappy with schoolaposs interference and undermined their approach by continuing to bring F to school by car, the report said. Mother continued to blame Child F for not losing weight, saying they were lazy and did not like PE, it added. Although F attended an additional diet, exercise and self-confidence programme at the school set up by a PE teacher - and which F asked the school to keep quiet from their mother - the report said that it became clear that F was having over  calories before lunch, including a high-calorie takeaway as a second breakfast.  F - who was described in the report as having a apossunny and friendly dispositionapos - had also told the school nurse they wanted to lose weight but found it hard. In December , the child went to the GP about a scalp problem but F also raised concerns about joint pain and askedit was related to their weight. A second appointment was made to discuss it in detail but F didnapost attend. The GP made no further referral to the paediatrician because of the previous non-attendance. Had F attended it would have been an opportunity to explore in depth with Child F what was really happening in their le and how it could be improved. Child F had gained  kg over the previous nine months, the report said. The situation for Child F was clearly getting more serious and this should have prompted a clear plan of action and a mechanism for assessment of what the nature of the problem was and what could be done to address it, it added. By February , the teen had been admitted to hospital and was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy, a blood clot and a long history of morbid obesity. After a stint back at home, they were readmitted to hospital and transferred to an intensive care unit where their health aposdeteriorated signicantly and there were signicant concerns about themapos. F was assessed as not fit enough for a transplant because of their obesity and deteriorating heart condition and F ed to hospital where it was clear that they were now terminally ill and had a short time to live, the report said.  During Faposs final weeks in hospital before their death in April , concerns were raised again about Faposs mother, who aposbrought in take away food, was aggressive to staff and emotionally abusive to F,apos the report said. After F died, criminal inquiries were started but no action was taken, the report said. The case review, which was released at the end of last year, found: Professionals worked in isolation from each other, information was not always shared, and meetings were not held and no holistic assessment undertaken. The complexity of the situation was not recognised and the longer the lack of serious action continued, the harder it was for professionals to consider or name this as a case of childhood neglect, it added. It set out a series of recommendations for agencies to take on board and help to prevent a similar tragedy happening again. Within it, they pointed to the aposlack of professional clarityapos about when childhood obesity should be considered as a child neglect concern and a lack of knowledge about how agencies should work together. These included updating Manchesteraposs obesity strategy to include the need for psycho-social assessments and a multi-agency approach to tackle the problem, as well as placing greater focus on obesity in the cityaposs neglect strategy.

Pam Aitchison arrived for a fortnight-long holiday - but was horried when she couldn’t make the half-mile walk in the heat. The -year-old from Toxteth, Liverpool, said she was left gasping for breath half way and searching for a taxi to get her there. She said: “It was awful. It wasn’t that the walk was high or too long, I just couldn’t do it – I couldn’t make it however much I tried. “The first time I did it I was so breathless I thought I was going to pass out so, from then on, everyone  carried on walking and I got a taxi!” It was the final straw for Pam who has been overweight since adulthood. She decided to lose weight and has shed seven stones in time to celebrate her new slimline shape for her th birthday in October: “And I plan to stay this way.” Pam says: “I hadn’t realised how unhealthy I was and the effect it was having, even though I had asthma and high blood pressure .“But I knew there and then that it wasn’t good for me and I had to do something – not least because I have an adopted daughter, who is nine, and I want to be able to play with her and keep up with her in the park. I had to lose weight. “Carlee has down’s syndrome and she is a lovely little girl and I owed it to her to be better for her my weight was just bringing me more and more down.” When she joined Slimming World in August , Pam weighed st ½lb and was a size  – now she weighs st ½lb and is a size ! “And I feel incredible.

I didn’t like rice.”  Then,Pam had an evening out, she would drink high-calorie lager and she says: “When I got home I’d phone for a pizza to be delivered or another chippie meal.” She can’t believe what she used to eat when she looks at her daily diet now. “I have Weetabix for breakfast and, although sometimes I’ll have a sandwich on brown bread, I’ll often just have fruit for lunch. “For tea I’ll have a healthy stew or chicken or steak with vegetables.

Brooke Skylar Richardson can be seen with a baby bump in the image, which was taken when she was on Spring Break in . The -year-old was also photographed heavily pregnant at her high school prom, two days before she had the child. Richardson was just  when she secretly gave birth in her bathroom and allegedly buried the tot, named Annabelle, in her backyard.    No one around her knew she was pregnant, and she did not reveal to anyone that her child had died, going on to graduate from high school just two weeks later. She was arrested in July  when she ed to the doctoraposs practice where she learned she was pregnant to ask for birth control. When doctors asked what the outcome of her pregnancy had been, she confessed to burying everything, according to US media reports. Prosecutors at Warren County Court in Ohio, USA, claim she bashed in the babyaposs skull after researching aposhow to get rid of a babyapos. She faces charges of aggravated murder and involuntary manslaughter which could see her jailed for lefound guilty. The cheerleaderaposs lawyer said the baby was pale when she gave birth on her bathroom floor and there was no umbilical cord attached. The baby was not breathing, they claimed, and she panicked and buried her shortly afterwards. It is claimed she thought she had months until her due date, but the baby arrived just  days after she found out she was expecting in April . Prosecutors at the Ohio trial read a text message she sent to her mother - who had no idea she was pregnant.    It said: Iaposm literally speachlesswith how happy am... I am literally so excited now just for dinner to wear something cute yayyyy my belly is back and now Iaposm takin this opportunity to make it amazing. She also visited the gym hours after giving birth and took a selfie in the mirror which showed off her stomach.  In the image, which was presented for the first time at trial, she is seen lting up her t-shirt and standing to the side. The teenager sent it the same day she gave birth, they said. Prosecutors presented it along with an image of her babyaposs bones. Richardson shook when the image was shown to the court. Among those who testied on Wednesday last week, the first day of the trial, was -year-old Trey Johnson who claims he is the babyaposs father. He said he and Richardson had sex twice in August , once without protection, and that is when she likely fell pregnant. He was never told about the baby.    The doctor who she told she was pregnant said he advised her that she did not have to have the babyshe did not want to.   Prosecutors presented Richardson - now  - as a premeditated, image-obsessed cheerleader.    While her family were sleeping, she gave birth quietly and destroyed all evidence of her birth and buried her in the backyard, prosecutors said. Dr William Andrew told the court that during a medical appointment, Richardson had told him: I canapost have a baby. Iaposm going to college in September. Another medic, Dr Casey Boyce, said when she asked her about the pregnancy when she ed to the doctoraposs office in July , she started sobbing and told her: I had it alone in my house and buried it in my backyard. She didnapost want me to tell anyone that I knew. She then consulted with Dr Andrew and called the police. Two crime scene workers said they were drawn to a fire pit in the back yard where the babyaposs remains were thought to have been tossed. But bones found in the fire pit belonged to an animal. Richardsonaposs defence team say the text message to her mum was taken out of context and speaks more about concern with her body image and history of eating disorders rather than the pregnancy.

Now , Dr Chynn could see the burning towers while he was out walking his dog on Manhattan, New York, that morning. He grabbed his roller blades and rushed to the scene. The medic was working at a local hospital during a previous terror attack scare and knew how vital his experience would be at the scene rather than waiting for any victims to be taken to hospital.  When Dr Chynn, who lives in New York City, arrived at the scene he was surrounded by debris and smoke but got to work setting up what he claims to be the first triage centre on site. The doctor has now released the photographs he took during the week he volunteered at the scene to demonstrate the kindness of strangers in such a heartbreaking time. Dr Chynn said: When I saw the plumes of smoke coming from downtown I knew I had to go down and see what was going on.  Having worked in a hospital during a previous terror attack scare, I knew that I would be more use at the scenepeople were injured, so I put on my rollerblades and headed down. As soon as I arrived I was surrounded by smoke, debris and paper inches deep but I had to go and find the buildings. Along the way I met other volunteers and after about  minutes of looking we found the remains of the Twin Towers, which were only about three stories high. The scene was awful, people were trying to clear debris and body parts from all over the place.    I quickly did what I could to help and - as the first physician on the scene - set up the first triage centre. I was on the scene volunteering for about a week and captured these photos whilst I was there. They were captured on a film camera, so took me a while to get them developed, but as soon as I got the physical photos back I knew I had to share them.  As distressing as the time was and the photos are, they show the pure compassion that people have for other strangers. Everyone looks back on what happened in dismay at the human race instead of how a city came together to risk their lives and help people they didnapost even know. Almost , people were killed in   with a further , injured.  The death toll has continued to rise as those who tried to help have fallen victim to  -related cancers and respiratory diseases. New Yorkaposs skyline has never been the same again following the fall of the Twin Towers. But in a show of defiance, a new tower, has been erected and now dominates Manhattanaposs sky.

Healthy bacteria from donors will be put into a tampon-like device and inserted in a health trial involving about  women who suffer from bacterial vaginosis . It is hoped the transplants could finally provide a aposcureapos to women with BV, a common infection which causes an unusual discharge with a strong fishy smell.    Antibiotics can treat BV, which occurs when there is a change in the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina, but it often comes back within three months. Some of the trialaposs volunteers will receive a dose of healthy vaginal microbes from donors to restore the balance. Others will have a placebo instead of a vaginal microbiota transplant . Donors would be screened for HIV and other infections and they must abstain from sex for at least a month before giving a sample. Researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, were inspired by the success of poo transplants.  They say the vaginal fluid transplants could provide a fully curative or restorative BV therapy. BV is not an STI but it can increase the risk of contracting one such as chlamydia and getting urinary infections. The most common symptom of BV is a discharge with a strong fishy smell, particularly after sex, the NHS says on its website. The colour and consistency of the discharge may change - becoming greyish-white and thin and watery. However,  per cent of women with BV do not have any symptoms. The infection does not usually cause any soreness or itching.

Anne Jensen, , is  weeks pregnant with her first child and decided to swap from vegetarianism to fruitarian three years ago after finding videos about the lestyle on the internet. She now eats nothing but uncooked fruit and veg, claiming that sheaposs never looked back. She said: Before this, I was eating a lot, but it wasnapost the right fuel. Most of my friends are fruitarian too and agree that it’s the healthiest choice and my loved ones are very supportive. “But people online, who don’t understand the raw vegan diet, have been critical, telling me I should be drinking cows’ milk while pregnant to give my baby everything it needs.    “I believe cows’ milk is for cows’ babies, though, and that humans can get all the nutrients they require from plants. Nutrition student Anne, who has lived all over the world but is currently staying in Denmark with her fellow fruitarian boyfriend Grant Painter, . She was vegetarian for eight years but when she was  and living as an au pair in France she started to have bizarre symptoms including muscle shakes and hair loss and felt generally sluggish - prompting her to search the internet for answers. She explained: “I was living with a family there and eating what they ate, which was dferent to my diet back home – lots of cheese, lots of cream and lots of processed food. “I think my body just couldn’t cope. I began to get all sorts of health issues. My muscles would shake, my hair would fall out and I’d feel so tired and sluggish.”  Anne added: “Something in my head clicked that the healthiest way to live was to eat fruit and vegetables – the most natural things in the world. “I didn’t go into it lightly. I spent around a year researching it, reading dferent studies and papers. “I wanted to make sure that I would be able to stick to my new diet, and that it would give me everything I needed, nutrition-wise. “I did worry about things like sugar, as people kept saying how sugary fruit was. The way I understand it, though, the sugar in fruit is completely dferent to the processed kind. That really put my mind at ease. So, three years ago, aged , Anne decided to officially turn fruitarian and says she soon began to see a dference, especially in her energy levels. She continued: “It was a really easy transition. I honestly haven’t missed my old diet. “My muscle shakes and hair loss soon stopped, and I suddenly had so much energy. I was waking up at am and going for runs, with no recovery time afterwards. “I could run a half marathon and feel absolutely fine the next day. Before long, I was running km every morning, just as a way of using some of my extra energy.   “I also noticed things like headaches and period cramps, which I had suffered with before without even really realising, had gone. It’s all these things you don’t realise had been affecting you until they stop.”Since falling pregnant Anne admits she has had to introduce some cooked vegan meals to her diet to help combat nausea. But once her child is born she plans toto a  per cent raw vegan eating plan – and hopes to raise her baby on the same diet. Anne continued: At the moment, I am mostly fruit-based, but do eat the odd cooked meal, as it seems to help with nausea, I’m not sure why. When I’ve given birth, though, I would love toto a completely fruitarian diet and hope my child will do the same – but I will just have to wait and see.” On an average day, she will begin with a ‘monomeal’ – which is made up of just one kind of raw fruit or vegetable – such as three melons, or half a large watermelon. Lunch will usually be smoothie, with one of her favourite recipes entailing blending five bananas with around  dates, fresh berries and water. “That will keep me full for hours,” she added.    For dinner, she will then enjoy a fresh salad made up of spinach, two romaine lettuce heads and tomatoes, as well as a mango, orange and strawberry juice. Grant eats the same things she does – though often adds herbs and spices for extra flavouring. “People follow dferent raw vegan diets. Some people like lots of spices, or nuts and seeds,” she said. “But I prefer to keep it really simple.” Anne, who ed to Denmark in March after living all over the world, from Australia to Thailand, followed a standard diet until she was  years old. Then, in a bid to “fit in” with her school friends, most of whom were vegetarian, she decided to ditch meat. She explained: “Initially, I went vegetarian to be a part of the group. Previously, I’d been a fussy eater, and didn’t like many foods. Once I went vegetarian, though, I found I was eating more and more, and realised that actually, I wasnapost fussy, I just didnapost like meat.  “When I got a little older and read about the ethical, animal rights side of being vegetarian, of course, that was an important factor too.” Towards the beginning of the year, Anne was overjoyed to discover she and Grant were expecting a baby. “From the off, my intention was to stick to my fruitarian diet for as long as I could,” she said of her pregnancy. For four months, she did just that, but recently, she has found her nausea has been getting worse, and so has tweaked her diet slightly in a bid to combat it, introducing the odd cooked vegan meal. And, though she does struggle with morning sickness, she is convinced that being fruitarian has kept her energy levels up as she prepares to bring a new le into the world. Once she gives birth, she plans to listen to her body to work out what sort of diet is best for her, but hopes she can go back to fruitarianism full-time. “I’d love to raise my child as a fruitarian, but I can’t do thatI’m not following the diet myself,” she said. I am planning to breastfeed as long as the baby wants to do so. I know that is the main source of calories for the baby and will introduce food slowly alongside it. “I will just wait and see what is best for my baby.”    By speaking out, Anne hopes to encourage others to consider a fruitarian diet, and is convinced it has improved her health tenfold. Not only that, but she is also passionate about the environmental benefits. “Nothing I eat is in plastic packaging, and there’s very little waste,” she said. “I think it’s better for the planet to be fruitarian. “You also save lots of money, as you aren’t buying treats like takeaways, meals out, or even the odd chocolate bar and can of cola. “Once you get over your old eating habits, it’s really very easy to stick to. I believe that your body will only crave what you’re putting into it, soyou don’t eat junk food, it won’t want junk food. “If you aren’t  per cent passionate, it can seem easy to slip back to your old ways, but you just have to remind yourself of why you are doing this, and how it is best for your body.”   Dr Daniel Atkinson, Clinical Lead of  Treated , said: “The biggest issue with a fruitarian diet is how restrictive it is, because it excludes key nutrients and vitamins like B, which you can only get from animal sources. While whole fruit is healthy, juiced fruit tends to have high sugar concentration, and consuming lots of it might increase the risk of gestational diabetes.“Anaemia is a common issue during pregnancy, and a fruit-heavy diet isn’t rich in iron which might mean you’re more at risk of developing anaemia. If you are pregnant, itaposs better to speak to your doctor or health visitor before making any drastic changes to your diet.

At that time her father was employed as an English teacher at Marr College, later transferring to the village school of Scotlandwell in Perth  Kinross.The family moved to the Borders when Mr Baxter took up the post of schoolmaster at Bowden School, eventually rising to become Director of Education for Roxburghshire County Council.The family set up home at Lindean, with Helenrsquos brother Sandy later taking over the running of Lindean Farm.

Not only are volunteers providing fresh food for locals, they are also regenerating unused spaces, transforming them into lush green patches for all to feast upon. When filming wrapped, reporter Hilary Scott caught up with community gardeners Adam Skelton and Shirley Spence, to ask them how their gardens grow.THE High Street is the heart of the bustling town of Peebles.A derelict bit of land behind the former court building has been transformed into a tranquil greenspace and is now the Courthouse Community Garden.Adam Skelton told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoDuring the filming we discussed Borders Food Community Facebook Group which is a popular place for people to share food, plants, seeds, tools, and materials, as well as advice and information related to food growing, preparing, cooking and storing.ldquoAnyone can join the group free and there you can connect with lots of knowledgeable and very helpful grower, composters, cooks, preservers, picklers. The list goes on.ldquoWe also discussed land sharing. Various group members have allowed us to share their land and create group food gardens.And the Courthouse Community Garden is one of those havens.ldquoIt was an unused overgrown patch of land and we have converted it into a very productive little garden, explained Adam.ldquoThere is no contract or rent and we have not received any funding.The creation of this garden is down to the hard work of green-fingered volunteers and waste products, which Adam says is a ldquowin-win for all involved.He added: ldquoThe land owners get their land tended and access to free fresh food on their doorstep and we get to grow as we wish in this lovely space.Despite the success of Borders Food Community, Adam says he finds it odd that the vast majority of people are not eating truly local food when there are so many benefits.ldquoFor example therersquos the environment. There is no packaging or food miles, itrsquos so much tastier when fresh and all the nutrients intact and its better for local economy.Adam is very passionate about the work of community gardens and is encouraging locals to join Borders Food Community Facebook Group where they can discover their nearest community garden and get involved.The ITV crew headed to Innerleithen in the afternoon to discover a garden maintained by little and large green-fingers.Volunteers from community gardens across the Borders gathered at the Edible Garden along with St Ronanrsquos Primary School pupils.ldquoEveryone who wanted to got the chance to say a few words. It was great to have people from all the community gardens together in one place discussing more ways to collaborate together to further promote local food growing across the Borders, said Adam.The Edible Garden team were delighted to host the ITV Border Le crew.Shirley Spence said: ldquoWe enjoyed meeting the dferent groups of community growers and making new contacts. We were pleased with the comments and feedback about our garden and learning about other community gardens and their work in the Borders.And the children from St Ronanrsquos Primary School also enjoyed their moment in front of the cameras. ldquoThey were talking about what they liked to plant and grow and how gardening has encouraged them to try and eat dferent vegetables and fruits,

discusses impersonating the male courtier Cesario in a foreign court and how dficult that is - I was struck by thevery genuine crisis of identity and expectation that Viola Cesario expresses.\"Joining with Scottish aerialist and National Centre for Circus Arts graduate Adam Wright as performer and choreographer, McKechnie developed a new script from the Bards text and developed the show whilst in residence at the Aerial Edge studio.Charlotte added: \"In the context of the wider play with its interweaving storylines and multiple characters, Viola Cesarios struggle is slightly glossed over, eventually used as a means to a happy ending with her marriage to Orsino.\"I wanted to explore the evolution of her psyche in more detail and a solo show was the perfect way to do that - our audience sees everything from Viola Cesarios perspective.\"Its very raw, and - especially then expressing that inner turmoil purely through movement - its very powerful.\"Using the central monologue as a starting point, I went back through the play and looked at all the scenes particularly pertaining to Viola Cesario and then created a new storyline.\"Viola is performed at the MacArts on Wedbnesday,

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

Firstly, the reader must be able to walk in the subjectrsquos shoes and inhabit their world. It must also have a fair scattering of interesting ndash the more gasp-inducing the better ndash personal anecdotes and revelations. And finally, perhaps most crucially, it should reveal something universal about le itself. Good memoirs have one or two of these attributes great memoirs possess them all.How many ndashany ndash will David Cameronrsquos hotly-anticipated book contain, I wonder  The former prime ministerrsquos memoir, For The Record, is due out in  daysrsquo time, which means by rights I should already be able to answer that question. It is normal protocol for editors and reviewers to be sent copies weeks, sometimes months, in advance, but this book is apparently so hot it will stay under lock and key until the release date of September .Does this mean Mr Cameron is about to spill the beans on Boris Johnson  Does he have something up his sleeve that could bring down his old Eton, Oxford and Bullingdon Club chum  Are we to take it the revelations contained in this book are so explosive they will cause another major tremor in what has been a summer of political earthquakes : Johnson called Cameron a girly swotI fear those of hoping for such an outcome will be let down. After all, with Mr Cameron reportedly paid pound, in advance for the book ndash therersquos also a TV series in the offing ndash itrsquos more likely his publishers are simply ensuring they get plenty of bang for their buck. Indeed,there was anyone left who believed Mr Cameron had been laying low over the last three years because he feels ashamed about the misery and chaos he has inflicted upon the rest of us by holding the EU referendum, the penny must surely have dropped that he is under contract to keep schtum.By rights, of course, this is a man who should, evenonly in print, fall on his knees and beg forgiveness from us all. So arrogant and wrong-headed was his decision-making that we now sit on the precipice of a no-deal Brexit that has the potential to cause economic, political and social misery. Not that wealthy, privileged, cosseted Mr Cameron and his family will suffer its effects, of course, just as he clearly didnrsquot feel any sympathy or responsibility towards the families and communities he and his government plunged into austerity from  onwards.Evenno-deal can be avoided, the damaging isions Mr Camerons referendum created and fed upon will last for generations. To say he changed his country for the worse is an understatement. As for the apology he owes the people of Libya, thatrsquos another can of worms.Andthe memoirs of his predecessors are anything to go by, rather than apology and candour, Mr Cameronrsquos tome will be filled with dull procedure, maddening attempts to deflect blame and crass legacy-making.As for the standard of writing, it will be interesting to seehe has more talent than some of the previous inhabitants of Number . Even that great verbal communicator Tony Blair revealed himself to be a terrible writer his  book overflowed with clicheacute and wince-inducing pop psychology. Werenrsquot there also some really bad sex scenes  Crucially, he refused to confront Iraq.:David Cameron toto political limelight next month to publicise his autobiography For The RecordGordon Brownrsquos memoir ndash with its ghastly title My Le, Our Times ndash was criminally dull, as was John Majorrsquos, which I remember reading on my sickbed in the early Noughties after picking it up in an actual bargain bin for p. I only read two volumes of Mrs Thatcherrsquos autobiography and can attest that despite the grand delusion, at least they werenrsquot boring.For a truly skilled and revelatory take on the political world, we must turn to those who surround the powerful. All three volumes of Alastair Campbellrsquos diaries make for scintillating reading, as do those of the late Tory MP Alan Clark. Neither Campbell nor Clark emerge as likeable people, yet both are talented writers who exude wit, humour and honesty in spades. Their books embed readers in their heads, shock us, and in dferent ways, tell us about the nature of power.Mr Cameronrsquos publishers claim he will ldquotalk candidly, though itrsquos hard to imagine this former PR man, who, in common with his pal Mr Johnson has never seemed burdened by self-doubt, will feel the need or inclination to explain himself to the likes of us. Sorry Dave ndash I fear the giant bargain bin in the ether awaits."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10388883.jpg?type=article-full","title":"auntie-flos-huge-surprise-winner-scottish-album-year","story":"His Radio Highle album was crowned this yearrsquos SAY winner as he played a live set at Skye Live Festival and dished champagne out to the crowd.Brian drsquoSouza, aka Auntie Flo said: ldquoIt feels absolutely incredible to win The Scottish Album of the Year.

So it goes for Eilidh Loanrsquos myth-making Mary Shelley in Rona Munrorsquos new adaptation of Shelleyrsquos much reinvented gothic fantasia, in which strung-out scientist Victor Frankenstein ends up on the receiving end of his own le-giving creative force.By putting Mary onstage at the centre of things rather than a mere framing device, Munro has written something that gets to the heart of the creative process itself. With only hints of whatrsquos going on in her own teenage le, Mary gives full vent to her darkest imaginings, as she allows Michael Morelandrsquos loveless Monster to exact deadly revenge on Ben Castle Gibbrsquos Frankenstein, raising the showrsquos body count to Agatha Christie style proportions.Only in the second act does Mary let Michael Morelandrsquos flesh and blood Monster off the leash and allow him some sense of self-destructive autonomy.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

This will be just one of many such clean ups taking place across the country. As well as helping tidy up our beaches and coastlines, I hope the initiative helps highlight the importance of reducing waste and protecting our precious marine environment”.Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer said: “It’s fantastic to see that local MSP, Liam McArthur, will be joining us at Echna Loch Bay to support our Great British Beach Clean it’s really important for decision-makers to see how much litter, especially plastic, makes its way on to our beaches. We hope that Liam’s attendance at the Great British Beach Clean will encourage local constituents to join us for an eye-opening day on the beaches of Orkney. It#s vital that we all continue to work together to stop the tide of plastic in our oceans.”Constituents looking to join Liam McArthur at the Great British Beach Clean can sign up to volunteer at: www.mcsuk.org greatbritishbeachcleancopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There it remained until , when the then Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, arranged for its transfer to Edinburgh Castle.This exercise in “nationalist unionism” on the part of the Secretary of State had signicant symbolism, as for centuries the presence of Scotland’s historic coronation stone in London had been a source of grievance for the Scottish nation, and not just for those of a Nationalist persuasion. But even at the time of the Stone’sto Scotland, there was much debate as to where it should be located, with a strong case being made for itsto Perthshire.The future of the Stone is again in the news, with the Scottish Government having launched a consultation on whether or not it should be moved from Edinburgh to Perth, where the Conservative-led council has ambitious plans for it to become the centrepiece of a proposed new museum and visitor attraction in the former Perth City Halls. This development is supported by £ million from the UK Government by way of the Tay Cities Deal.: SNP heavyweights call for Stone of Destiny to be relocated from Edinburgh to PerthFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThe alternative is to retain the Stone at Edinburgh Castle, in a redevelopment of the existing, rather disappointing, display, which has the Stone sitting ignominiously, and almost unnoticed, in a glass case alongside the Scottish Crown jewels. The Stone of Scone, as it is often known, is certainly of signicant historical importance. According to legend, it was Jacob’s pillow from Biblical times, which came to Scotland by way of Ireland and became the seat on which Kings of Scots were crowned.Whether the Stone that we know today, a block of Perthshire sandstone, is really this historic relic is a matter of debate it is widely believed that the monks of Scone concealed the real Stone when Edward’s men came knocking and palmed them off with a fake.: Edinburgh MSPs say Stone of Destiny should stay in Capital: Salmond: ‘Stone of Destiny is fake’But evenit is not, the Stone that sits in Edinburgh is nevertheless an artefact of signicant historical interest, of which the Kings of England, and then monarchs of Great Britain, have been crowned ever since the th century. And, in the absence of the ‘real’ Stone, it is all we have. I have for many years been a supporter of the campaign to have the Stone brought back to Perthshire, and now is the perfect opportunity to make that happen.As the centrepiece of a new development in the centre of Perth, the Stone will be presented in its appropriate historical context. The whole project has potentially enormous economic signicance for the local area, and will bring both locals and visitors into the city centre of Perth in large numbers.It is hard to see what economic benefit exists from retaining the Stone at Edinburgh Castle, already Scotland’s busiest tourist attraction. I cannot believe the argument that visitor numbers to the Castle would in any way diminish were the Stone to be removed. Moreover, there is no historical connection between the Stone and Edinburgh, in that prior to  it had never rested in the Scottish capital.I am encouraged that the Scottish Government is now running a consultation on the question of the location of the Stone, and I have absolutely no doubt that now is the time toit home to Perthshire. I would encourage those who share my view to complete the consultation, which is open until  September. Whether we care about the economic prosperity of Perth and Perthshire, or are interested in ensuring that our cultural heritage is properly recognised, this is the right step to take.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"looking back when a young jacob rees mogg campaigned in scotland with his nanny","story":"The Scotsman recalls his first foray into Scottish politics.Brexit campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg started his political career back in Rees-Mogg was just  when he was selected by the Conservatives to contest Central Fe ndash a traditional Labour seat ndash at the  general election.The Etonian travelled to Scotland with a mind to hitting the campaign trail, but his upper-class background soon put him at odds with a largely working-class electorate.The son of late Times editor William, Rees-Mogg made the inauspicious decision to knock on doors in the former mining town of Leven on the Fe coast.But reports quickly emerged of the English candidate taking the familyrsquos nanny, Veronica Crook, in tow during canvassing while driving around the back streets of Fe in a Bentley.Rees-Mogg turned into cannon fodder, particularly for the tabloid newspapers.He was photographed in a pin-stripe suit visiting the doors of constituents in the Broom estate in Leven.Declarations by Rees-Mogg that people on benefits were the ldquoscourge of the earth didnrsquot help his position.Adding to his back story were reports of Rees-Mogg having to be saved by his Labour opponent Henry McLeish from being beaten up.McLeish told the Daily Record earlier this year: ldquoAt one point, somebody threatened to come onto the  and beat him up.ldquoA touching part to that was that after saving him from a potential duffing up, his father, the very distinguished editor of the Times, William Rees-Mogg, sent me a letter thanking me for how Irsquod managed to protect him, for which he was very grateful.Why your new suitable cabin baggage might actually fall foul of Ryanair rulesldquoIt was a delightful letter, basically saying lsquoI donrsquot often write to Labour MPs, but I would like to thank you very, very sincerely for the way you looked after my sonrsquo.ldquoJacob was like a fish out of water and clearly bewildered by places like Methil and Kennoway.ldquoI did not get the feeling he was the dangerous ideologue extremist we know him as today.ldquoHe was reasonably well behaved in my company because I think he was in fear of his le.ldquoThe fact he is looked upon by some as a future Prime Minister seems well beyond the realms of comprehension.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sunflowers for sharon","story":"MOUNT Eagles roundabout has been transformed into a “sunflower garden” in support of resident and West Belfast’s own ‘sunflower’ Sharon McCloskey.The mother-of-three is currently undergoing a stem cell transplant as she continues to battle an extremely rare form of leukemia.Sinn Féin Councillor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that the sunflower planting was the communities way of showing Sharon and her family that they are behind them.“When we all found about Sharon’s news, obviously our hearts went out to her but there was a real sense of hope and that came from her family and friends,” he said.“We really saw and felt that at one of the early stem cell registration events at the Mount Eagles Community Centre.

However, there is no burial register available for the institution and it cannot be veried.Many of the children who died in the Tuam home are buried in  underground chambers which could have been used for treatment of water or containment of sewage, dating back to .In January this year, Tuam survivors called for their DNA samples to be “banked” for future identication of remains found during the excavation of the site, in light of the health status of those involved, much of whom are elderly.In response, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Dr Katherine Zappone had asked Dr Shannon to consider what actions may be possible under existing legislation.The purpose of collecting samples would be to later compare them against any DNA profiles which may be generated from the juvenile human remains found at the Tuam site and,possible, to make positive identications.I am keen to give every possible opportunity to survivors and family members to try and identy the remains of those who they hold dear in their heartsDr Katherine ZapponeDr Shannon’s report,  pages long, considers what may be possible within the current legislative framework, with particular reference to how best to ensure that the rights of those who give biological samples are safeguarded in respect of sensitive personal data and informed consent.Dr Shannon concluded that it should be possible to develop such a scheme, even before the new legislation related to the discovery of remains at Tuam, which is currently being developed by the Department, has been implemented.However, he added that the State should be actively working to enact legislation for the collection, storage and processing of close relatives’ biological samples, for the purposes of carrying out a matching process with the exhumed remains from Tuam.However, no DNA profiles will be generated from the biological samples until the new legislation is in place and it has been proven possible to generate DNA profiles from the juvenile remains.The report stresses that any scheme would have to be operated on the basis of informed consent in order to satisfy GDPR and constitutional requirements around data protection, and a Data Protection Officer must be designated.Participants should be able to decide to withdraw at any time and request that their sample and the information held about them be destroyed.Minister Zappone said: “Following Dr Shannon’s report, I intend to request my officials to develop an appropriate voluntary administrative scheme to collect those samples, subject to legal advice.“As he pointed out, it is not yet clear whether or not it will be possible to generate DNA profiles from the juvenile human remains that are of such a quality that will result in them being capable of yielding familial matches.“I do not believe that this should be a barrier to hope and I am keen to give every possible opportunity to survivors and family members to try and identy the remains of those who they hold dear in their hearts.“My officials will now consult further with our legal advisers and relevant agencies towards developing an appropriate voluntary administrative scheme in the coming months.”"},{"url":null,"title":"york minster sells historic organ pipes to raise refurbishment funds","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Competing in the competition for the first time, Andrew ploughed excellently over both days, winning a bronze medal on day one.With an aggregate score over the two days of competition used to crown the world champion, it was all to plough for on day two which focused on grassland.And Andrew was in good company with three former world champions making up the top five positions on the first day.He ploughed another fantastic plot to finish in fth place on day two, which placed him fourth overall, picking up the best newcomer award.Andrew said it has always been his dream to compete at the world contest.ldquoIt has been an unbelievable experience and I am so delighted to have won a medal. I am indebted for all the support I have received, particularly from my family, he said.Listooder Ploughing Society chairman Martin Gill spoke of his delight following the gala awards presentation.He said: ldquoTo go to the world contest for the first time, using borrowed equipment and to compete with the best in the world, winning a bronze medal and best newcomer title is a fantastic achievement.ldquoListooder has a long and successful history in ploughing. All three of our members who have competed at the world contest have all come home medal winners.In the reversible class, Hillsboroughrsquos James Coulter, who was also competing at the world contest for the first time, produced another fantastic performance.After finishing th on day one, James ploughed a fantastic plot the day after to win a bronze medal on grassland, finishing fourth overall and winning the best newcomer for the class.There will be little time for Andrew and James to celebrate as they prepare to compete in the Northern Ireland Championships at Cookstown this weekend..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin primary school opens new sensory garden  ","story":"CHILDREN, teachers and parents at St Maryrsquos Primary School, Aughlisnafin, celebrated the completion of a sensory garden and outdoor learning centre at the school with a barbecue and family fun night last Friday.The garden was officially opened by the school principal, Paddy Hardy, and Laura Brennan, chairperson of the schoolrsquos parent-teacher association.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service and the RNLI were in attendance to advise the children on fire and water safety.Another special guest was Down gaelic footballer Rory Burns, who took on the children in a lsquoBeat the Goaliersquo competition.The school staff got involved by raising funds with a lsquoSponge the Teacherrsquo event which was a highlight for the children.A total of pound, was raised from all the activities and the barbecue.The school wishes to Fresh Food Centre, Castlewellan, Finnegans Butchers, Castlewellan, and Eurospar, Clough, for their donations.The school also wishes to thank everyone who attended the event for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Ban.jpg","title":"Ban on circuses with live animals  ","story":"CIRCUSES using live animals will be banned from performing throughout the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.The move calling for the council not to grant entertainment licences to circuses using live animals was passed at Monday nightrsquos full council meeting.It echoes back to a previous ban enforced by the legacy Down District Council which prohibited circuses with live animals performing on council facilities.The notice of motion, tabled by Alliance councillor Patrick Brown, was supported by  councillors. The only dissenting voice came from the DUPrsquos Harry Harvey, who voted against.The DUP councillor took an alternative view on the perceived harmful effect that circus le has on animals.Cllr Harvey said: ldquoI wonrsquot be supporting this motion as circus animals are very well trained and well trained animals are generally happy and well looked after.Cllr Brown told the meeting that many animals travelling with circuses were ldquosubjected to constantly being moved around cramped temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and intimidating crowds of people.He continued: ldquoTravelling circus le is likely to have a harmful effect on animal welfare as captive animals are unable to socialise, get enough exercise or exhibit natural behaviours. Many animals develop behavioural and or health problems as a direct result of the captive le that they are forced to lead.He said that a recent report commissioned by the Welsh Government concluded that: ldquoLe for wild animals in travelling circuses... does not appear to constitute either a lsquogood lersquo or a lsquole worth livingrsquo.ldquoThe Irish government recently saw footage from the Animal Defenders International group which showed elephants and camels being repeatedly punched and hit with sticks to perform, said Cllr Brown.He added: ldquoIn May, the UK Government announced it would be banning wild animals in circuses from early . The Irish Government banned wild animals in January .ldquoAs usual, this being a devolved issue, Northern Ireland is behind the times yet again. This issue was actually raised in the Assembly as far back as  by my good friend Jim Wells MLA, who was very critical of the failure of Michelle OrsquoNeillrsquos Agriculture department to include such provisions in the Welfare of Animals Act .The councillor argued that some of the worldrsquos best circuses, such as the Cirque de Soleil, ddid not use any animals which ldquoreflects a global trend towards human-centered performances that no longer use animals, including the Russian and Chinese state circuses.He added: ldquoHopefully council will lead the way on animal welfare and pass this motion.The motion was seconded by fellow Alliance councillor Gregory Bain.Downpatrick SDLP councillor John Trainer, who also supported the motion said circuses did not provide a natural habitat for animals.DUP councillor Billy Walker, UUP councillor David Taylor and Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Willie Clarke all supported the motion on behalf of their respective parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Community.jpg","title":"Community bid to halt church’s sale of Crossgar centre  ","story":"CHURCH officials in Crossgar are being asked to abort plans to sell a building and consider donating it to local people instead.The community centre in Downpatrick Street mdash which was a former pub mdash was purchased two decades ago but is now on the market for sale as a commercial unit.Representatives of the Church of the Immaculate Conception and St Joseph are planning to meet with community representatives to explain the reasons for the sale which are understood to centre around increased running costs and reduced numbers of people using the facility.Community officials have expressed an interest in working with Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take over the running of the building,agreement could be reached to donate it to the people of Crossgar.They believe that the building offers major potential and could be developed to provide a range of services to meet the needs of a wide range of cross-community groups in the village.Community representatives want the meeting with church officials to be open to localpeople, arguing that a lot of public money has already been invested in the property over recent years which is used by the Crossgar Youth League among others.ldquoThe building could be transformed into a modern community centre with the right investment and commitment. There is a parking area at the rear with spaces for around  vehicles andthese are lost what happens, especially during the summer months when the villagersquos popular Youth League is in full flow, said one community official.ldquoLocal people have been using the property for around  years and we would very much like church officials to consider donating it to them so they can take it over and work with others to manage the running costs.Community officials say there was a need for a dedicated indoor community facility in Crossgar which would meet the needs of many groups and organisations.The added ldquoplans for a major new sports complex unveiled a number of years never came to fruition and were unlikely to in the future.Officials believe thatthe Downpatrick Street building was donated to the people of the village, its future as a community base could potentially be guaranteed.Community officials insist that one of their key priorities is looking after Crossgar Youth League which continues to go from strength to strength and also uses the car park at the rear of the building to store equipment.ldquoIt is no onersquos fault that the Downpatrick Street building is being sold. If there are concerns around its running costs why doesnrsquot the parish come and talk to us and give us the opportunity to work alongside others and take it over  suggested one community official.ldquoThere was a major push to open this building many years ago and a lot of public money was invested in it. The property is critical to the success of the Crossgar Youth League and is an enormous community benefit. It is the best thing we have in the village.ldquoThe loss of the building would have an enormous impact on the Youth League and indeed the Crossgar community. There is potential to do so much with the property and we hope it is not lost to the people of the village.

Existing paths will also be upgraded.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker mdash who has been lobbying for the existing pedestrian crossing to be upgraded mdash is delighted that it is finally going to happen.ldquoThe scheme has been included in the Department for Infrastructurersquos programme and will be installed as pat of the forthcoming environmental improvement scheme, he explained.ldquoI am delighted that after years of lobbying, this much-needed scheme is finally now in the programme and will be delivered. I hope that it will be delivered as soon as possible, given the huge volume of traffic which passes through the centre of the town each day.Cllr Walker said a number of traffic surveys have been carried out over the years to determine the need for an upgraded crossing and is pleased that one is finally going to be delivered and will be paid for by the Department for Infrastructure.ldquoThe importance of this puffin crossing cannot be highlighted enough, he continued. ldquoThe new crossing will see the provision of Killyleaghrsquos first set of traffic lights which in itself is signicant. The traffic lights will ensure drivers come to a complete halt while people are crossing.Cllr Walker said a number of people using the existing pedestrian crossing were hit by cars, while there were ldquocountless near misses.ldquoWhen people press the button on the new puffin crossing, traffic will stop immediately to allow them to cross safely. My thanks go to roads officials for finally agreeing that an upgraded crossing is necessary, he continued.ldquoThe biggest concern many in Killyleagh have is the speed of vehicles approaching Catherine Street from the Comber direction. The new puffin crossing will address this issue at what is a particularly busy main street which is notoriously dficult to cross, even with the presence of the current crossing.Cllr Walker said people need to be able to bring traffic to a halt so they can cross in safety. He is also delighted with the planned environmental improvement scheme and has no doubt it will have a positive impact on the town centre.He added: ldquoA number of similar schemes carried out in other towns and villages across the district have had a signicant impact, helping restore pride and encouraging businesses and residents to spruce up their respective premises.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed the council was developing proposals to bring forward seven environmental improvement schemes across the district, one of which is proposed for Killyleagh.ldquoIt is anticipated that this will include upgrade works to pathways, street lighting and street furniture, he explained.ldquoImplementation of the works is however subject to planning approval and the council being successful in an application for funding to the Rural Development Programme.

But he conceded that theof -hour AE services may be dficult.Mr McGoran was invited to address the Down Community Health Committee and said it was important that the South Eastern Trust was having a conversation with campaigners who are keen to continue discussions with officials to ensure the retention of existing services and the delivery of enhanced provision moving forward.Over previous years, relations between both organisations was particularly fraught at times and while they did not always see eye to eye, Mr McGoran hopes they can now move forward together.He said he had ldquonothing but respect for the Down community because local people cared about their health and social care services, committing time and energy to make sure the area gets the best provision it can.ldquoThis is not always obvious everywhere in Northern Ireland, Mr McGoran continued. ldquoYou have been at this for a long time and I have no doubt that without your campaigning work we would not have some of the things we have in this organisation today. I am also not sure that we would have the Downe Hospital.ldquoYour contribution and those who went before you has been fundamental in keeping this area in the spotlight, fighting ultimately for your services. I take my hat off to you. The Downe is here to stay and we have a fantastic facility and there are no staff better. In fact, we have incredible staff who work right across the organisation.Mr McGoran said that while administrators and campaigners may not have always agreed in the past about how the health trust did things, he suggested they all had the same aim mdashwanting the best health and social care that could be delivered, sometimes within challenging resources.Looking to the future, the health chief referred to an ongoing review of emergency care which has resulted in the group overseeing the exercise visiting the Downe and meeting with senior health officials.ldquoI do envisage that there is going to be further change for emergency medicine but when I was asked the question what did I think about the future of the service at the Downe, Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals in  yearsrsquo time, I could not really answer that, explained Mr McGoran.ldquoI was prepared to say what it would be like in five yearsrsquo time, but could not look beyond that. A five year vision is really something that you can get a hold of and we made it clear to those in charge of the review that the emergency care model we have in place at the Downe will be here in five yearsrsquo time.Mr McGoran said the health trust was on record with the Department of Health during the early stages of the current engagement that it still sees the current model at the Downe comprising the emergency department, out of hours GP service and weekend nurse-led minor injuries unit remaining in place.ldquoWe will still have acute beds in the Downe and it will deal with medically unwell patients. All of the current infrastructure we have will remain in place and our vision is to expect these to remain in place for the next five years, he confirmed.Mr McGoran said the one caveat was that it remained to be seen what the Department of Health will do with the information it has been provided with in relation to the future of emergency care, suggesting serious conversations about the way forward have only just begun.He added: ldquoThere is work ongoing and at some point there may be a consultation exercise. I do not know where all this is going to go and it is a bit early to speculate.Community Health Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady welcomed the health officialrsquos ldquoconstructive and honest engagement with campaigners.He said: ldquoWe need to go forward in a partnership, but that does not mean that we will always agree. Our community supports the Downe Hospital and also the centres of excellence in the bigger hospitals that our delivering our health needs.ldquoBut we need as much care as possible provided as locally as possible, safely and well adequately resourced in a brilliant building.Mr McGrady added: ldquoI hope that in five yearsrsquo time we will be looking at a very major extension at the Downe and a major increase in capacity.

Deirdre, cheering her along the . mile route.The student nurse completed the distance in five hours and  minutes, starting off from her Loughinisland home close to the Teconnaught Road club just after am.She did a km cycle ride yesterday and plans to do  s of the m pool in Bangor today.Eimear has already raised her pound, target to support Daisy Lodge in Newcastle and little Katie Rose McKeown from Armagh in her on-going fight against cancer.However, she hopes that more donations will be made as her challenge continues this week.Speaking on Monday night, Eimear said that she was feeling surprisingly fresh and strong in her legs after completing her first road marathon.ldquoI finished at .am with no one  there only my mum cheering me on, said Eimear. ldquoWe both went off afterwards to Brennanrsquos for breakfast and when we got home I went and had a cold bath and it seemed to really help with my legs.She said that after she reached  miles, she celebrated every next mile as she

Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain. Disappointed spectators had their money refunded.The fireworks bonanza, sponsored by Down District Council, was to have marked the end of the Percy French Festival.However, the stage will now switch to Downpatrick in October where a successful display was staged last year.ARDGLASS mdash Suki, the cat escaped a horrible death at Ardglass harbour recently, has found a new home in Lisburn.The story about how Suki survived an attempt to have her drowned aroused so much interest that the person who found her, Mrs Joan Owens, was inundated with phone calls to give the cat a home.Mrs Owens, of Ardgtreenan Crescent, Belfast, accepted the first of more than  calls and the cat left for its new home in Dundrod Walk, Lisburn, earlier this week.ldquoSomeone had tried to get rid of the cat, Mrs Owens explained. ldquoSuki was tied in a paper bag and thrown off the side of the harbour, but instead of hitting the waves she landed in our cabin cruiser, which was anchored.ldquoWhen we were taking our boat out of the water for repairs to the hull we came across a torn bag on the deck. Then we heard noises from a cabin mdash and found Suki mothering three new kittens.ldquoUnfortunately, we had to have the three kittens put down and Suki neutered. And then when our two tom cats took a dislike to Suki we were forced to appeal for a home for her.Mrs Owens added: ldquoThe response was overwhelming and the first of many callers took Suki away. My husband, Jim, and I will be ing to our caravan at Ardtole, near Ardglass, this weekend. We hope we donrsquot find any more animals in distress!DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos new maternity hospital, which is due to replace the Hardy Greer House unit early in the New Year, will not become fully operational until staffing dficulties can be resolved.It is expected that an advertising campaign is to be mounted shortly for all grades of staff required in the bright, new up-to-date hospital.The -bed unit in the grounds of the Downshire Hospital will require up to % more midwery staff than the -bed Hardy Greer House on the Strangford Road, which seems to be permanently under-staffed and struggling along.The new unit will also accommodate an out-patient centre which will mean the transfer of ante-natal and post-natal work which is currently conducted at Downe Hospital.The expected completion date for the new building is November. It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables. The judges had a dficult task in deciding who won what.The standard was again very high in the eight sections with encouraging entries in the bread, cake, jam, handiwork, flowers and vegetable classes. After the judging the ious articles were sold at bargain prices, raising almost pound for church funds.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh artist Leo Casement is making a big name for himself in France. Leo set off for Europe last year after staging a successful one-man exhibition in Downpatrick Library.Now many of his paintings are finding their way into French homes and the name Leo Casement is appearing in French newspapers.Leo had originally indicated that he might be ing home at the end of this month, but he has put his travelling boots on again and is in Amsterdam at the moment.PORTAFERRY mdash Euro MP John Taylor has joined the fight of Portaferry residents, who are angry about the new sewage works scheme which they say will be pumping untreated sewage into Strangford Lough.Mr Taylor is to table a question at this monthrsquos meeting of the European Parliament, askingthe scheme is receiving financial backing from the EEC.Mr Taylor is also demanding to knowthe plant would qualy for help from the EEC regional aid fund,it was modied to include the treatment of sewage.The Euro MP, who was the site engineer in charge of the storm drainage scheme in Portaferry in the late s and who says he has a good knowledge of the problem encountered by residents, intends bluntly askingthe EEC encourages the disposal of raw effluent into the lough.KEARNEY mdash A yacht which was taking part in a race from Bangor to Portpatrick in Scotland struck rocks at Kearney Point on the Ards Peninsula during thick fog at the weekend.Donaghadee Leboat answered the Mayday call and towed the boat and the eight people on board to safety.Yachtsmen competing in the race, organisedby Royal Ulster Yacht Club, said that conditions were probably the worst experienced for the event.The crews found it most dficult with the thick sea mist cutting visibility down to  yards at times as rain lashed down. Only a handful of the  boats finished the course, which started in Bangor via Strangford to Portpatrick.PORTAVOGIE mdash Portavogie fishermen wishing to haul out their boats look like having an easier time in front of them this winter because the NI Fisheries Harbour Authority have ordered a special winch which they hope to have in operation soon.The winch has been ordered from Butters Cranes, Glasgow, and will be able to handle up to  tonnes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Lighthouse.jpg","title":"Lighthouse beam must be preserved  ","story":"THE campaign group lobbying for the retention of the iconic sweeping beam at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse near Killough has again insisted that it must be preserved, with the building developed to provide a leading tourist attraction.The Lecale Lightkeepers have written to the Commissioners of Irish Lightsmdash which wants to remove the beam powered by a six ton Fresnel lamp and replace it with an LED light mdash highlighting the importance of retaining the beam in its current form for future generations.Campaigners say that the century-old beam must not be confined to the pages of history, warning CIL thatit persists with its controversial plan, it will miss a ldquotremendous opportunity to preserve both the iconic lighthouse and its beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers say the beam, which is an integral part of the lighthousersquos heritage and a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape, must be retained for people to enjoy.CIL has argued that because the current lamp rotates in a bath of mercury and poses a health and safety risk, it is looking at designing a new mechanism which would allow the mercury to be removed.However, campaigners do not agree, claiming that such an option would be expensive to operate and, most signicantly, alter the character of the light.They have also branded claims that the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the lens.In a letter to the Dublin-based CIL, campaigners say they remain as ldquocommitted as ever to preserving the sweeping beam which is important to the local community.In July, CIL confirmed that trials of an alternate bearing system were ongoing but it was unable to make a final determination as to the suitability of such a system.Seeking an update on the trials, campaigners say they have held since the outset that a solid metal-on-solid metal bearing ldquodefies common sense as a practical approach since the energy necessary to overcome the friction forces therein would be costly and the apparatus itself require lubrication and continuous maintenance.ldquoSuch problems were addressed successfully by Messrs Bourdelles  Fresnel, the distinguished French lighthouse engineers in the th century and their designs, including the almost frictionless mercury bearing, were employed in lighthouse construction world-wide, including Ireland and at St Johnrsquos Point in , the letter continues.ldquoWe believe it is an established fact that any potential hazard to health by mercury vapour can be managed by adequate ventilation. This was foreseen in the design of St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse where there is excellent lantern sidewall and cowling ventilation in a tower  feet above the ground in this remote location. There is little hazard from the liquid mercury since it is not readily absorbed dermally.Campaigners have suggested that it would be interesting to see CILrsquos lighthouse keeper health monitoring records for mercury covering the past  years and more when the lighthouse was manned and used the present system. They also said it would be interestingto see the training records for keepers in safe mercury handling during all these years. ldquoPresumably, these would have been managed by independent bodies of experts since the Commissioners probably didnrsquot previously have and donrsquot today have any toxicological experts on your permanent payroll, says the campaigners letter.Another area of concern highlighted is the poor state of the lighthouse, including adjoining housing which a delegation from the Commissionerrsquos office recently visited.Campaigners point to the ldquolamentable state of the walls of the lighthouse station and the grounds, suggesting that they present a picture of ldquowoeful neglect and asking how CIL can expect the public to be impressed with a lack of basic asset maintenance.The letter highlights that the current Fresnel lens system turns  hours a day and is clearly visible from the road outside the lighthouse station.Campaigners say this in itself is a visual attraction during daylight hours ldquosince the magnicent large lens system is big enough to be seen turning on itrsquos mercury bearing and is even more magnicent at night.The letter continues: ldquoWe believe that CIL will miss a tremendous opportunity to preserve this lighthouse and its sweeping beamyou persist with your alternative bearing plans. The whole lighthouse station could become part of a wider tourist attraction in the area. Future generations will thank you for retaining the current historic beam system, still going smoothly after  years and showing no signs of obsolescence. You have not made an economic case for change of lens system at St Johnrsquos Point as far as we know and it is dficult to see how you can.ldquoWhat happens at the lighthouse remains the focus of keen and widespread local and political interest in this area and we will ensure this continues to be a high-profile local issue.The letter adds: ldquoLecale Lightkeepers are willing to fully support CIL and others in any preservation programme that involves retaining the sweeping beam. However, we reject the idea that the use of mercury in this lens bearing application represents a health hazard that cannot be managed by a sensible, low-cost maintenance programme involving chiefly adequate ventilation.

I will not comment on the details, but I might have thought that that money — even at this late stage — could be given to charity. That would be no bad thing.”Last month the News Letter revealed that Mr Smith had reinstated photos of the Queen which had been removed in .A source close to Secretary of State said at the time: “The Secretary of State was clear that the Head of State’s image should be on display in Stormont House.”Prorogation Unlawful: The advice given by the government to Her Majesty the Queen to prorogue

Image: BBC SpotlightAlthough it has long been known that Mr McGuinness was an IRA commander, he refused to discuss his actions in the organisation and insisted that he had never killed anyone.The images will be broadcast next Tuesday in the first part of one of BBC Northern Ireland’s most ambitious projects, a two-year re-examination of the Troubles which will run over seven programmes. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The first programme in the series also includes a former colonel saying that he was shown evidence by the RUC that Ian Paisley, the future First Minister, had supplied the money for explosives which caused one of the first explosions of the Troubles.The rare footage of an IRA car bomb being assembled was filmed in Londonderry in the early years of the Troubles.During the programme, former IRA bomber Shane Paul O’Doherty commentated on the pictures, saying: “There’s a huge charge there. A very dangerous alarm clock timer that could blow them all to hell.”When asked who he recognised, he said: “Well, there’s Martin....Martin McGuinness.” Mr O’Doherty said he was certain that it was the future deputy First Minister, saying “nobody walks like him, with a stoop in his back”.The car containing the bomb could be identied by its number plate. The BBC programme includes footage of the bomb exploding  minutes later in the centre of Mr McGuinness’s home city, Londonderry.The day after the bombing, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London to be told that security powers would be removed from Stormont and taken on by Westminster, leading to the collapse of Stormont.The Spotlight programme also includes footage of Mr McGuinness showing guns to young children and handing them bullets while seated in a car.Commentating on the film pictures, Mr O’Doherty said: “It’s Martin McGuinness. Very young, tall, handling weapons – a rle and a revolver – rolling up to a load of kids who are staring in the windows, craning in the windows and showing them bullets.“It’s horric, really, because here was McGuinness showing eight, nine and -year-olds guns and bullets that were exciting. People had a feeling that you were on television, you know, you were superstars.”Police had evidence Ian Paisley paid for Troubles bombing, says ex-colonel Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The programme does not explain the background to the footage. However, Spotlight reporter Darragh MacIntyre said that it would be made clear in a future film in the series.He said that it had been shot by an American documentary maker and was never broadcast.Mr McIntyre, the reporter who in  exposed the then DUP MP Iris Robinson’s affair and financial dealings with property developers, said that the  footage “speaks to a time when within Free Derry and where in the north there was a sense that the IRA had it won, that they were the original guerrilla fighters and within a matter of months would see their way to a new united Ireland...so they were quite free - not just Martin McGuinness - when they were filming with this documentary team”.In , Mr McGuinness told the journalist Eamonn Mallie that he was “very proud that I was a part of the IRA in Derry” but declined to say whether he had ever killed anyone.Last month, former IRA member Kieran Conway said that as the IRA’s chief of staff at the time of the attack which killed Lord Mountbatten and others, including two children, Mr McGuinness had to “take responsibility” for what had happened that day.Another former IRA man, Anthony McIntyre, said of that attack: “If they knew about the children, and were quite prepared to go ahead and to sacrice their lives in order to get Mountbatten, then it’s a war crime”.However, Sinn Féin MLA and former IRA man Raymond McCartney denounced such criticism of Mr McGuinness, saying that he was “held in the highest of esteem across Ireland and internationally”.The Foyle MLA said: “It is reprehensible that anyone would make unfounded allegations against a man who is no longer here to defend himself.”Spotlight on The Troubles – a Secret History involve two -minute programmes and five hour-long episodes. The series has been overseen by editor Jeremy Adams, deputy editor Gwyneth Jones and producer Chris Thornton. It involves three senior Spotlight reporters – Darragh MacIntyre, Jenner O’Leary and Mandy McAuley.The first programme will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Tuesday at .pm and will also be shown on BBC

Dominic Grieve Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"In terms of timescales, one in three unionists believe a border poll is likely to happen in the next ten years - as do nine in ten nationalists.Although a majority of voters think that in a referendum tomorrow Northern Ireland would choose to remain part of the UK, when asked what the outcome would be in ten years time most believe the vote would be for unication, with only three in ten believing voters would choose the UK.Brexit was a major theme in the poll, which highlighted a favourability to the backstop in order to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal, and the possibility of a re-emerging hard border.Given the choice between leaving with a deal that includes the backstop or leaving with no-deal, six in ten Northern Ireland voterssaid they would choose the backstop.However, only one in five unionists say they are prepared to accept it and % would rather leave with no-deal.Nearly eight in ten unionists believe the backstop \"separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK in unacceptable ways and the government should not agree to any deal that includes it\".Lord Ashcrofts last poll in Scotland similarly found a slight lead for leaving the UK and Scotland becoming an independent country.try

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy.
