Photograph:  Stefan RousseauReutersJeremy Corbyn has fought off an attempt to change Labour’s policy on Brexit by committing the party to a second referendum in all circumstances. The ruling national executive committee (NEC) agreed after a five-hour meeting on Tuesday to retain the current policy that identifies a second referendum as “an option” if Labour cannot force changes to Theresa May’s deal or trigger a general election.“Labour’s European elections manifesto was agreed at the NEC today and it will be published soon,” a party spokesman said. “The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour’s existing policy to support Labour’s alternative plan, and if we can’t get the necessary changes to the government’s deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote.”Pro-Europeans led by deputy leader Tom Watson wanted the manifesto to commit Labour to putting any Brexit deal approved by MPs to a confirmatory referendum. After the meeting,some pro-European MPs claimed that the decision meant that a vote for Labour could still open the way for a second referendum.However, Gloria De Piero, a Midlands MP who insists that the outcome of the 2016 referendum must be respected, also welcomed the decision.“Labour’s manifesto for the European parliament will not contain a pledge to hold a second Brexit referendum.The party’s ruling national executive committee agreed that another nationwide poll should only be “an option” if it cannot force a general election.” The Scottish National Party (SNP), Change UK and the Liberal Democrats said the NEC’s decision showed that Labour was not committed to a second referendum. The SNP’s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, accused the Labour leader of conspiring with “a Tory-led Brexit shambles”.“Jeremy Corbyn today had an opportunity to help bring an EU referendum closer, but instead he has chosen to continue his complicity in the Tories’ plan to remove us from the EU.” Indicative votesMrs May wants talks with Labour over a common approach to Brexit to conclude by the middle of next week. If the two sides fail to agree a common approach, the government will schedule a series of indicative votes on options for Brexit, probably including a customs union and a second referendum.Two former Conservative ministers, Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan, said on Tuesday that they would chair a new initiative to develop “alternative arrangements” for the Border to avoid the Northern Ireland backstop.\u0026nbspThe Alternative Arrangements Commission will seek to develop detailed proposals to avoid physical infrastructure at the Border with\u0026nbsp“comprehensive customs co-operation arrangements, facilitative arrangements and technologies” as set out in a document agreed between Britain and the EU in Strasbourg in March.The commission said it had engaged a technical panel of border and customs experts, practitioners and lawyers with detailed knowledge of trade, business and community relationships in Ireland, as well as EU, UK and international trade regulations.“Nine working groups have been created covering topics including the Border and the movement of people in the context of the Good Friday agreement, tax, sanitary and phytosanitary standards, small traders and trusted trader schemes,” the commission said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3876123.1556651480!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"venezuelan opposition leader juan guaid%C3%B3 calls for military uprising","story":"Defying a tear-gas assault by security forces, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido has called on president Nicolas Maduro to step aside.

Photograph: Miguel GutierrezEPAVenezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó has taken to the streets to issue a bold call for a nationwide uprising to oust Nicolás Maduro, counting on military support to topple the crisis-stricken country’s socialist leader.Dozens of armed men in military uniform accompanying Mr Guaidó exchanged gunfire with soldiers supporting Mr Maduro on Tuesday, as crowds of people converged on La Carlota military base in central Caracas where Mr Guaidó made the announcement.They tried to push their way in but were repelled. Many later moved to Plaza Altamira in eastern Caracas, a traditional seat of opposition activity.In his trademark dark suit and white shirt, Mr Guaidó stood on top of a car and addressed the crowd via a megaphone. He called on Venezuelans to “come to Altamira. Here we will resist. Operation Liberty has begun”.Supporters, who included uniformed members of the Venezuelan security forces, responded by chanting: “Yes, we can!”The unrest is the latest manifestation of a three-month push for Venezuela’s Assembly, and says that the constitution has been usurped by Mr Maduro following elections last year that were widely considered illegitimate.In response, Mr Maduro published a tweet calling on the people of Venezuela to have “nerves of steel” and asking pro-regime militias to gather outside the Miraflores presidential palace.Mr Maduro, who did not appear in public, said he had spoken to military units around the country “who have expressed their total loyalty to the people, to the constitution and to the fatherland”.As events unfolded senior US officials threw their weight behind Mr Guaidó. Tweets from Mike Pence, the US vice-president, Mike Pompeo, secretary of state, and John Bolton, national security adviser, welcomed Mr Guaidó’s call for the military to turn on the government.“We are with you!” Mr Pence tweeted. “America will stand with you until freedom \u0026amp democracy are restored.”ProtestersRussia accused opponents of Mr Maduro of inciting violence and called for the international community to help calm the situation.Live TV pictures showed La Carlota military base surrounded by thousands of people. Most were calm, although scores of protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers guarding the base, who responded with tear gas and drove armoured cars around the perimeter fence. Inside the base, members of the security forces could be seen marching across the Tarmac carrying riot shields and, behind La Carlota, plumes of black smoke rose into the air.Social media was also ablaze with local reports across the country of Venezuelans taking to the streets and of a strong security presence around government buildings.One showed the feared Faes, or special police unit, clashing with protesters in the provincial town of Barquisimeto. Others showed tear gas filling the streets of central Caracas.The day’s pell-mell events started at dawn in a video posted by Mr Guaidó on Twitter in which he said he had started the “final phase” of his campaign to topple Mr Maduro and called on the military to back him and end the “usurpation”. Rocío San Miguel, an expert on Venezuela’s army – which has hitherto remained loyal to Mr Maduro – said it was still too early to tell what kind of support either Mr Guaidó or Mr Maduro could count on from the military’s upper ranks. But there were “no signs of fracture in the important units”, she tweeted.Gen Ornelas was close to Hugo Chávez and took part with him in a failed 1992 coup attempt in which he helped take La Carlota base. He became commander of Chávez’s presidential guard during the past two years of the late president’s life, and was made a major general by Mr Maduro in 2016.However, a mid-morning tweet from Gen Ornelas’s account seemed to counter the notion that he was rebelling. Pledging his “absolute loyalty”, he said the army “would DEFEAT whoever seeks to break the peace of the Republic”.RoadblocksAdding to the confusion, NetBlocks, a non-governmental organisation that monitors cyber security, reported that local social media networks using state-owned telecommunications company CANTV had been partially shut down.Roadblocks set up by forces loyal to Mr Maduro also locked down major traffic thoroughfares.Diosdado Cabello, the powerful number two of the ruling party, described Mr Guaidó and his backers as “traitors” and said they would never set foot inside the Miraflores presidential palace. “Everyone will have to take responsibility for their actions and we will take ours,” he said, speaking to a crowd of red-shirted supporters in central Caracas.Dividing the military has been central to the strategy of the opposition, which is backed by the US and over 50 other countries. But Mr Maduro’s intelligence forces, advised by Cuban security, have kept a tight grip on barrack discipline. Potential coup leaders have been quickly identified and imprisoned even as food shortages and galloping hyperinflation have led to a steady stream of defections by lesser rank and file.On Tuesday, a video of a young soldier wearing a blue bandanna around his face told television reporters that the unrest would continue “until Maduro falls”. But Gen Vladimir Padrino, the defence minister, said all major barracks were calm.Brent crude prices rose more than 1.2 per cent to a high of $73.27 (€65.31) amid investor concerns that Venezuelan producers, already hobbled by unrest and mismanagement, could see output interrupted even further. Many traders already believe global oil supplies are tight due to US sanctions on Iran and pipeline problems in Russia.Foreign supportersThe White House said it was “monitoring the ongoing situation” and that US president Donald Trump had been briefed. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, also tweeted support for Mr Guaidó. But Russia’s foreign ministry said the opposition had “once again turned to violent methods of confrontation”.Moscow has been one of Mr Maduro’s biggest foreign supporters. Russia is owed billions of dollars by his regime and owns a number of oilfields in the country. “We urge that violence be renounced,” the ministry said. “The problems facing Venezuela should be resolved through a responsible negotiation process ... without destructive external interference.”Mexico, which has stood out among Latin American countries by refusing to endorse Mr Guaidó, said it was monitoring developments. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignWhite House planning to designate Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisationGovernment accused of profiting from victims\u0026#39 reporting crime by

Vaccination is the only way to prevent the disease, which is incurable.The campaign to eradicate polio“We know that the last mile has proven to be the toughest phase of polio eradication,” said Dr Michel Zaffran, director of polio eradication at the World Health Organization.“We have yet to stop transmission in some of the most difficult to reach areas of the world, and detection of a single polio case anywhere points to the remaining gaps in vaccination. The report says that further strengthening surveillance systems and community cooperation, which have been central to delivering anti-polio vaccination campaigns, will be key to eradicating the disease before 2023.But the strategy also outlines several new innovations, including the creation of an Afghanistan-Pakistan regional hub to increase cooperation between the two countries, which bear the brunt of the polio disease burden.Just this week, Pakistan decided to halt anti-polio vaccination campaigns after a health worker and two police officers were shot dead. The attack followed the circulation of false claims that the vaccine causes vomiting and fainting on social media – causing near hysteria when 25,000 healthy children were taken to hospital by concerned parents.“Clearly the events in Pakistan are extremely concerning,” said Dr Zaffman. “But while these events have made a lot of impression on the news, the national vaccine campaign was very successful. It was conducted for about a week in Pakistan and covered more than 37 million children across the country.”The strategy presents a road-map to prevent any new new wild polio cases after 2020, which would pave the way for the certified eradication of the disease in 2023. If there continue to be no new cases of wild polio in Nigeria, the disease will be declared eradicated in Africa later this year.However vaccine-derived polio – a rare mutated strain of the disease which was reported in Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018 – persists.Dr Zaffman said the mutated strain of the disease would be eliminated only when vaccines to prevent wild polio are no longer required, as there is no disease reservoir.He also added that while he was confident the strategy could be successful, it is not yet fully funded.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleEnacting the plan would cost roughly $4.2 billion, but GPEI still needs to raise $3.27 billion of this total. The organisation is in the process of writing an investment case and will hold a pledging event in November. “We need to fill that $3.27 billion,” he added. “Now is the time to finish the job and we have all the tools and strategies available to do so.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Pandemics and epidemicsComment: Cambridge\u0026#39s virtue-signalling slavery probe should be greeted with heavy intellectual scepticismCambridge University inquiry into slave trade connections is \u0026#39virtue signalling on steroids\u0026#39, Trevor Phillips saysPeople should not be forced to sell their home to fund social care, suggests Matt HancockBritons will have to more to cut down on climate change, Michael Gove tells activists to help meet targetsWimbledon to reduce plastic use with players\u0026#39 restrung rackets no longer returned in bagsJoseph McCann: \u0026#39Dangerous\u0026#39 criminal suspected of raping and abducting three women remains at largeScouts in election row as leader quits after using boys to deliver Tory leaflets in spirit of \u0026#39Bob-a-Job week\u0026#39Donald Trump sues Deutsche Bank and Capital One in bid to block info going to CongressComment: If we\u0026#39re serious about social mobility then it must be easier for the middle-classes to failBrexit latest news: Theresa May wants talks with Labour to be over by the middle of next weekComment: Brussels beware: Vladimir Putin is plotting to take over the EU Comment: How can the public trust the police, given their paltry presence on the ground?Comment: What is really behind Tom Watson\u0026#39s scheming obsession with a Second Referendum?Far-Right Australian Senate candidate quits after being filmed in a strip clubViolent clashes in Venezuela after opposition leader Juan Guaido calls for military uprisingComment: Change UK held their first anti-Brexit rally... but it felt like a meeting of a book groupNatural England must be held to account, former environment minister says as Gove urged to hold independent shooting inquiryComment: This craven Cabinet must move now to stop the Brexit betrayal, or they will never be forgivenWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/31/16/toysrus.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6165001  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Toys \u0027R\u0027 Us  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/31/16/toysrus.jpg","title":"brexit latest uk business financial distress economy begbies traynor","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

In a highly\u0026nbspcompetitive sector, it\u0027s\u0026nbspthe sort of thing that could drive them out of business. And the improvement certainly isn’t anything to shout about when put in the context of how important the service has become and the impact that the poor performance of broadband providers can have on iniduals and their businesses.\u0026nbspThe regulator has correctly recognised that action is necessary to correct their collective failure.\u0026nbspThe regular publication of the figures is a part of that, but it has also recently taken more concrete steps. \u0026nbspPerhaps its most important reform is the demand that firms automatically compensate customers when they suffer outages or are hit with delays. This also applies if engineers schedule appointments and don’t turn up. Customers are being given more and better information about the speeds they can expect when they sign up, and the power to walk away form contracts if they have a problem.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAll this means that firms that fail to shape up could find themselves facing a significant financial penalty. Bad news for TalkTalk in particular. It again found itself at the bottom of the service league table.Ofcom\u0026nbspalso wants to show its charges a carrot as well as a stick. It hopes that firms scoring more highly will be rewarded with more business.But do people look at Ofcom’s scores and factor them in when choosing a broadband provider? Is there enough differentiation between the firms at the top and those at the bottom to have a meaningful impact on the business they bring in?The figures would suggest otherwise and the industry’s fairly dismal reputation may\u0026nbspserve to put people off switching full stop. Who wants to risk going without broadband for several days, even with the\u0026nbsppromise of compensation if it happens?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

This information can help buyers make the right decision.”A Plusnet spokesperson said: “We’d like to apologise to our customers as we know this isn’t the service they’ve come to expect from us.“We worked with Ofcom to keep them informed and to ensure our customers received the best service through this difficult time.“This report refers to complaints during that time in October to December since then we’ve been working hard to get things back on track and the most recent complaints data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”TalkTalk said: “We’re pleased that Ofcom’s data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk.

They include private chats that the company says it can\u0027t read, in addition to new ways of talking to friends.Facebook\u0027s redesign will help make it an easier way to find groups and other new features of the site, the company said.But it also brings an entirely new look, one of the most dramatic redesigns of how the homepage looks on computers since it was launched. Mark Zuckerberg noted that the app isn\u0027t even blue anymore, which is also true of the website.The Facebook icon has also been changed to make it more lively and modern, Mr Zuckerberg said.As well as the visual redesign, the new website and app\u0027s look also come with a variety of changes underneath, which should allow them to load more quickly and more efficiently.Facebook said the redesign and the focus on groups were part of its mission to become the public square of the internet. But it also acknowledged that it was part of a plan to rescue the company\u0027s reputation from the various problems it has faced in recent weeks.People have always come to Facebook to connect with friends and family, but over time it\u0027s become more than that – it’s also a place to connect with people who share your interests and passions, Facebook said in a release.\u0026nbspToday we’re making changes that put Groups at the center of Facebook and sharing new ways Facebook can help bring people together offline.The change will arrive straight away in the Facebook app, and the new desktop version will come in the next few months, Facebook said.Facebook now has tens of millions of active groups, and more than 400 million people belong to them, it said.Alongside the redesign, Facebook will add a host of new tools aimed at making it easier to be a part of groups.It has an improved discovery tool, that will feature better recommendations, to let people find groups they might be interested in more easily.It will also now be easier to share to those groups, Facebook said. Users will be able to share anything they find directly into groups from the news feed, just like happens now with sharing to friends and family.There will also be a host of new features specifically tailored to members of different kinds of groups. In Health Support groups, for instance, users will be able to ask questions or post information without having their name attached to it job groups will feature new templates to advertise for postings gaming groups will allow people to chat within the group itself and buy and sell groups will let people more easily ask questions and buy things.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it could eventually roll out to all users, leaving them unable to see how many likes their posts get.People will still be able to see when someone likes their posts, and clicking through will show everyone who has done so. But the only way to find out how many of them there are would be manually counting up, since Instagram will no longer show the big number next to the post.“Later this week, we’re running a test in Canada that removes the total number of likes on photos and video views in Feed, Permalink pages and Profile,” an Instagram spokesperson told\u0026nbspTechCrunch, which first reported the news. “We are testing this because we want your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get.Many influencers and other people who are paid to post on Facebook use the like metric as an important way of understanding how popular and engaging a post is. Those numbers can then affect how much brands will pay them to post, making likes an important number for those users.Facebook quietly announces exposure of millions of Instagram passwordsInstagram said it was aware that hiding the likes could therefore be financially difficult for many Instagram users. It told Techcrunch it was thinking through ways for them to communicate value to their brand partners and that the idea was still in its exploratory stages.As anxiety about the damage social media is doing to people\u0027s mental health and wellbeing has spread, the idea of removing some of the more obvious and competitive markers of a person\u0027s popularity has spread. The idea has gathered support from people including Kanye West, who last year sent a flurry of posts about the damage that like counters were doing to social media users.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The huge blast it created as it entered injured more than 1,500 people, and damaged over 7,000 buildings.Statistically, meteor events of that size happen once every 60 years, but Bridenstine pointed out there have been three such incidents over the last 100 years.Chelyabinsk in 2013 (AP PhotoChelyabinsk.ru)On the very same day as the Chelyabinsk Event, another, even larger asteroid, measuring 100 feet across and known as “Duende” passed the Earth.“We are fortunate that it missed,” Mr Bridenstine said. It is forecast to fly past Earth again in 2123.“We have to use our systems, use our capabilities to ultimately get a lot more data, and we have to do it faster,” he added.“We know for a fact that the dinosaurs did not have a space programme. But we do, and we need to use it.”Nasa has been directed by the US government to detect and track 90 per cent of near-Earth objects 460 feet or larger. But there are an estimated 25,000 objects in this category, and the agency has only catalogued about one third of them to date. First ever ‘Marsquake’ detected by Nasa InSight lander‘Strange blue lights’ spotted over Arctic Circle explained by NasaHuge meteor explosion above Earth’s surface detected by NasaMeteor explosion over Bristol caught on camera by astronomerMr Bridenstine said tackling large asteroids which posed a threat to Earth required more resources and more countries needed to work to build more powerful rockets like Nasa’s Space Launch System, which will be the most powerful rocket it has ever built. He said this was necessary “so that ultimately, when discoveries are made, and risk needs to be mitigated, we have more options than we would otherwise have.” The Space Launch system is to be used for the next manned mission to the Moon in 2024. Nasa is also working on a joint project with Elon Musk’s Space X company to test their ability to deflect threatening meteors.The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) will send a rocket to collide with a near-Earth asteroid in an attempt to change its path.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shockingly, Iran also banned the film over its perceived support of gay rights.Claire Danes\u0027 honesty regarding her time working in Manila came with a  price. After telling Premiere Magazine the country smelled like cockroaches, the council passed a motion to ban the Homeland star from the city and prevent her films from being shown. Although Danes issued an apology, Manila said they will lift the ban when they are satisfied.When attempting to explain why the film has remained such a favourite over the decades, he referenced a line from the film itself: “There is a fine line between stupid and clever and, hopefully, we hit\u0026nbspit.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This information can help buyers make the right decision.”A Plusnet spokesperson said: “We’d like to apologise to our customers as we know this isn’t the service they’ve come to expect from us.“We worked with Ofcom to keep them informed and to ensure our customers received the best service through this difficult time.“This report refers to complaints during that time in October to December since then we’ve been working hard to get things back on track and the most recent complaints data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”TalkTalk said: “We’re pleased that Ofcom’s data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk.

It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard’s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero.The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who’d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn\u0027t one of them.Courtesy of BFINicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history.

Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest.1047 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)It wouldn’t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy. It was ironically  thanks to Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood whose career flourished after starring in this Sergio Leone film that many consider to be the genre’s peak.Mathieu Kassovitz’s black-and-white drama – translated in English as Hate – follows three young friends and their struggles living in the suburbs of Paris.The Academy may not be frothing at the mouth to nominate horror films, but do have previous (see: The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lamb), which makes the absence of John Carpenter’s influential Halloween a glaring oversight.1347 Harold and Maude (1971)This offbeat romantic drama was a critical and commercial flop at the time of release, which probably accounts for its lack of Oscar nominations. Today, though, it’s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans.On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested.Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination.While falling short of Christopher Nolan’s best,  modest drama Insomnia – made years before Batman Begins – had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations. Alas, it received none.Bill Forsyth’s beloved comedy-drama follows the mishaps of an American man sent to buy up a Scottish village where the oil company he works for wants to build a refinery. Forsyth won the Bafta for Best Director, but the film received no such love from the Academy.You’d be mistaken for thinking the “M” stands for “masterpiece” in Fritz Lang’s German drama that follows the manhunt for a serial killer - not that the Academy agreed.Robert Bresson’s adaptation of André Devigny’s memoirs charts the French Resistance member’s time as prisoner of the Germans during World War II, and is even more enthralling considering Bresson himself was held captive years before.Kenneth Lonergan would go on to win an Oscar for Manchester but he Sea, but Margaret - his three-hour plus drama featuring a searing performance from Anna Paquin - failed to secure a single nomination.2147 In the Mood for Love (2000)Wong Kar-wai set the benchmark for romance in film with his acclaimed Hong Kong drama following a man and woman (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) who develop feelings for one another after suspecting their respective spouses of having an affair together.2247 The King of Comedy (1982)It may have taken him decades to win an Oscar, but the Academy has rarely balked at nominating Martin Scorsese films – especially for films starring Robert De Niro.

The director would go on to win a belated Oscar for The Departed in 2007, but he’d have to wait until 1975 for his first nomination (Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore).No Lars von Trier film has ever been nominated for Best Picture, though Dancer in the Dark came close (it settled for a Best Original Song nomination). He came close with Melancholia, but ultimately, the drama didn\u0027t getDespite being revered as a Coen brothers favourite, not to mention its notable performances from Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, Miller’s Crossing is one of few Coen brother films not to receive a single Oscar nomination. 2947 Once Upon a Time in America (1984)Though it\u0027s by no means a masterpiece, it’s staggering to think that Sergio Leone’s gangster epic - starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci - didn’t acquire any Oscar nominations (the film\u0027s music was disqualified from consideration after Warner Bros accidentally omitted the composer\u0027s name from the opening credits when trimming the film’s lengthy running time for its American release).Critics assumed Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson would have been a shoo-in for awards recognition - most notably in the Best Actor category, thanks to a quietly fantastic performance from Adam Driver - but no such luck.3147 Paths of Glory (1957)Stanley Kubrick never won Best Director despite being nominated four times. One of his films that didn’t make the Oscars cut in any category was his black-and-white anti-war film, Paths of Glory.3247 Play Misty for Me (1971)Clint Eastwood would go onto become something of an Oscar darling thanks to Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, but his directorial debut was ignored by the Academy.Univeral PicturesCourtesy of Getty ImagesReservoir Dogs may not touch Quentin Tarantino’s best, but it remains a surprise that the filmmaker’s debut didn’t get recognised in the screenplay category, at least.Of all the 2018 films to be snubbed at this year’s Oscars, Chloé Zhao’s drama - which stars a real-life rodeo cowboy and his family - smacks as the most unfair.The role of Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards might be considered John Wayne’s best role, but the Academy didn’t agree: he would win his sole Oscar for True Grit in 1970.Another Kubrick film that was completely ignored by the Academy is the director’s Stephen King adaptation, The Shining. Today, it’s considered one of his finest works as well as being one of the most revered horror films of all time.3747 The Shop Around the Corner (1953)It may have endured as one of the best loved romcoms of all time, but it has zero Oscar nominations to its name.Japanese director Hirokazo Kore-eda\u0027s portrait of a family over roughly 24 hours as they commemorate the death of the eldest son was a glaring oversight by the Academy.Before he became Disney\u0027s go to, Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book and the forthcoming live-action Lion King) wrote this independent film about the lives of single, unemployed actors living in Hollywood, California during the 1990s swing revival.The 2007 ceremony would have been far better had Shane Meadows\u0027 coming-of-drama been in contention for awards.The Academy deemed Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle worthy of nominations, but not David O Russell’s Three Kings, which remains one of his greatest films to this day.Tokyo Story is deemed Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu\u0027s masterpiece and was named Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s best film of all time in 2012.4347 Touch of Evil (1958)Orson Welles\u0027 classic noir wasn\u0027t as well loved at the time of release as it is today.Olivia Colman may be in contention for Best Actress at this year’s ceremony, but the fact she failed to earn a nomination (or Bafta, for that matter) for her role in Paddy Considine’s hard-hitting drama Tyrannosaur is one of the biggest oversights in awards history.Another exceptional achievement in filmmaking from Nicolas Roeg that somehow failed to receive any Oscar nominations.Notch it down to bad timing, but Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here - starring Joaquin Phoenix - is a sensational piece of work worthy of reward.Three years later, David Fincher would go head-to-head with The King Speech\u0027s Tom Hooper for The Social Network.

One of his films that didn’t make the Oscars cut in any category was his black-and-white anti-war film, Paths of Glory.3247 Play Misty for Me (1971)Clint Eastwood would go onto become something of an Oscar darling thanks to Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, but his directorial debut was ignored by the Academy.Univeral PicturesCourtesy of Getty ImagesReservoir Dogs may not touch Quentin Tarantino’s best, but it remains a surprise that the filmmaker’s debut didn’t get recognised in the screenplay category, at least.Of all the 2018 films to be snubbed at this year’s Oscars, Chloé Zhao’s drama - which stars a real-life rodeo cowboy and his family - smacks as the most unfair.The role of Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards might be considered John Wayne’s best role, but the Academy didn’t agree: he would win his sole Oscar for True Grit in 1970.Another Kubrick film that was completely ignored by the Academy is the director’s Stephen King adaptation, The Shining. Today, it’s considered one of his finest works as well as being one of the most revered horror films of all time.3747 The Shop Around the Corner (1953)It may have endured as one of the best loved romcoms of all time, but it has zero Oscar nominations to its name.Japanese director Hirokazo Kore-eda\u0027s portrait of a family over roughly 24 hours as they commemorate the death of the eldest son was a glaring oversight by the Academy.Before he became Disney\u0027s go to, Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book and the forthcoming live-action Lion King) wrote this independent film about the lives of single, unemployed actors living in Hollywood, California during the 1990s swing revival.The 2007 ceremony would have been far better had Shane Meadows\u0027 coming-of-drama been in contention for awards.The Academy deemed Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle worthy of nominations, but not David O Russell’s Three Kings, which remains one of his greatest films to this day.Tokyo Story is deemed Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu\u0027s masterpiece and was named Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s best film of all time in 2012.4347 Touch of Evil (1958)Orson Welles\u0027 classic noir wasn\u0027t as well loved at the time of release as it is today.Olivia Colman may be in contention for Best Actress at this year’s ceremony, but the fact she failed to earn a nomination (or Bafta, for that matter) for her role in Paddy Considine’s hard-hitting drama Tyrannosaur is one of the biggest oversights in awards history.Another exceptional achievement in filmmaking from Nicolas Roeg that somehow failed to receive any Oscar nominations.Notch it down to bad timing, but Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here - starring Joaquin Phoenix - is a sensational piece of work worthy of reward.Three years later, David Fincher would go head-to-head with The King Speech\u0027s Tom Hooper for The Social Network. In truth, serial killer drama Zodiac is every bit as good as the Facebook drama.She said: “I believe that it’s an amazing story to tell. Everyone who sees the film agrees that we have to do honour to the man himself.

Ian Murray, a former shadow Scottish secretary, said backing for a Final Say referendum had been “upheld at last”.“Given there won’t be a general election and the Tories will not agree customs union and single market, the @UKLabour EU manifesto commits to a public vote,” he tweeted.May to abandon Brexit talks with Labour if no deal by next weekBen Bradshaw, a leading pro-referendum Labour MP, echoed the message, tweeting: “There won’t be an election cos Tory MPs won’t vote for one. #peoplesvote only thing left. Bingo!”Labour’s pro-EU wing was also pleased that the party would now have to rapidly rewrite the controversial European election leaflet which made no mention of a fresh referendum.Mr Corbyn’s office had been confident of resisting a shift to supporting a further referendum in all circumstances, enjoying the support of at least 22 of the 39 members of the NEC.He could rely on the backing of the giant Unite union, despite other big unions – including the GMB, Unison and Usdaw – swinging behind another public vote.Change UK urges pro-EU Labour members to \u0027lend\u0027 them supportWhy has May set a deadline for a Brexit deal compromise with Labour?Corbyn’s taste for Brexit fudge leaves us facing a national traumaTop Brexit Party candidate condemned for past defence of IRA bombingBut more than 20 Labour MEP candidates had defied their leadership by pledging to back a referendum and then campaign to remain in the EU.And a letter from MPs and MEPs calling for a public vote on any Brexit deal has reached 118 signatories, meaning the majority of non-shadow cabinet MPs back it.Earlier, Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, walked out of a shadow cabinet meeting after Mr Corbyn refused to allow its members to see the draft referendum policy, ahead of the NEC gathering.Following the meeting, a Labour source said: “The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour’s existing policy to support Labour’s alternative plan, and if we can’t get the necessary changes to the government’s deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don’t sponsor a particular point of view or finding.”The tweet’s popularity was partly driven by online commenters wondering whether the post was a joke.“Is this some prank?”\u0026nbspSmita\u0026nbspBarooah, a Twitter user, asked.Yeti mystery finally solved by scientists“Maybe something out of the box to draw attention to their expedition?”“This is deeply, deeply embarrassing,” Praveen\u0026nbspSwami, group consulting editor at Indian media company Network18, wrote.“Whoever in the Indian army’s PR has circulated this is disgracing the institution, and India, in the world’s eyes.”A politician from the ruling Bharatiya Janata\u0026nbspParty (BJP) was also mocked for asking the army\u0026nbspto stop\u0026nbspcalling the yeti a “beast”.Tarun Vijay asked the army to use more respectful language.“Congratulations, we are always proud of you,” he\u0026nbspwrote, in response to the organisation’s Twitter post.“But please, you are Indian, don’t call yeti as beast. Show respect for them...he is a ‘snowman’.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The party is polling around 10 per cent to 12 per cent for the European elections next month, slightly down on its other scores.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Salvini was tagged in the post.\u0026nbspThe viral image was widely shared after Italian activist Marco Furfaro posted it on Facebook alongside the caption: “Caltanissetta protesters. Love beats hate 3-0. Trolling Salvini to the extreme. You rock Gaia and Matilde.”The hashtag #GaiaeMatilde – the names of the two young women in the photo – has gained traction on Twitter.Gaia can be seen appearing to attempt to take another photo kissing her friend after taking the first one but a security agent appears to swiftly place their hand in the way in order to separate the two young women.“The hand of another friend that ides,” says the caption of an image which can be seen on her Instagram Stories.Mr Salvini has been mocked in the wake of the image – with an influx of memes\u0026nbsppoking fun at the expression on his face. Others have hailed the women’s “brave” and “glorious” protest.“When the minister urged those present to take the stage and take a selfie with him, we had this idea because he participated in World Congress of Families as a minister,” Gaia, who has only been identified by her first name, told Euronews.\u0026nbsp“We made a provocative instinctive gesture, not at all premeditated. On stage, Salvini did not expect us to take a picture like this. When we kissed, an agent I think, separated us sharply and Salvini then told us ‘I wish you luck’ so we took off thanking him ironically.”Campaigners argue women’s rights are being rolled back\u0026nbspunder Mr Salvini and\u0026nbsptraditional stereotypes about the role of women are also worsening.The political leader was fiercely criticised after neither he nor any Minister from the League chose to attend national celebrations which sees Italy mark\u0026nbspthe liberation from fascism on 25 April each year.Campaigners protest against \u0027medieval\u0027 anti-abortion summit in ItalyLast week, Italian media documented neo-fascist demonstrations, desecrations of memorials of participants of the Italian resistance against fascism, and drawings of swastikas across the country. Some 30 people held a banner reading “Honour to Benito Mussolini” while performing fascist salutes in Milan.A day later, a garland commemorating a partisan who fought fascism in WW2 was burned down in Milan. Other memorials were desecrated across the country.The League, which supports far right and anti-immigration policies, formed a government coalition with the Five Star Movement in June 2018, after it won about 17 per cent of the vote in a general election.

Idealistic young voters are all ears.There is a solution to our looming energy crisis — cheap, clean shale gas. But feeble Energy Secretary Greg Clark threw it away, forcing fracking tsar Natascha Engel to quit yesterday in disgust.After nine dithering years in power, with no idea how to keep the lights on, this Government is damned now whichever way it jumps.Protesters claiming “The End Is Nigh” are swarming like angry wasps.Their claims may be simplistic and sometimes , but they have been nailed on Netflix by national treasure Sir David Attenborough and hammered home by Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg.Jezza is using these crowd-pullers to turn dull carbon emissions into a glittering crusade — a national emergency no less.His Momentum Marxists are tutoring the Extinction Rebellion protesters who gridlocked London and turned -year-old Greta into a global warming superstar. The Tories have nothing to say.Gutless Clark abandoned fracking contractors who risked hundreds of million only to see Project Shale strangled at birth.Engel’s walk-out should surprise nobody. I received a frantic call from the ex-Labour MP weeks ago warning about “nonsense” rules which stop fracking at the slightest tremor.She told me: “This is a real threat to the industry and means buying more Russian gas.” Her argument doesn’t wash with Jezza’s anti-capitalist anarchists, Greta or Blue Planet’s Sir David, who between them now run UK energy policy.Arguments for shale have been drowned out by images of raging bushfires, tidal waves and an Apocalypse Now soundtrack.Saint David’s bell tolls, and it tolls for the Tories.Climate change is the issue of the day. They have thrown in the towel on this as on so much .Greta Thunberg is Sweden’s new dancing queen, upstaging gas-guzzling hypocrite Emma Thompson and treating Britain’s top ministers with withering sarcasm.They were doing NOTHING to reduce carbon emissions, she spat. In truth, Britain is leading Europe, at huge cost, in reducing carbon emissions while replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy. Wind and solar energy are replacing coal.It is also a fact, courtesy of the respected Intergovern- mental Panel On Climate Change, that global warming is not about to roast us all alive or drown us beneath stormy oceans.Polar bears are multiplying, not disappearing. Walruses are thriving, not throwing themselves off rocks.None of this washes with single-issue, black-and-white zealots who regard all inconvenient truth as the work of the Devil. I am no climate change denier. We are polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.If I ruled the world, Russia, China, India and America would not turn oceans and rivers into chemical sewers.I would ban plastic dumping, save sea le from being choked or poisoned and halt deforestation and desert- ication. But I don’t rule the world, and nor does Saint David or Greta Thunberg — or the hundreds of, let’s say, well-intentioned young folk who think paralysing London is the next best thing.Britain deserves credit for cutting carbon emissions further and faster than most EU countries.Temperatures are rising, but not by Extinction Rebellion or Miss Thunberg’s worst-case projections.Evangelical followers want an end to air travel except when they go skiing.Everything must come by sea even though shipping is a highly polluting form of transport.We must grow our own food, putting farmers in poor countries out of a job and workers here on the dole.WARREN BUFFETT, the legendary Sage of Omaha, has amassed billions putting his money where his mouth is.He thinks Britain, with its rule of law and decent, hard-working citizens is the world’s best place to invest, regardless of Brexit.He’s not alone. Once Brexit is settled, a wall of money will be unleashed by firms at home and abroad who have been sitting on the fence for three years.There is only one fly in the ointment – the prospect of anti-Semitic, US-hating, terrorist-backing Jeremy Corbyn as our next PM.Jezza’s much brighter brother Piers deserves a final say on this sudden burst of mass hysteria and Greta worship.“Listening to an ignorant, brainwashed child is deranged,” he tweets. “I am an actual scientist of physics, meteorology, astrophysics and climate and say Greta Thunberg is wrong.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It could also hand Britain an economic boom, and reduce our dependence on energy imports from far-flung dictatorships.Cowardly Business Secretary Greg Clark is squandering this windfall by giving in to the green lobby. As Engel says — listen to the science, not just to those who shout the loudest.At least the Tories aren’t quite as bad as Jeremy Corbyn, who would ban fracking altogether and destroy hundreds of jobs in the process.It is time the Government ignored leftie posturing and turned on the shale gas taps.THE five thugs suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence have repeatedly dodged justice. So it’s an outrage they’ve been allowed to run up nearly £million in legal aid — funded, of course, by the taxpayer.Gary Dobson and David Norris lied for  years before finally being convicted of murder, while the other three have always refused to explain their role in the racist attack on Stephen.Of course every suspect has the right to a defence, but it can’t be fair that such sums have been lavished on lawyers for these fundamentally dishonest men.Contrast this state-funded generosity with the treatment of Stephen’s grieving parents, who were denied legal aid when trying to get justice for their son.Coming hot on the heels of Shamima Begum’s legal aid windfall, this is fresh proof the system isn’t working. Legal aid is meant to ensure the right to a fair trial, not help killers avoid being held to account.LEEDS United boss Marcelo Bielsa has restored faith in modern football.His players were wrong to score against Aston Villa while their opponents had a man down injured, but he immediately put it right by gting Villa an equaliser.You could see on Bielsa’s face how much it hurt. The gesture was the final nail in the coffin for Leeds’ automatic promotion challenge — and an incredible example for footie-mad kids who need to know the importance of fair play.In an era where sport stars hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, it’s heart-warming to see a team go about things the right way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As Kate and Gerry face the agonising th anniversary of their daughter’s abduction in just three days, the Facebook page promoting the hunt for Madeleine is appealing to the public to ignore  snaps and view only the official images previously released by experts.A close friend of the McCanns from Rothley, Leicestershire, urges: We have received questions about a new age-progression image that was circulated on Instagram. This image was not commissioned by nor endorsed by Gerry and Kate or Operation Grange.Any other accounts sharing age-progression images are not from us or Operation Grange. Thank you for helping in the search for Madeleine.They share links to their official social media accounts, hoping real images could prove the key to helping solving the world’s biggest ever missing child mysteries.Former GP Kate, , and eminent heart doctor Gerry, , have suffered a recent torrent of abuse in the wake of streaming giant Netflix’s newly-released documentary re-examining the facts of Madeleines disappearance from a holiday apartment Portugal’s Praia da Luz in May .Trolls have targeted them after the programme aired  claims from former Portuguese police officers that they were involved in their eldest child’s accidental death and faked her kidnap.Supporters of the McCanns slammed the new pictures as shameless and so wrong.A year ago the McCanns were urged to have new age progression pictures created to show how their daughter - who would now be  - may have changed in adolescence.Experts in America warned she could be “unrecognisable” from the last computer-generated image released of her as a girl of nine in May  - seven years ago.US forensic scientists suggest pictures of missing kids should be produced every two years.But so far Kate and Gerry have hesitated in taking up their advice because the procedure is y, costly and emotionally draining, their spokesperson Clarence Mitchell previously revealed.Scotland Yard are still chasing a final line or two of inquiry into Madeleines disappearance with a new government cash boost believed to be as much as £, set to be approved. But cops have not yet been pushing the McCanns to update Madeleine photo in a last-ditch bid to help find her.A family friend said: “If and when the politan Police advise Kate and Gerry that new images of Madeleine as a mid-teenager could aid their investigation they will strongly consider going through the process again.They’ve been reminded by experts in the US that new pictures really should be drawn up. If she’s out there, and her family hope and pray she is, there’s a chance she could have changed so much from the last image put out six years ago.Madeleine is remembered around the globe as an angel-faced fair-haired toddler wearing a scarlet dress in an iconic picture. It was a favourite snap first released to the media by her frantic parents when she vanished from The Algarve’s Praia da Luz in May .They also shared the last-ever known photo of their daughter clutching tennis balls during a lesson on court on her doomed family holiday .Mr Mitchell said: Those two picture of Madeleine are etched on everyone’s minds. Some people are still searching for that cute little girl dressed in red or with her arms wrapped around tennis balls. At times whenever there are potential sightings they are conjured up of a young Madeleine. It’s astime’s stood still.Seven years on from the last computer generated image of her created by FBI experts in America and first unveiled by the politan Police in London she could still look dferent.Mr Mitchell added: Twelve years is a long time when a child goes from being a toddler to a mid teenager and her features could have changed.The only real tell tale sign is the distinctive blemish in her right eye.Kate and Gerry will heed the advise of the police, who they remain extremely grateful to, and will consider new imagesneeded. No one ever thought she would be missing for so long."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000486391991.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"indian army yeti himalayas twitter","story":"The Indian Army tweeted it had discovered mysterious footprints ofmythical beast at the Makalu Base Camp.Later army mountaineers shared pictures of footprints in the snow on its official Twitter account - which has nearly six million followers.The post read: For the first time, an Indian Army mountaineering expedition team has sitedmysterious footprints of mythical beast Yeti.The words were posted alongside three photos of footprints, and a group picture that appeared to be of a military expedition group.The prints allegedly measured  inches by  inchesand were found an isolated mountainous area between Nepal and Tibet.This elusive snowman has only been sighted at Makalu-Barun National Park in the past, the post claimed.It prompted a flurry of hilarious responses on social media, with many slamming the military for the post.Their existence has been never been proven, but they have captured the imagination of many, including naturalist Sir David Attenborough.The Yeti became part of local traditions  years ago, when a holy man named took up residence in a cave near which had a clear view of Everest.According to local folklore, he was said to have been aided by Yetis and to have kept relics from the mythical beasts.In , a journalist named Henry Newman interviewed a group of Brit explorers who had just ed from a Mount Everest expedition.They told hime they had discovered some very large footprints which guides had attributed to metoh-kangmi, meaning man-bear snow-man.Yeti fever really took off after Brit explorer Eric Shipton took a photonear Everest in  of what appeared to be a large primate-like footprint.Since then there have been numerous instances of people, explorers, scientists claiming to have either sighted Yeti or spotted its footprints.The Yeti is said to be muscular, covered with dark grayish or reddish-brown hair, and weigh between  and  lbs.It is relatively short compared to North Americas Bigfoot, averaging about  feetin height.Some pointed out the footprints seemed to be in a straight line joking the Yeti must only have one leg then.Others also poked fun at the tweet and the hashtag #Yeti is now one of the top Twitter trending topics in India.The Indian Army provided no further evidence of its find about the Abominable Snowman for about ten days but then decided that they matched earlier theories.“So we thought it prudentto excite scientic temper and rekindle the interest, the Army said.There have been numerous attempts over the past few decades to solve the mystery of the Yeti.In , DNA tests on a Yeti finger taken from Nepal to London half a century ago found it to be human bone.And in , tests on hair samples carried out by Oxford University genetics professor Bryan Sykes found that they matched those from an ancient polar bear.He said the most likely explanation for the myth is that the animal is a hybrid of polar bears and brown bears.On March , the Indian Army said an -strong unit would make its its maiden expedition to Mount Makalu between March and May.The unit was heading there as part of its objective of reaching the summit of all challenging peaks above , meters , the statement said.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The formal notication comes a week after activists passed the threshold to trigger the meeting.Leave-backers - who are furious with Mrs Mayaposs decision to delay Brexit to October  and enter apossoft dealapos talks with Labour - had been pushing for the meeting so they can stage a vote of no confidence in the Tory leader.They used rules which say the National Conservative Convention must call an EGMat least  chairman of local constituency associations demand one in a petition.That threshold was passed over Easter, with activists handing in a petition with more than  chairmanaposs signatures to the Convention secretary. While not legally binding, a no confidence vote at the Convention would heap political pressure on Mrs May to quit her post within weeks.Petition organiser Dinah Glover, who chairs London East Area Conservatives, told the Mirror last week: The longer Mrs May stays in No, the more Brexit is under threat.Such a move by grassroots Tories is said to be unprecedented in the partyaposs -year history. While non-binding, losing the vote would put huge pressure on Mrs May to step down. Talks between senior Tory minsters and Labour figures are continuing, ostensibly to break the Commons impasse over Brexit.However, Mrs Mayaposs handling of Brexit, along with discussions with Labour, has enraged Tory activists and translated into problems for the party on the doorstep.  Mrs May was reportedly made aware of the news personally on Monday night by the head of the National Conservative Convention Andrew Sharpe, who is also a deputy party chairman. The petition states that the signatories no longer feel that Mrs May is the right person to continue as Prime Minister to lead us forward in the negotiations. We therefore with great reluctance ask that she considers her position and resigns, it adds. Mrs May has already survived an internal attempt to oust her when backbenchers on the partyaposs  Committee launched a revolt in December. Under party rules, disgruntled MPs have to wait  months from a failed bid to try again in a fresh vote. Bids to shorten that period to six months have so far fallen flat. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned today against any attempt to get rid of Mrs May before a Brexit deal is passed by MPs. He told the Daily : The process of a Tory leadership election would inevitably involve candidates setting out their red lines which might itself mean that finding a compromise to get Brexit over the line becomes harder.

Only this time itaposs from a nondescript room in Labouraposs Westminster HQ where  party officials have been thrashing out a Brexit policy. Labour chiefs today agreed what the party will say about a second referendum in the May  EU elections. Labour WILL back a second referendum - but onlyit canapost get a general election or changes to Theresa Mayaposs deal. It was subject to a huge row in the run-up to the decision, with Tom Watson, who wanted Labour to go further, walking out of a meeting. Now that itaposs over, everyone is trying to claim victory. So what has actually been agreed and what does it mean  Hereaposs a quick guide.  Labour has agreed its Brexit manesto pledge for the European Parliament elections on May . The carefully-formed wording was signed off by the partyaposs -member ruling National Executive Committeeat a gruelling five-hour meeting today.The manesto will say Labour backs the option of a second referendum on Brexit - but only in certain circumstances. These areLabour canapost get a general election or canapost get the necessary changes to Theresa May ’s Brexit deal.Otherwise, Labour is still pushing ahead with its own Brexit plan. And talks with the Tory government about a compromise Brexit plan are continuing. Why is there a party row Remain figures, including deputy leader Tom Watson, wanted to go much further - by demanding a public vote onanyBrexit deal that is agreed.Under their plan, any deal would have been put to a confirmatory referendum letting the public choose between that deal and Remain. Pro-EU Labour backers sent more than , e-mails to the NEC urging them to back a confirmatory vote on any deal. The Unison, GMB and Usdaw unions - who all have NEC reps - also demanded the manesto included the policy, as did key members of the pro-Corbyn group Momentum. And more than  MPs and MEPs demanded it too. Who aposwonapos today  Allies of Jeremy Corbyn won a victory by ensuring the more nuanced wording went into the manesto. According to reports, Remain-backers on the NEC - led by the TSSA union - tried to pass an amendment that would have committed to a referendum onanyBrexit deal.But it was easily defeated, according to reports. The agreed plan means there will not be a public vote under all circumstances. Thataposs been branded a fudge by some Remainers and leaves much more wriggle room later on. However, it also acknowledges fears that becoming the aposreferendumapos or aposRemainapos party would alienate voters in Labouraposs northern heartlands. So why are Remain MPs claiming victory   Despite apparently losing the day, Remain MPs celebrated. Thataposs because they believe the necessary changes to Theresa Mayaposs deal wonapost be achieved - because talks with Labour have been grinding on for weeks. And that means in the end, Labour will be forced to back a public vote. A Remain-backing Labour MP told the Mirror: I can’t see how they will get the necessary changes. And in any case, the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs will not back a deal without a confirmatory vote attached. Simple as that. Numbers haven’t changed. Labour Remainer Ian Murray added: Given there wonapost be a general election and the Tories will agree customs union and single market, the manesto commits to a public vote. Theyaposre also relieved that the words public vote will appear in a Labour manesto - which, after all, is a big sht from the partyaposs stance a year ago. Labour Remainer Wes Streeting said the NEC had made the right call and confirmed that a public vote will be in our manesto. So... this means all things to all people   Yes. Compare the Remainersapos claims to Gloria De Piero, who represents a Leave seat. She said the manesto will not contain a pledge to hold a second referendum.Or Labouraposs many hard Remain enemies, like Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP leader said: Labour is a Brexit supporting party.Even second referendum campaigns Best For Britain and People’s Vote couldnapost agree whether Labour’s policy was a good thing. Best For Britain’s Naomi Smith said Labour has “come a long way” and is keeping second referendum as an option. But Labour MP Bridget Phillipson of People’s Vote said Labour has done the “bare minimum” with a “mealy-mouthed” manesto pledge. “Labour risks demoralising activists, depressing turnout among supporters and decreasing the share of the vote for candidates who - like the overwhelming majority of our party - are fighting for a People’s Vote on any Brexit deal,” she said. How does this relate to the conference policy   This all unfolded the way it did because of another careful bit of wording - agreed six months ago at Labouraposs party conference in Liverpool. Back then, Labour agreed:If we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote. If the Government is confident in negotiation a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.Youaposll notice todayaposs wording is a bit dferent, because it makes specic reference to getting necessary changes to the governmentaposs deal. So itaposs very much in the spirit of the conference policy, but moves it on and makes it a bit more specic. What does it mean for the EU elections  Labouraposs enemies on both sides will try and paint todayaposs decision in the worst possible light. Remain parties will say Labour is backing Brexit and Brexit parties will say the party is moving towards a second referendum. Both will have the benefit of being, at least partly, true. Today’s decision leaves the possibility that Labour MEP candidates could break ranks from the official aposparty lineapos in the EU election campiagn. By this morning  of Labouraposs  MEP candidates had signed a pledge to campaign for a referendum, then back efforts to remain in the EU.

Since last summer, the Charlestown hopeful has iously urged others to prepare for ‘religious war’ called for white people to unite against ‘the one and only enemy…Islam’ and has argued that white people are the only ‘true’ Europeans. Mr Kagouras stood for the Conservatives in Cheetham last year, as well as in Miles Platting and Newton Heath in  and , then under the first name Harry. This year, he was selected to stand in Charlestown on May .  After the M.E.N. highlighted his social media history, the party today said he had been dropped as its candidate and called his posts aposunacceptableapos. Mr Kagouras strenuously denies being Islamaphobic. He said he has Muslim friends and merely opposes Islamic terrorism, adding that his tweets have been misunderstood because English is his second language. His posts, which have surfaced just two days before Thursdayaposs elections, will be particularly embarrassing for the Conservative Party as it battles allegations of institutional Islamaphobia as a result of racist online comments by party members. An M.E.N. analysis of Mr Kagourasaposs social media accounts shows repeated racist posts going back years, mostly directed at Muslims. On April , in reply to a story about ISIS fighter Shamima Begum, he wrote: “Iaposve been in Manchester since the s every year itaposs worse and worse. Now we have - no go areas, the P**i mile, and Cheetham Hill.”  A few weeks earlier, shortly before local election nominations had closed, he complained that Muslim preachers were playing ‘ISIS’ music on Market Street. On New Year’s Eve, months before being selected again by the party, he wrote in response to a post about Syrians living in Germany: “We allow it to happen. Now it is too late. We must prepare for religious war.” A few weeks before that, in reply to a story about German schools teaching children about headscarves, he wrote: How about teach the f*** [sic] Muslims how to get the f*** out of Europe before getting kicked out.In October, he tweeted that ‘by throwing out the white Europeans and the British whites not procreating you’re losing the battle against Islam’, adding that Brexit has ‘turned the British whites against the European whites’, rather than ‘against the one and only enemy… the Islam’.A month earlier, he said Europe should be given ‘back to the white people’, who he added were the ‘true and olny [sic] Europeans’.In August, he said Muslims were ‘murders’ [sic], while in November , he wrote: “This is Britain. F*** Muslims, and their mosques. Confiscate their British passports. Non [sic] of them is worthy of them send them back starting from the mayor of London, assumed to be a reference to Sadiq Khan . At around the same time, he complained on Twitter that he had been ‘banned’ from Facebook ‘for saying my opinion out loud’. He does still have an active Facebook page, however, which includes posts confirming his previous Conservative candidacy for Miles Platting and Newton Heath, at that time under the name Harry Kagouris.On Facebook a few weeks ago, he posted a picture of Adolf Hitler with Jeremy Corbyn ’s face superimposed on it, alongside a list of ways he claims the two are politically and personally alike.Mr Kagouras came eighth out of eight candidates in Cheetham during last year’s all-out local elections, polling .pc of the vote for the Tories. In  he came second in Miles Platting and Newton Heath with pc of the vote. A year earlier, when the Conservatives won the general election, he polled pc in the same ward. The Tories have been under growing pressure in recent weeks to tackle what Conservative Muslim peer Baroness Sayeeda Warsi called aposinstitutional racismapos in March, following the suspension of  members over offensive social media posts.  After being contacted by the M.E.N, a Conservative Party spokesman said the party had dropped Mr Kagouris, but added he would still have to be listed as a Tory on the ballot paper due to the last-minute nature of the decision. “Nominations for local government candidates have closed. Electoral law dictates that after the deadline has passed candidates cannot be removed from the ballot or their details changed, he said. However, Mr Kagouras is no longer a Conservative Party candidate and would not be allowed to join the Conservative groupelected. The Conservative Party does not tolerate any form of racism or discrimination and language such as this is totally unacceptable.” Mr Kagouras deleted his Twitter page soon after being contacted by the M.E.N.  Asked about his social media posts and the party’s decision, Mr Kagouris, who is originally from Greece, said in a message: “I am NOT Islamophobic. I have Muslim friends. “My country was occupied by the Ottoman Empire for  years and the new Turkish government murdered a million Greeks. “What I opposed is Islamist terrorism like ISIS, because my written English is NOT good some of my social media can be taken the wrong way.                                              “Iaposve been accused of homophobia, thataposs NOT true.

The pair are campaigning for the East Lindsey District Council elections this Thursday.    A spokesman for the Scout Movement said: We can confirm that a complaint was made to Lincolnshire Scouts about the st Marshchapel Scout Group delivering information for a candidates in the upcoming local election. Following receipt of this complaint the local volunteer manager spoke with the Group Scout Leader of the Scout Group concerned and it was clear this was a genuine error on behalf of the Group and one they have apologised for. In accordance with Scouting’s rules the matter was reported to the Charity Commission by the local volunteer manager. “Subsequently the Group Scout Leader of the st Marshchapel Scout Group submitted his resignation after taking full responsibility for the incident. “Other volunteers have also since resigned. No volunteers have been asked to leave the Scout Movement because of this incident. The spokesman from Scout HQ said: Scouting is a non-political organisation. We canapost support any party. Delivering leaflets for a political party breaks our rules.   Scout leader, Matt Whall has posted a message on the village Facebook page apologising for the error.He said: I have stepped away from involvement with Marshchapel Scouts.Sadly, this is as a result of recent events in our community. “As you may be aware the Scouts recently distributed leaflets around the area. This was done in exchange for one year rent on an allotment space for the Scouts to grow veggies and learn about all things green, and not for financial gain for the group. “We hoped to run a soup kitchen for the community using veg grown in the village. The leaflets happened to be for a candidate in the local elections.    He added: ...The Scouts were  % safe at all times during this activity. I did not ask the Scouts to distribute leaflets for political gain or promotion but did something purely with the motive to provide an enriching opportunity for the Young People in the Group. It was an error on my part. As a consequence of this, coupled with a total lack of support for our Leaders from The Scout Association itself and their approach in dealing with the complaint, all the other Leaders have independently decided that they no longer wish to continue in their roles.” The councillors were approached for comment.

He sent off both applications on the same day near the beginning of April. However, he said one was processed in Belfast while the other was processed in Liverpool. When both arrived within days of each other this week, the Liverpool passport - Oscaraposs - had the words aposEuropean Unionapos while the Belfast passport - Archieaposs - did not.He said it was mind-blowing that the Home Office was mucking around with passport designs when there was still the risk of a No Deal Brexit . He added: The whole thing is like a terrible sitcom. The whole management of Brexit has been a bad comedy. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Burgundy passports that no longer include the words ‘European Union’ on the front cover were introduced from  March . “In order to use leftover stock and achieve best value for the taxpayer, passports that include the words ‘European Union’ will continue to be issued for a short period after this date. “There will be no dference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not.

The striking minimalist flat, measuring just square feet, cleverly contains a living room, kitchen, dining room, bedroom and bathroom. Once simply an empty space, the area has been transformed into a cosy sleeping space, an area for entertaining guests, or a well-appointed cooking area by simply opening or closing a few hatches.Dubbed the aposZero-Room Apartment apos, the property has been designed by Hungarian Architect Studio M S, a husband and we team based in Budapest. The work can be completed for under £,, a reasonable rate considering the prices of some city centre properties .   Architects Bálint Gulyás and Orsolya Mészáros said: Creating a really tiny flat is always a challenge. However, checking the continuously increasing real estate prices there is a really big need for bringing out the most of all square meters and create great living conditions even in the smallest places. The main concept of the zero-room apartment was to totally rethink a former traditional flat with only m. To create the largest spaces possible, all the interior walls were demolished. The closed areas such as the bathroom, toilet and a really small mechanical room are located along the entrance, while everything  is in the spacious aposmainapos room.    Since the main room serves as kitchen, dining room, living room and bedroom, the furnishing played a particularly important role. One of the biggest challenges the team faced was making sure the living space didnapost look cluttered. Since the aposmessapos and the interference of dferent s put in one space had to be avoided, a mobile, iable furnishing was created, where most of the elements can be hidden, continued the M S designers. The main goal was to create a totally al apartment, that can be easily converted into an ordered work of art by closing some doors.    To hide or unhide the everyday mess of a kitchen or a wardrobe, special opening-sliding doors were used on the furniture. This way the main s of a flat can be separated - closing the kitchen doors hiding the bed -, and you can enjoy the benefits of having a spacious living working dining room. The zero-room apartment is a first attempt at giving a solution for great and comfortable aposroomless livingapos.

A survey of , adults revealed what is and isn’t acceptable to talk about with their emotions, religion and infertility all considered more socially acceptable to discuss than finances and debt. Just  per cent consider the delicate topics of miscarriage and infertility to be off-limits compared to one quarter who say the same about personal finances. Similarly, one in five don’t think it’s suitable to disclose their salary in social settings and more than half believe the subject of money should be completely off limits at work. Other unacceptable conversations include drugs, sex and parenting techniques, with Brits going as far as to say discussing these apostabooapos subjects leaves them feeling aposanxiousapos and aposnervousapos. The research was commissioned by Lowell, which helps consumers and businesses manage credit better, and wants to highlight how talking helps. Clinical and counselling psychologist Tamara Licht Musso said: “Not talking can seem the best short term strategy, but is a negative coping mechanism and at some point it cracks. “Avoidance is also a classic way of coping to keep anxiety at bay, but we cannot avoid our thoughts, which is where all emotions emerge, therefore pushing back such thoughts may result in them appearing through symptoms such as dficulties with sleep.    “Taking the ‘easy’ route might seem to be the answer because the rational path – talking - puts us in a much more vulnerable position. In the short term this may be true, but it puts us in a healthier place in the long term. “The fear of being judged is based on distorted thinking patterns such as jumping to conclusions and mind reading. “For example, some people will think that by sharing their salary others may misjudge their ability.” The research also found more than half fear being judgedthey were to open up about personal issues, while another one in two avoid certain topics because they find it ‘embarrassing’. Others keep quiet as they donapost want to share their personal lives, believe itaposs rude to talk about certain things or worry about the consequences of opening up, with more than one third fearing it could lead to arguments. One in five are afraid talking about things will break up their relationship and one in  even fear losing their job. However, due to avoiding discussions about an issue,  per cent have experienced loss of sleep and one sixth have even suffered from mental health issues. It also emerged that  per cent consider opening up to be a ‘big step’ and feel itaposs sometimes aposeasier to keep it to yourself’. And almost half of those polled via OnePoll wish society made it easier and more acceptable to talk about things. Lowell’s Managing Director John Pears added: “Breaking down these taboos and having open, honest conversations helps understanding, and can pave the way to finding answers to problems. “Talking to someone is the first step, but it can obviously be dficult and many are worried, aren’t sure who can help or don’t feel they can trust someone. “We know that when it comes to money or debt, people can be particularly sensitive or embarrassed about it, and customers tell us that not talking has caused them to worry more and for things to get worse, which really doesn’t have to be the case – there is help out there.”Top  most socially unacceptable things to talk about according to Brits...

Natalie Cave was sitting by a fire pit when she was knocked down by an inebriated sixteen-year-old who was reversing at speed. The -year-old was pinned beneath the vehicle with fire pit debris burning into her leg at Dark Sky Glamping campsite in Northumberland. She suffered a broken ankle as well as nerve and ligament damage which required three operations and skin grafts. The mum-of-two was also kept in hospital for one month and was forced to quit her customer service job at Greggs as she was unable to cope with the physical demands of the job. Natalie had been camping overnight at the beauty spot for a birthday celebration with friends Leanne McGough, , and Jemma Armstrong, .   During the stay, McGough, who works as a nurse, gave driving lessons to the drunk -year-old in Armstrongaposs Audi. Newcastle Crown Court heard how the car went out of control and knocked Natalie and another guest to the ground in August last year. Natalie, from Sunderland, was left seriously injured, while the other victim was unhurt. After the crash, McGough and Armstrong, who works as a support worker, hatched a plot to hide the truth about the incident from the police. Armstrong told police she had been the driver at the time of the accident and her fake story was backed-up by passenger McGough. Within a day, the women went to the police station and confessed a drunken youth had been behind the wheel at the time. McGough, of Sheppard Terrace, Sunderland, and Armstrong, of West View,  Sunderland, both pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. McGough admitted a further charge of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Natalie, who no longer speaks to the pair, was left devastated when they were handed suspended sentences by a judge at Newcastle Crown Court on Friday. Natalie, who is a single mum to Fraser, six, and Finley, four, said she now suffers from anxiety and constant pain. She said: My le has been whipped up from under my feet. Itaposs scarred me both physically and mentally.  I lost my job because of my injury and I canapost do anything with my sons.

Prosecutor Michael Bunch told the court the teenager had been described by  witnesses as mortal and falling over drunk after the group had been drinking. When the lesson started, McGough had initially been driving but later swapped places. Mr Bunch said: The group became aware of the Audi, being driven in reverse, at high speed, towards the fire pit. Some described the speed at -mph, others suggested the speed was aposexcessiveapos. All witnesses effectively refer to the car being out of control. The court heard the car hit one woman to the ground, who was uninjured, but Mr Bunch added: The car knocked the complainant to the ground and ran over her lower right leg, pinning her to the ground. Some of the contents of the fire pit became lodged in her leg.  The court heard both women, who have no previous convictions, initially lied about who had been the driver but told the truth within  hours. Andrew Finley, defending McGough, handed in a pile of references from colleagues, including doctors at Sunderland Royal Hospital who described her as honest, thoughtful and loyal. Mr Finley told the court: It was an ill judged decision for a driving lesson to take place on the field. Vic Laffey, defending Armstrong, said the hard working and devoted mum has  children with health problems, has no previous convictions and said what had been planned as a celebration for a group of friends ended up as a disaster. Mr Laffey said Armstrong, who feels huge remorse, is highly regarded in her community and at work, poses a low risk to the public and is never likely to be before any court again.  Mr Recorder Thyne sentenced McGough to  months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with  hours unpaid work.  The judge told her: There would be a signicant loss to Sunderland Hospital, and nursing more widely,you did not keep your job, in the long term.  Armstrong was sentenced to  weeks imprisonment, suspended for  months with  hours unpaid work.  The judge said: There would be a harmful effect on numerous others, family members, patients and others in the event of an immediate custodial sentence. The teenager is due to be sentenced at the youth court this week. Natalie said she now has a recurring nightmare about her youngest son being run over, following the incident. She said: At the beginning my boys were so upset. They both broke down when they came to see me in hospital. I missed my little oneaposs first day of school because I was in hospital. Simple things like walking to the park I canapost do. I don’t feel like Iaposve got closure.

Maheen Hayat suffered countless threats against her le after intentionally ending an arranged marriage in Islamabad. She had been due to marry a -year-old man in an arranged Islamic ceremony when she was just  but fell in love with her first cousin, Aftab Khan, instead. The former science teacher trainee, who is now , told BirminghamLive: I didnapost know what was happening, I was a child. It was a commitment and, when girl becomes woman, thataposs the departure, when the girl moves from parentsapos home to groomaposs home. I was confused. I started my studies to become a science teacher.  I worked hard at my education and I did my bacheloraposs [degree] and then I started a job teaching. Thataposs when I met my first cousin, Aftab. He used to come over to my house. I fell in love with him and then I realised my parents tried to finish [arranged marriage] but, due to pressure, they couldnapost. I didnapost want an arranged marriage, I kept putting it back and back. I got threats against my le from the groomaposs family. They said we want departure or rukhsati, as itaposs traditionally known we want our bride to come home. They kept saying after one week, after two weeks, we want a ceremony... I was feeling so much pressure. In  Maheen and Aftab decided the only solution was to flee Pakistan and to fly into London with everything they had. Maheen arrived in the UK heavily pregnant and on a student visa - but soon struggled to get by. She said: Me and Aftab decided to get an Islamic marriage and decided that the only solution was to go out from the country.    A series of delays and struggles followed for Maheen and squash coach Aftab, who worked part-time in a takeaway in London. In , their asylum application to stay in the UK as refugees was declined. But they insisted their lives were at risk back home in Pakistan. During the same year Maheen fell pregnant with her second child, Raaposid. Maheen said: We both couldnapost work properly, we couldnapost get work permits. [The Home Office said] I had to go back, because my asylum was not accepted, I came as a student. I wanted to stay in the UK. When my first child - Labeeb - turned seven, thataposs when I applied for a family visa. Maheen, Aftab and their children  were housed at a home in Edgbaston for six years by security firm GS. In December , Maheen and Aftab were successfully granted indefinite leave to remain and obtained permanent residency in the UK. They struggled to pay for their £-a-month rent in Handsworth and were later ordered to leave their house. Since February , have been living in a hotel in Walsall, paid for by Birmingham City Council.    Maheen, whose sons are eight, five, and three, said: We have applied for Universal Credit and are continuing to search for jobs. My husband canapost speak English that great. One day, my husband went with a man and he said OK we will let you do paint with us, and all they gave him was £ all day. I struggle to buy food, I have no money. Weaposve been in a hotel for almost three months and weaposre waiting for a house now to become available. First [the council ] will put us in a temporary house or flat and then we must bid. Itaposs hard, Iaposm borrowing from friends £ off one friend, £ from another. I have got three kids to feed. The council is paying for the hotel and I get £ child benefits per month. I try to be limited. Itaposs not enough. Aftab is searching for a job. Itaposs very hard you know. The coupleaposs dream is to one day run their own takeaway. Maheen, who has applied for a number of school jobs, said: We would like a free takeaway, fish and chips and curries to run. And the money we make we pay for it back. Anything like this. Thataposs our dream, because I can do cooking and cleaning and heaposs a good cook and we can make money by running a takeaway. Maheen said she is trying to stay positive about her situation. All of the time my kids say, aposMum, why does this happen to us apos I say, aposThank God, give thanks to Allah that youaposre eating, you are healthy, you are good, you have got shelter, you are not on the road, you sleep with full belly.apos I keep them positive. Sometimes I become depressed, my husband is sensitive, panicking and saying whataposs happening and being fed up. I just say everything is happening so slowly and everything will be good, donapost lose your hope. Iaposm only one giving them hope - and I love my family. Birmingham City Council has been approached for comment.

Labradoodle Ozzie was in the dog house after wolfing down the wad of £ notes in his home. The nine-year-old pooch spotted the money as it was posted through the letterbox for his owners. Ozzie munched his way through the cash in a plastic bank bag while his owners Judith and Neil Wright were out shopping. And they came home to find pieces of banknotes scattered all over the hallway and kitchen - and Ozzie looking guilty. Neil, , said: “We had been out shopping and Ozzie was home alone. “We came home and found the money all over the hall and the kitchen.    “I phoned the person who had posted it through the door to ask how much money it was. “We took Ozzie to the vets and thankfully he has made a full recovery.” Neil and we Judith, , of Llandudno, North Wales, paid a vet £ to get the money out of Ozzie. Ozzie was also found to have a plastic money bag and a circular money clip in his belly after the vet’s treatment. The couple were left £ out of pocket - but happy that Ozzie was well.    Judith said: “We have had Ozzie since he was a pup and he has been known to eat other items before but never money.” The couple now plan to fit a cage to their letterbox to stop greedy Ozzie in future. Ozzie was taken to Murphy  Co Veterinary Practice where his stomach was emptied. A spokesman for the vets said they had never seen a dog eat money before. Neil added they may be able to reclaim £ from the Bank of England. The bank says as a general rule it will only reimburse the face value of a damaged banknotethere is still at least half of the banknote left.

Hannah Vaughn Setzer, , was born with cystic hygroma, a condition causing multiple cysts to grow. It has left her with literally thousands of them in her head and neck. She says her parents were advised they should abort her in the womb and that she wouldnapost survive birth - orshe did she wouldnapost be able to walk or talk. But her parents ignored doctors and Hannah was born in September . During one of her many surgeries she needed after birth, Hannah claims doctors were aposscooping handfuls of cysts out of her headapos when they accidentally removed some of her facial nerves - leaving her unable to smile.    But Hannah is brimming with self-confidence and passionate about educating people and advocating for disability rights. She was fitted with a feeding tube and tracheostomyas a newborn and defied medics by flourishing, changing her tube independently as a teenager and brushing off cruel comments from strangers. Physically, disability rights advocate Hannah has completely proven medics wrong, turning to health and fitness in adulthood. She now blogs her journey under the moniker Feeding Tube Fitness. Hannah, from Virginia, USA, said: People have stared, pointed and whispered aposwhataposs wrong with her apos a million times over - Iaposve heard it all. But I honestly donapost care - people can think Iaposm ugly or dumb or look weird or scary and thataposs fine. I think Iaposm really great and thataposs what matters. I really hate when people tell their kids to be quiet. Children are curious and should be taught that people look all dferent ways and itaposs OK to ask questions and to be educated. Iaposd much rather a kid learns that people with disabilities and medical conditions exist in the world than be shunned and treated like a leper.    Hannah has a sense of humour when it comes to her condition and accidentally scares people that see her sleeping. My eyes just roll back in my head so it seems dark when I sleep, she explained. It terries people that donapost anticipate it and Iaposve scared plenty of people that way. But she admits the cruel comments have got to her in the past. I can tell you unkind things that were said to me over  years ago word-for-word, she said. They stick with you, itaposs hard. Words do have weight and do matter. People are ignorant, say dumb things and are uneducated. I just have to know that for every unkind thing or unkind person, there are multitudes of people that have my back. I am ridiculously confident in myself. I think and know I am beautul, I like my body, I know Iaposm smart and I have a lot to offer the world. I also have an amazing husband, Brandon, and tribe of people who shower me with love daily and Iaposm very grateful.  Hannah met Brandon, , online in January  and the couple made things work long-distance before getting engaged a year later, and married in September . But her comfortable le is a far cry from what doctors predicted before she was born. When Hannah was diagnosed with cystic hygroma in the womb, her worried parents had no idea what to expect and she says doctors suggested they abort the baby. Instead, she was born on September ,  and medics immediately sprang into action to remove the cysts from her head and neck. In the process, some of Hannahaposs facial nerves were accidentally removed as doctors scooped out the cysts by the handful - leaving her unable to close her mouth or eyes, she claims. A couple of days later she was fitted with a feeding tube and tracheostomy, which she has had ever since.  There are literally thousands of the cysts in my head and neck, theyaposre in my airway and oesophagus so I need the trach and feeding tube, Hannah explained. My trach doesnapost require much thought or maintenance -anything gets stuck I can blow it out or run hot water through it. Food is a dferent story though, and her tube requires more preparation and attention. Hannah is able to swallow water in small quantities but things like smoothies and milkshakes are too thick. She said: I can taste and chew food and often crave it - Iaposll either just wipe it out with a napkin or brush my teeth. I definitely get aposhangryapos! I have issues with stomach acid which can be really painful and gets worse the hungrier I am - so itaposs in everyoneaposs best interests to get me food.  Slightly more pressing is the worry that her stoma will leak - which it regularly does. I have a gauze around it because it isnapost a perfect hole and it leaks food, stomach acid, water - pretty much whatever is in my stomach can leak out, Hannah explained. I change the gauze pad between - times a day and it seems to have a mind of its own when it comes to how much it leaks day-to-day. The leaking does mean I ruin a lot of clothes, so I only buy cheap stuff. Pretty much everything I buy is second hand because itaposs bound to get ruined within six months, so I donapost buy nice things. But otherwise, Hannah isnapost fazed by her condition and instead focuses on the positives - like being able to eat whenever, wherever.  She said: I can eat on the go, while Iaposm sleeping, in the shower, in the car wherever. I can just hang my bag up and carry on my day, and at work I donapost need a lunch break so it means I can leave early. I honestly donapost care when other people eat around me. Brandon and I go out to dinner and I just sit there and talk a lot. I donapost typically take my bag out unless I have to - Iaposm not embarrassed, but why welcome more stares than I already get all the time  While she says doctors initially guessed she wouldnapost live to one year old, the prediction changed each year as Hannah grew and, despite numerous surgeries, she flourished. Physically, she is the strongest she has ever been after challenging herself to  days of movement in . I wasnapost super active as a child. My parents were hesitant to let me play sports because they thought Iaposd get injured or hit in the face. They did let me do karate and I got to a yellow belt but then got kicked in the face and quit. Then in  I decided to move my body for  days, and that became , then , then  - and now itaposs just daily and I havenapost stopped yet. Iaposm healthier, happier, more active, more disciplined and way more grateful. Iaposm sure I would run fasterI wasnapost breathing through a hole in my neck but, honestly, nothing really stops me.

The slow slip event was so gradual most people would not have noticed - but the creeping tremor has so far released the same amount of energy as a .-magnitude quake - just over a longer period. GNS Science geophysicist Dr Laura Wallace said smaller .-magnitude quakes around Waipukurau and Porangahau were probably linked to the recent slow quake.   In a slow-slip quake, the Earthaposs crust moves up to tens of centimetres over weeks rather than rupturing suddenly in seconds as in a normal quake, Stuff New Zealand reports.These events have been possible precursors for giant, megathrust quakes and appear to have occurred on the undersea plate boundary off Japan two months before the magnitude . quake in March , which generated a deadly and destructive tsunami. During the past week, southern Hawkeaposs Bay GPS sites, such as those at Cape Kidnappers and Pawanui, had also started moving, she said.    This suggests that the rupture of this slow-slip event is propagating south now too. Propagation of slow-slip events from offshore Gisborne into the Hawkes Bay region was also observed in . GeoNet GPS sites showed several centimetres of slip at the surface.

One of the vehicles in Caracas is firing a water cannon at protesters who crowded around the vehicle and had been throwing stones at them. And at one point the vehicle accelerated, then shuddered to a quick stop, appearing to hit several people. Another armored vehicle appears to have ran directly over protesters at a dferent section of the roadway.Approximately  people are estimated to have been injured due to government aposrepression techniquesapos which includes the use of tear gas.   Earlier today Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido called for a military uprising to oust President Nicolas Maduro and armed factions exchanged gunfire outside a Caracas air base as the country hit a new crisis point after years of political and economic chaos. Since  Venezuela has suffered one of the worst economic crisis in their history - which is also among the worst in the world.It started in  when then-president Hugo Chavez declared an aposeconomic warapos because of food shortages. The country has been hit by chronic shortages of food and medicine, blackouts and a UN report estimated in March  that % of Venezuelans live in poverty. Guaido urged protesters and members of the military to join what he called the aposfinal phase of Operation Libertyapos in a video taken at La Carlota airbase in the capital Caracas. The troops then set up defensive positions around the base before Maduroaposs forces arrived and opened fire with teargas followed by live rounds, according to witnesses. Today the defence minister said that armed forces remain loyal to the constitution and that the aposact of violence was partly defeatedapos.  The Venezuelan ambassador in Madrid, Mario Isea, said a a reported coup attempt against the government had failed and claimed that all military bases are loyal to the Government. Venezuelaaposs Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza denied there was ever a military coup underway to oust President Nicolas Maduro and accused Juan Guaido of operating under orders from Washington. It is not a coup attempt from the military. This is directly planned in Washington, in the Pentagon and Departmentof State, and byBolton, Arreaza told Reuters in a phone interview.  They are leading this coup and giving orders to this manGuaido, he said, adding that Maduro was still in full control of the country with the backing of the military. Juan Guaido is recognized by Brazil, the United States and dozens of other Western nations as the countryaposs interim leader. While Brazil has recognized Guaido as the interim leader of Venezuela, it has opposed military intervention there to overthrow Maduroaposs socialist government.

Although to lose Connor so early was a blow for us in the game.“We are starting to get down to the bare bones of the squad – but we have been here before and coped with it and we’ll do the same again this time.“We have a big enough squad and enough good young players to come in and fill the places of the players that are absent.“We are still chasing that European spot of third and that task continues against Celtic on Saturday.“Last season it went to the final game and we won against Celtic to finish second.“This year will be the same – we just need to take care of the next three games and hopefully that will get us third spot.”Although the Dons’ squad is down to the bare bones, they are still three points clear of fourth-placed Kilmarnock.McKenna believes the experience gained at the end of last season, when Aberdeen won at Parkhead on the last day of the season, can stand them in good stead this term as they again look to secure Europe.He added: “The experience of last season can help because in last season’s run-in we were very strong.“We need to be much the same again this year. Last season we didn’t lose after the split.“Unfortunately this year we have lost after the split so it means we need to win an extra game.“We’ve beaten Hibs and Hearts at home this season and we’ve run Celtic close getting beat - at home.“At Parkhead we’ve been narrowly beaten - and drawn -, but we’ll look to change that in the next game. ”McKenna was disappointed to lose to Rangers on Sunday. Although the Gers did control proceedings, the stopper was frustrated by the goals Aberdeen conceded.Both were penalties from James Tavernier, but McKenna felt they were both soft awards by referee Don Robertson.The first was when Nikola Katic hit the deck after a tangle of legs with Lewis Ferguson, and for the second the same player went down holding his face when jumping with Andy Considine at a corner, with the Dons defender receiving a second yellow card following the incident.McKenna said: “It was obviously a very disappointing result for us.“We went to Ibrox with the intention of getting three points and we’re leaving with nothing.“They had a lot of possession as they usually do in games at Ibrox. But we have managed to deal with that in previous games.“On Sunday, Joe Lewis pulled off a couple of unbelievable saves to keep us at - at half-time.“Then to come out at the start of the second half and concede a goal so early was tough because it looked like a soft penalty. I thought Fergie was maybe pushed a bit and then Katic just throws himself to the ground.“And with the second one I turned round and saw Andy had his hands up and Katic has his hands up.“Then Katic throws himself to the ground again and wins the penalty.“I felt it was another soft decision, but they didn’t go for us.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.5505791-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.5505791-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.5505791-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.5505791-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeens union terrace gardens revamp start in summer","story":"Work to transform Aberdeen#s Union Terrace Gardens will start this summer after a contractor was appointed.Balfour Beatty has been chosen to carry out the £. million works on the historic gardens.The plan will see the space transformed into an #inclusive st Century space# while #enhancing UTG#s heritage features#.LDA design, the firm behind London’s Olympic Park, unveiled their designs for the park in .The flagship project was originally due to be completed by July but had been knocked back until .The transformation of the park includes creating shop and cafe spaces in the arches, and installing water features and community gardens, with work expected to take between  and  months to complete.Council co-Leader Councillor Douglas Lumsden said: “With the selection of Balfour Beatty as contractor, the job of turning the vision for Union Terrace Gardens into reality is about to start in earnest.“This is a moment for celebration right across Aberdeen.“The investment we’re making is transforming our city and the benefits will be felt throughout the region. Generations to come can share in the rewards.”Hector MacAulay, Balfour Beatty’s regional managing director of Scotland and Ireland, said: “We are looking forward to working with Aberdeen City Council to transform the historic Union Terrace Gardens, which on completion will signicantly contribute to the Council’s City Centre Masterplan.“Our construction expertise coupled with our experience in regenerating public spaces makes us ideally positioned to deliver the three new pavilions and sympathetically upgrade this much-loved historic space which will benefit the local community and visitors alike for years to come.”SNP Group Leader, Councillor Stephen Flynn said: “I am sure the people of Aberdeen will be at a total loss as to how the administration can justy spending almost £ million on Union Terrace Gardens when they are continuing to make severe cuts to services across the city.“Project costs have soared by at least £ million since  and it is now certain that the gardens will be delivered two years late – what a complete shambles.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cc2fdb94c6587.05276450.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet strider tara and bond are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This handsome pup is one year old and has been neutered.Strider is a friendly boy with lots of love to give the right family.He will need a new owner who has the time to continue his training as he is strong and has not been good with other dogs while in the kennels.He is not suitable to be homed around cats or young children due to his boisterous nature.Can you offer Strider his forever home Tara is five years old and has been neutered.This lovely girl is a larger dog who will need a home with access to lots of space for her to run around in and a secure garden as she can jump quite high.She needs a home with no other pets but is used to children over  years old.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14580367.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_180419rugby_02JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club prepare murrayfield","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club prepare for Murrayfield date with destiny against HeriotsThe club will bid to land a fourth Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double this season when they head for the capital on Saturday.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsAyr Rugby coach Peter Murchie and his players \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Make mine a double, writes Ron Evans.That was the cry at Millbrae when the pink and black faithful realised that their team had created the chance to win the Tennent’s Premiership and the Scottish Cup in what will be the last opportunity to achieve this feat under the current league set-up. Ayr have been there before of course in  when they won the Premiership by defeating Currie then the Cup final against Melrose with the unforgettable Cammy Taylor try in the injury time of extra time. This time, however, they take on Heriot’s in both games. Having won the epic Tennent’s Premiership play-off final against the Goldenacre outfit two weeks ago, the Nailsare again Ayr’s opponents on Saturday in the cup final at Murrayfield. It might be inappropriateto suggest that Ayr are going out to hammer the Nails on Saturday, but that is exactly what they plan to do. Now in possession of more senior cup and league medals than any other Scottish player, veteran full back Grant Anderson told some of the rookies for whom this is a first- time experience: “You think beating Heriots at Millbrae was good  “Doing it at Murrayfield will feel a hundred times better!” Skipper Pete McCallum, heading for his third cup final at Murrayfield with a won one lost one record, certainly agreed that it was great chance for the players to express themselves on the big stage. “Playing on the international pitch is always something really special so we want to enjoy the occasion and go out with a bang,” he said.  As was the case at Millbrae, there will be little to choose between the two sides, their regular league form having panned out with an away win each but in the winner-takes- all contest for the Premiership title showdown, Ayr were superior. “Yes, we are in a good place but there will be no complacency” said coach Peter Murchie. “It was a physical game and we would expect the same in the cup final. “Thankfully we didn’t pick up any injuries and we were able to give the squad a bit of a rest after the last game which has let us build gradually towards Murrayfield.” “The squad are totally motivated as you would expect from any team going into a cup final becauseyou can’t be motivated for that then I donapost know what would get you up for a game. “I have said several times to the squad that opportunities like this don’t come along very often in your career and you have to take those opportunities and make the very best of it. “Some of our squad have experienced this situation before and our senior players will be a big part of what we achieve but we have some really exciting young talent as well so we will give it our best shot and hopefully have a great finish to what has already been a memorable season.” It has indeed been memorable andAyr do add a fourth Scottish Cup success to the Tennent’s Premiership title, then the call will likely be for trebles not doubles all round. Good luck. Good luck.A ticket for the Millbrae breakfast,coach travel and entrance to the match is £.Other options include £ for match ticket and coach travel and £ for the match ticket only.

The cash withdrawals took place between July  and May  and Cowan helped herself to more than £, of the patient’s savings. The Scottish Social Services Councilheard how the offence came to light when the victim, known only as ‘AA’ and requiring “multiple care needs” decided to alert care home staff, believing that the money would never be repaid.When shocked senior staff at Glebe House found out about the incidents they called the police and reported the matter to the Care Inspectorate and the SSSC. But in the subsequent investigation, Cowan was understood to have shown “limited insight and remorse” in respect of her actions. The victim gave evidence during the hearing, telling the SSSC’s Fitness to Practise Panel how, during a conversation with Cowan, she told her she was “worried about money.” The victim initially offered Cowan money but that invitation was declined. However, in a later conversation, around a week later, Cowan, who had no previous record of wrong-doing with the SSSC, indicated that she “needed a certain amount of money.” On this occasion Cowan was given the lady’s bank card and PIN and the service user believed £ would be withdrawn. In the weeks and months thereafter, a similar scenario took place “several times.” Several cash withdrawals took place from the ATM at the Co-operative, Dalmellington. Cowan then came up with a “sob story” about a family member’s Christmas present and again, the patient handed over her bank card. This pattern continued and the patient did not report the matter at that point because Cowan “promised to pay it back” and she “believed her.” However, the victim’s concerns grew and she reported the matter to other members of staff after fearing she wasn’t going to get her money back. Another witness claimed she was “shocked” that a carer had taken a resident’s bank card and withdrawn money for her own use. During the investigation process Cowan started to make repayments of the outstanding amount. At the hearing in Dundee the victim was described as a “lonely and vulnerable inidual” but “very switched on” and an “impressive witness” who gave her evidence in a forthright manner and was found to be both “credible” and “reliable.” In their written judgement the SSSC found Cowan’s conduct fell “far below the standards” expected, labelled her actions were “serious and deliberate” and amounted to a “signicant breach of trust.” The Panel also stated they could not be satisfied that Cowan had “acknowledged the gravity” of her conduct, or that she demonstrated “meaningful regret.” The judgement concluded: “A Removal Order is the only sanction that will provide an adequate safeguard against yourepeating your misconduct. “It is the only sanction that will ensure that service users are not placed at risk of harm and will maintain public confidence in social services and the SSSC as regulator.” Cowan was neither present nor represented at the hearing. A spokesperson for East Ayrshire Council said: “We are aware of the situation and understand that care home management acted appropriately in conjunction with Scottish Social Service Council and Care Inspectorate when they learned about allegations against the member of staff. “Through our contract management arrangements we actively engage with all the care homes in East Ayrshire to provide assurance in respect of the quality of service provided to residents.” The Post did contact Glebe House Care Home for a response but did not receive one.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrEast Ayrshire CouncilSocial servicesDundee"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14904281.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18944840.jpg","title":"ayr united startlet tipped make","story":"NewsAyr United startlet tipped to make big time -he avoids video game FortniteLuke McCowan won praise from boss Ian McCall after a brilliant debut in Ayrs - win at Firhill on Saturday.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsMcCowan is being tipped for big things\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIan McCall has tipped Ayr Unitedaposs newest star to make a name for himself - as long as he stays off computer games.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday. He is survived by Jean and their sons, Jack and Jamie, of whom he was immensely proud, and who, like their dad, have worked abroad.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily

This mast should provide an lsquoemergency servicersquo for all the local residents and businesses should our land lines fail, as they frequently do.ldquoThere have been many occasions when accidents have happened with no means of getting help.ldquoThis will also be a great asset to tourists and traffic passing through our valley.The local branch of the National Farmers Union, which counts  members, has also thrown its weight behind the proposals.In a support letter, Selkirk branch secretary Rory Murray writes: ldquoIt is vital that in todayrsquos connected world, basic services now include the provision of a reliable mobile network, and not just for the obvious benefits to rural safety, should people be stranded without signal.ldquoA solid G signal will transform many agricultural-based businessrsquo ability to complete basic tasks that are now exclusively online, as the time constraints poor mobile phone signal and broadband signal places on rural businesses is a very real worry for our members.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council has received nine letters of objection to the plans, with objectors citing the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.Mr Brian Russell, of Selkirk, writes in his objection letter: ldquoThat the Ettrick valley must have mobile masts is disappointing to those of us who came here to escape such things.ldquoOf course escape is now becoming impossible anywhere on this island, but at the very least we had hoped to be allowed to live far enough away from a base station not to be adversely affected.ldquoHealth concerns for masts and cell phones are largely discounted now, but itrsquos as well to remember that the questionable safety of very profitable technologies may not come out for decades after their introduction, e.g. in the s and s there was widespread use of agrochemicals.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

election riots, contracted Malaria and suffered a iety of broken bones having fallen down a storm drain.Dominic, who is , told the Border : ldquoWe really donrsquot have any idea of how others live on the other side of the world in some of the poorest countries on earth.ldquoI spent most of my time living in slums, which ied from corrugated houses to mud houses with grass thatched roofs.During his time in Africa, Dominic acted as a trustee for Roll Out the Barrel Trust UK, a project that aims to help with water supply issues in some of the worldrsquos poorest countries.Dominic also helped found a charity in Kenya, The Sunflower Community Orphans Support Project.The organization helps feed orphaned children, many of whom are affected by poverty and HIV AIDS, by using the proceeds of a cafeacute selling food to the public.Dominic fully embraced the lestyle of the local community, enduring the same daily struggles faced by the local population.ldquoI experienced what it was like to have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude to le since ing to the UK in March.He added: ldquoAfter selling most of my things to help fund this mission I now own very few items and the ones I do own I appreciate more.ldquoI appreciate things

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills.

Papers related to its commission and invoices confirmed it had been installed in  ndash the same year the revolutionary turbine was designed by Eric Crewdson, who had outlined its features while serving in the trenches of the war.Crewdson conceived the idea of a side-entry impulse turbine capable of running at twice the speed of a Pelton water-wheel turbine, with a higher efficiency across a broad flow range.Within months of ing from the war, his concept had been developed and the first Turgo turbine installed at a property in Crieff.However, it is no longer operational ndash making the Stewartsrsquo refurbished and repainted turbine the oldest operational example version of its type in Scotland.The refurbishment was carried out by the original manufacturers, while Mr Stewart set about removing a build-up of silt from the burn.He added: ldquoThe turbinersquos governor alone, which controls the flow of water and is a beautul piece of engineering, must have weighed half a tonne ndash the new one only weighs around half a pound. Now it all works beautully.The savings ndash and earnings ndash have been signicant.

Before the last referendum, many voters inherently distrustful of nationalism were brought over to Yes because it seemed open and embracing, it offered an alternative to failed Westminster. Progressives and centrists, and even some on the right, found a comfortable home as Yes voters.

Stop following these people on social media, stop amplying their nasty messages ndash especiallyyoursquore in elected office.Which takes us to our second point ndash outreach. The Yes movement must once again start chasing voters and not talking to itself. Woo undecideds. Woo Unionists. Woo everyone. Self-congratulatory backslapping does nothing.

Having once boasted an extensive tram system that connected all corners of the city and beyond to its bustling centre, it now relies on the only subway in the world never to have been extended, a bus network so inadequate that a quarter of its inhabitants must take at least two buses to get to work, and a rail network that, despite being the UKrsquos best outside London, remains disjointed and struggles on a daily basis to keep up with demand.Sure, several subway stations have been scrubbed up in recent years and the pound million revamp of Queen Street Station will bring a long-overdue injection of modernity to one of the cityrsquos main transport hubs, but itrsquos hardly the stuff of a thriving metropolis with pretensions of becoming a major player on the European scene. Plans unveiled by the Glasgow Connectivity Commission, a body founded two years ago by council leader Susan Aitken and chaired by transport expert Professor David Begg, could change all that, bringing benefits not just to the city but its inhabitants too.In a report published this week, the commission has unveiled bold plans for transforming Glasgow into an ldquoinclusive, thriving, liveable city within the next  years by, among other things, enclosing the section of the M that cuts a polluting tract through the city and creating a cycle-route network that connects the economic centre to the suburbs and surrounding areas that feed it. It is the proposal for a Glasgowthat could make the biggest dference overall, though, by bringing parts of the city that were cut off when the tram system was abandoned and rail network rationalised out of their imposed isolation.The plans for Glasgow itself would see abandoned rail routes such as the one that connected Maryhill to the West End via a stop at the Botanic Gardens reinstated, while a new line would create a much-needed link between Renfrew, Braehead, the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the city centre. A tunnel under the Clyde, meanwhile, would link the services operating out of Queen Street and Central stations to create a joined-up service stretching across the whole of the Central Belt while an extension to Glasgow Central would pave the way for the kind of high-speed services that would make it possible to travel between Glasgow and London in three hours or less.The plan for Glasgow Airport, which revives the idea of a rail link to Paisley Gilmour Street for a connection to Glasgow rather than one straight to the city centre itself, remains highly unsatisfactory for a city that craves a role on the global stage. Anyone who has made the frustratingly fractured journey from Luton Airport to Luton Airport Parkway then onto the centre of London could tell you that a city that has secured signicant job-creating investments from employers like Barclays but will always compete with the likes of Manchester and Birmingham for further deals should know it too. But with the report noting that connectivity ldquois the leblood of any socio-economic system and that transport networks ldquoinfluence a cityrsquos quality of le, shape its urban fabric and determine the type of economic activity it supports, the bulk of its recommendations are exciting.Too much of Glasgow and its surrounding areas remain cut off from the parts of the city where jobs are created and sustained, with the two-thirds of the population who live near a train station or own a car most likely to benefit from those evolving opportunities while the third that do not remain left behind. Indeed, it should come as no surprise that the report found the most deprived areas of the city are poorly served by the rail network while the richest parts are not. A new train line will never solve the multi-layered social problems our most abandoned communities have been left to deal with, particularly as some of those problems pre-date the advent of the connectivity our most advantaged ones enjoy. It can provide an opportunity to help narrow the worst socio-economic gaps, though.One of the biggest barriers to such potentially transformational projects will always be the cost and the Glasgow Connectivity Commission reckons it will take pound billion over  years to make its vision a reality. In a pothole-ridden city that canrsquot even keep its streets clean today that is going to be one hell of an ask. And, with major projects such as the Queensferry Crossing, Edinburgh tram line and Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route already demonstrating how hard ambitious budgets and timetables can be to stick to, a project that would dwarf all of them in terms of scope and scale will remain a daunting one.Yet with the project promising to enhance Glasgowrsquos economic fortunes to the benefit of all its citizens, it must be a price worth paying. As Professor Begg said, ldquowe need to raise Glasgowrsquos levels of ambitionsuch a transformation is to be achieved.Dare we be so bold  We canrsquot afford not to be.Read more: Plans for a Glasgownetwork and Central-Queen Street tunnel unveiled"},{"url":null,"title":"israeli-firm-bids-to-buy-2bn-north-sea-oil-and-gas-portfolio","story":"Reuters reported that Delek had confirmed in a regulatory filing in Tel Aviv that it was in talks to buy Chevronrsquos oil and gas fields in the UK North Sea as part of its international expansion plans.Delek did not provide financial details in the filing but said a deal could be completed this year.The company has already shown it is willing to invest big sums in the North Sea.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline.

Also among those present was Janine Miller, we of Australian national Greg Miller who also lives in Orkney.This year the wreath was laid on the final resting place of –year–old Royal New Zealand Navy Volunteer Reserve pilot, LieutenantThomas Noel Bush, who was tragically killed on December , .Lt Bush’s Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter plunged from the sky above Kirkwall straight into the Peedie Sea — while, only yards away, people were in their homes, or going about their daily business.On that fateful day, Lt Bush arrived to pick up the aircraft and, following a few pre-flight checks, took to the air.However, within minutes witnesses heard the aircraft`s engine revving at high speed and, from a height of approximately ft, it ed straight down into the Peedie Sea, killing the pilot instantly.Local emergency services and personnel from HMS Sparrowhawk were quickly on the scene, but nothing could be done for the unfortunate pilot.Lt Bush’s body was recovered from the wreckage and he was buried, with full military honours, in St Olaf`s Cemetery, on the outskirts of Kirkwall, on December , .Kirkwall branch of the Royal British Legion chairman Dougie Manson said: “Those who died came from far and wide to serve their countries overseas, coming here today is the least we can do to remember them. It is important that we mark the sacrice they made.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With new surfacing laid over the last week, the council say that a short time will be required for the surface to cure, with the streets to reopen to traffic on Friday at the latest.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which include changes to the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, as well as providing a new path to the War Memorial on the Kirk Green.With the initial phase of the project now completed, works will be suspended for the main summer season. Plans are for work to move to the entrance to Victoria Street in the autumn, being suspended again in December for Christmas shopping season.The Places and Spaces initiative was developed alongside community groups such as the Kirkwall and St Ola Community Council and the Kirkwall BID, who identied key areas of the town where it was felt improvements could be made. According to OIC, proposed improvements were the positively received by the Orkney community during a two-day consultation period, where  per cent of those who attended said they supported the proposals,  per cent were against and the rest were undecided.The Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative is a five-year heritage-based grant scheme which seeks to deliver sustainable improvements to the built heritage of the Kirkwall Conservation Area, in an effort to regenerate the centre of Kirkwall for the benefit of local communities and businesses, as well as to attract visitors.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, however, it is time to bid readers of these pages adieu – or more appropriately, au revoir.I need to take my leave for the foreseeable future as I have decided to contest the European elections I would rather were not being held in the UK at all. So that columnists do not gain an advantage for themselves or a party it is a Scotsman convention thatthey take part in elections they step back from their regular slot. Sometimes they , possibly chastened, maybe emboldened – sometimes they don’t.Over the years I have had my detractors. As a Scottish unionist libertarian I inhabit a subset of a subset that makes my writing usually contrary to the prevailing view. I can live with that, but I cannot accept a vote of the people being ignored.Thus I am, paradoxically, about to stand as a Brexit Party candidate for the European Parliament I have argued our country should no longer be part of. I believe strongly this election puts the people’s trust in democracy at great risk.To maintain our belief in the value of voting, especially in referenda where everyone’s vote counts, it is necessary to give a voice to the anger, the disgust and the disappointment that many now hold for the politicians who have lied persistently and without shame about honouring the result of the  vote to leave the EU.Some readers might remember the time when a majority of those Scots who voted in the referendum of  supported the creation of a Scottish assembly – but not in great enough numbers to meet the legal threshold that would make it a reality. There was palpable outrage among many that the decision did not count. Imagine then that the vote for a Scottish Parliament in the referendum of  had been ignored by the Labour government of the day that had promised to deliver it  Or imagineScotland had voted for independence in  and three years later the SNP government had, despite repeated promises, failed to deliver it – encouraged to fail by a Westminster government serving a cocktail of threats, bullying and political chicanery.The electorate would be beyond itself with anger and indignation, incredulous that a democratic decision had not been respected and honoured.I have warned many times from these pages that the Conservative Government and the Labour opposition are trying the patience of the voters for stating they would abide by the vote to leave the EU on  June  only to continually go back on their word. I cannot recall a period, certainly not in this country nor in my letime, when so many promises have been made – and repeated for emphasis – only to be broken without any concern for the damage it does to the credibility of all politicians or the debasement of democracy.I cannot recall ever a British Cabinet that has so callously abandoned collective responsibility so government becomes anarchic and impotent – and ministers might vote against their official position but carry on taking their superannuated paycheque.I cannot believe a British government would be so willing to accept one part of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, would operate under dferent commercial regulations where the only recourse to representation about such damaging rules would be through representatives of a neighbouring foreign power. Nor can I believe the same government cannot see its dalliance with a second referendum only strengthens the hands of separatists in Scotland who wish for a second vote too.The leaders of both main parties opposed Brexit and lost. They defined what Brexit would look like , that there would be no EU army, and amplied at full volume the immediate economic crisis we would facewe voted against their advice . Yet, for all the foregoing scaremongering the electorate decided in our biggest democratic vote ever to “take back control” of our laws, our money and our borders. Since then we have seen the creation of an EU army and the surreptitious offer of our military forces to it. We have seen the best growth of the largest economies in the EU, witnessed our employment grow by a staggering , and the UK become the top destination for foreign investment in the world.It was as a result of the electorate’s expressed will the new Prime Minister, Theresa May, promised us “Brexit means Brexit” – only for her to ensure in her tin-eared dogmatic detachment that now Brexit must mean remain. Her withdrawal treaty will mean continuing with the very rules and regulations we were told could be reformed or abolished, that direct trade deals with other nations cannot be realised and that customs tarfs that ensure our food and clothing costs more cannot be reduced.We will leave the Common Fisheries Policy one minute only to rejoin it immediately the next. Worse still, being an international treaty it cannot be amended and offers us no break clause for escape. With so many of May’s promises broken her words and phrases have lost all meaning when “no deal” was once “better than a bad deal” – it is now her bad deal.The law of the land was we would “leave the EU on  March”. Conservative and Labour MPs voted together by a huge majority for it to happen, deal or no deal. If they had been sincere in their promises we would now have left and no elections would be necessary. I have previously been invited toto the political fray, but on all occasions I found it easy to decline. This time is dferent, this time giving electors a means to defend democracy itself by campaigning for a party that believes in having the referendum respected is something I cannot ignore, despite the economic risk to my livelihood.So it is au revoir as I join others of all walks of le, from left and right, all races, religions and genders – but who believe democracy matters.I thank you all for you comments in the past, be they supportive or critical.

Take me outside, tie me to a pole, light me a fag and don#t bother with the blindfold.The idea of ‘Best Place To Live’is stupid and patrionising, which is just a lazy PR concept.It’s the Emperor’s New Clothes for the ‘creatives mafia’ in any city, which in the case of Dundee comprises of around  people spread out between the West End, Broughty Ferry and the burgeoning town of Newport-on-Tay which for the uninitiated happens to be in Fe.It lets the cooncil off the hook and allows them to focus all their energies into talking the place up while ignoring the hard stuff that needs done like providing care for the elderly which won’t win them awards or plaudits.It fosters a culture of positivity at all costs where the first casualty is always the truth – sweep the bad stuff under the carpet – we do le sciences here don’t you know The city of jute, jam and journalism was named Scotland’s BPTL earlier this month by the Sunday Times, hot-on-the-heels of coming sixth on Lonely Planet’s Best in Europe  list of places to visit. The media barrage since the opening of the new VA franchise store on the waterfront has been held up by luvvies everywhere as a classic example of how a bit of the old culture can drag a place out of the doldrums with a slice of bread and jam for everyone.: VA Dundee named the world’s best public buildingI don’t buy it, like I don’t buy the opposite side of the spectrum which labels a place “drug capital of Europe” – as happened to Edinburgh in the s – with the focus shting from the VA to Dundee having the highest rate of drug deaths in Europe.Makes for punchy headlines – evendrug deaths aren’t recorded on a like-for-like basis across the continent. If culture is the be-all and end-all then surely London would have no kne crime given the huge choice of galleries and museums on offer in the teeming metropolis.No doubt Dundee’s fake valium problems – and I shy away from using the word epidemic – have been acute with the local authorities needing to do more, particularly in terms of providing addiction support services.But the tired media narrative framed around the place highlights the duality of over-the-top coverage of the opening of a museum being followed up with the horror story of drug deaths.There is no room for the middle ground where the real truth lies.Rather like the theory of inverse care in health, where those who need it most receive the least, an influx of professional types into one area will substantially improve it simply because they shout the loudest. The middle-class are brilliant at advocating change and will complain about anything and everything, especiallyit impacts on the lives of their precious little darlings.: Le expectancy in Dundee falls as Glasgow worst in ScotlandThey are also media-savvy and will hit Twitter and Facebook like billy-oh , for example, the bins are not getting picked up quickly enough. You only have to walk a mile or so from any ‘trendy’ place in Scotland’s cities and you’ll find abject poverty. The poor don’t benefit from the regeneration with not so much as an out-of-date avocado thrown their way.I have friends and family from Dundee, lived across the road in Tayport for seven years and like the area and the people. I know Dundonians who take the absolute mickey out of all the hype surrounding the place and others who think anyone not talking it up to the nth degree deserves a swt ‘punch in the pus’.I consider my home in a Fe mining village to be my current BPTL. It includes an ice-cream shop, a target shooting shop, one that sells crystals, a solitary pub called The Crystal, a Chinese takeaway and a unisex haridresser called Kutz for U.

Labour Finance spokesman James Kellysaid the pound would be “immediately replaced” by a new Scottish currency.“The effect this would have on people’s mortgages, savings and pensions is that they would need to be converted into a new currency from sterling at a cost of up to %.“This would have a catastrophic impact on business and the economy.”Scottish families and businesses would be “signicantly worse off”, he added.For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"former minister sarah boyack to replace kezia dugdale as msp","story":"A former Scottish cabinet secretary, who served under Donald Dewar, willto Holyrood to replace Kezia Dugdale when the former Scottish Labour leader quits front line politics this summer.Sarah Boyack will take the list seat set to be vacated by Ms Dugdale, who yesterday announced her decision to stand down as an MSP and take up a role as director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service in Glasgow University.Ms Boyack said she was ing to deal with “unfinished business.”Currently head of public affairs role with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, she was an MSP for Edinburgh Central constituency from the very first days of the Scottish Parliament, which is celebrating its th anniversary this year.: Kezia Dugdale says new role is ‘unique opportunity’She served as Minister for the Environment, Planning and Transport in the first two years of the new Scottish Executive before becoming Minister for Transport, during which time she introduced one of Scottish Labour’s flagship policies of free bus travel for people over  and disabled people.While she lost her seat in the  election to the SNP’s Marco Biagi she still ed to Holyrood as a list MSP.

Ballymena Sea “Cadets are committed to providing our cadets with as many opportunities as possible, so we are delighted to announce that from later this year we will be offering the Duke of Edinburgh awards for any cadet that wishes to participate in it.”Ballymena Sea Cadets are actively recruiting for both instructional and management team members.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733277.jpg--.jpg?1555495901000\n","title":"ballymena city of the eight towers","story":"Local children have created a new fantasy tower to add to Ballymena’s famous ‘crest’ !And it is one of a number of striking features on is new imagination-fuelled mural which has appeared asby magic in Bryan Street, with the help of Artists Leo Boyd, Laura Nelson and local children.Workshops were held in The Braid Arts Centre on the theme of comics and cartoons and, as a result, local children have delivered a new fabulous monster sized artwork for the town centre.The Bryan Street painting, which is part of a larger arts project called Opening Doors being delivered by the Arts Service of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, was supported and partnered by BID, which is the Ballymena Improvement District.BID and Councils Arts Service identied some sites in the town centre for re-imaging and engaged professional mural artists to deliver workshops for local children.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"yfc get on their bike with 75km for 75 years","story":"Rathfriland Young Farmers Club are set to kick off their th anniversary celebrations with a bang this weekend.The club are delighted to announce their first event to commemorate the milestone anniversary with a sponsored cycle challenge.

They’ve been to an All-Ireland semi-final and they know when to stop the game and they have a few marquee players. I thought our boys matched them. We were under the cosh at times, but our boys showed desire and pride too. The conditions were dficult and we saw some of the shots and passes out there – the game was probably lucky to be played, but the surface was fine.”The teams were closely matched for the first  minutes with Antrim’s Paudie McLaughlin cancelling out an early Liam McDonald free for Monaghan.However, the hosts were dealt a blow when full-back Emmett Irvine, who had impressed in the early stages, picked up a black card after  minutes and the Farneymen assumed control for the remainder of the half with scores from Jason Irwin, Darragh Dempseyand McDonaldputting them - to - ahead at the break.Antrim’s second and final point arrived via a well-taken effort from Daniel McNicholl while Irwin landed his second of the evening on  minutes.Yet, the Monaghan captain, booked in the first half, picked up a second yellow for a high tackle moments later and the visitors were guilty of some cynical fouling as they looked to preserve their lead.Another Dempsey free moved them four clear inside the final  minutes and they looked to have done enough to seal victory.Antrim’s Ryan Lennon was black-carded for a third-man tackle, but a clever pass across the face of goal in stoppage time from Reuben Carleton allowed McNally to palm the ball past Joe Kirk in the Monaghan goal.Monaghan corner-forward McDonald was issued with a straight red for a strike while Antrim didn’t have time to muster a late equaliser.McAllister’s men must quickly regroup for the Qualiers as they will face Armagh in the Athletic Grounds on Saturday afternoon.ANTRIM: J Rodgers R Carleton, E Irvine, M Ferris R Hagan, E Higgins, S O’Callaghan J McNally -, D McNicholl - R McKillop, S Madden, C Higgins P McLaughlin -, R Lennon, R Boyle.Subs: C Killough for Irvine , M Lynch for Higgins .

I was delighted to be able to update the community face-to-face at the inaugural ‘Empowerment through engagement’ public meeting in the newly-built Good Shepherd Parish Centre. We took those present through the criteria obtained from the Department for Infrastructure for each of the locations. There followed a very constructive conversation with the local stakeholders present. The residents, school, youth and sporting organisation leaders all had ideas about how we could work together to build a profile to meet the department’s requirements, thus speeding up progress and change. We then arranged a face-to-face meeting between the stakeholders and the department. We voiced our concerns, including the fact that, at no time in the assessment process for new crossings, was there a public consultation.Such was the success of the meeting that arrangements were made for a second meeting on mental health, an interactive session with the superb local organisations Aware, Inspire and PIPS. Each of these bodies showcased what they do and how we can improve mental wellbeing in our area. Again, the focus was on introducing the local community to important organisations who can help us to access better services. One of the most pleasant effects of the meetings is the frequency of inquiries from constituents about the next meeting. An inquisitive community is an empowered community.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland schoolchildren should get free fruit or veg says report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you open a calendar on any given week you will find a reason for politicians to hold off engaging with each other..pushMarching season, conference season, elections, pressure in Westminster, negotiations in Brussels and issues within inidual parties are just a few examples.Little more than a week ago the usual script had been written, and was widely accepted, for the weeks ahead.Politicians in Westminster, Brussels, Dublin and Belfast were taking an Easter break in the assumption that there could be no engagement while local and European election campaigns were being fought in Northern Ireland in May. The script said the parties were on the doorsteps and would inevitably maintain partisan politics until the elections had past.Just after pm on Thursday April  that script was torn up by the senseless and heartbreaking murder of a woman whose name we have all come to know, Lyra McKee, whom, by the outstanding tributes of her partner, family and friends, we all wish we had known in le.As a politician and Tanaiste there are many things you experience that are unique but there are only a handful of experiences that you know will stay with you until the end of your days.Being in the front pews of St Annes Cathedral as an unstoppable wave of applause, hope and demand hit the most senior politicians from the UK and Ireland in the base of our spines is one such moment I will never forget.The words of Father Martin Magill summed up the desire and frustration of all communities in Northern Ireland in a sentence,\"Why in Gods name does it take the death of the -year old woman, with her whole le in front of her, to get to this point \"Last summer violence in Derry saw live bullets being fired and police officers narrowly escaping injury or death. In January seven young people were minutes from being killed after they passed the car bomb that sat in the centre of Derry. However, on April  the cowards claimed a victim. The fact that it was a journalist and writer who was a shining example of everything Northern Ireland can achieve is the reason so many people have come together to mourn.The night before Lyra McKees funeral I sat in Strand Road police station in Derry with the officers who had tried to save her le. These men and women are hardened by the fact that petrol bombs can be thrown at them in the course of their everyday work but on Tuesday night they were numbed and vulnerable at the fact that a young woman had died beside them. Despite their Land Rovers being alight with petrol and live ammunition being fired at them, the PSNI left its secure position to get to Lyra McKee after she had been hit. They made the decision to drive to Altnagelvin Hospital, officers performed CPR on Lyra for the entire journey and they stayed and supported her partner and friends as the horrible news of her death was confirmed. The leadership shown by the PSNI in Derry has rightly been applauded by the community it serves.While I heard Father Magills rallying call for political leadership loud and clear, I also heard what he said about the events in Derry as the news of Lyras murder sunk in: \"I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday.\"Arlene Foster, Michelle ONeill, Colum Eastwood, Robin Swann and Naomi Long were not ordered to release a joint statement by anyone or told to go into the Creggan. When a dark moment threatened to drag Northern Ireland back to a dark past their natural inclination was to do the right thing.We now have a window where the Irish and British Governments are calling the parties together. We have all spoken in person and on the phone many times in the last week and without exception I believe all the party leaders are genuine in their desire toto Stormont.As we meet in the weeks ahead, a conversation I had with Mrs Joan McKee will be foremost in my mind.Standing in the side chapel of St Annes was the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as well as myself as Tanaiste, the Secretary of State and ministers of both governments. Despite all the power of those elected offices we were standing there as a group that was utterly powerless to comfort a woman who had, as Joan put it, \"lost her baby\".We owe it to Joan and Lyra McKee to make sure no other ceasefire babies are murdered in the prime of their lives and to make sure that Northern Ireland has a ing government.There is never a perfect time to do the right thing in Northern Ireland. However, there is a right time and that time is now.Simon Coveney is Tanaiste of the Republic of Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"eleven men convicted over unnotified republican parade in derry","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The District Judge saidthe fines were not paid within the next twenty-six weeks, the matter would be referred to the Fine Collection Agency.CCTV footage of the parade which took place in Central Drive in the Creggan area on the afternoon of April , , was played in court. Several police officers gave evidence of public disorder prior to the parade during which petrol bombs were thrown at police Landrovers by groups of masked youths. Between them the officers said during their evidence that they were able to identy eleven of the twelve defendants, as well as six other men who were not charged with the offence.A PSNI Inspector told the court that prior to the parade he and other officers went to Junior McDaid house in Chamberlain Street where he planned to explain to the parade organisers that as the parade was unnotied, those taking part were liable to prosecution. He said the doors and shutters on the house were closed and he put a warning letter in the letter box of the house.The police witness said he then went to the Creggan along with an evidence gathering crew and as TSG support group. There a pre-recorded message warning that the parade was illegal was played from police Landrovers which also contained signs that the parade was unnotied.The officer said at the scene of the parade masked youths threw petrol bombs, planks of wood and masonry at police lines during a period of sustained rioting and at one stage his officers were faced with a human wall of masked rioters.A Chief Inspector said in the lead up to the parade he had unsuccessfully attempted to engage with members of the community in order to reach a resolution.The Chief Inspector said he initially deployed a minimum of officers but had to increase their numbers because of the rioting.Two police constables said in evidence that they identied most of the defendants following a controlled viewing of CCTV footage recorded by the P.S.N.I. at the scene.The District Judge said the evidence against the defendants consisted of police CCTV footage as well as police statements. He said the defendants had exercised their right not to give evidence and that was their prerogative.\"The evidence of the police constables is quite clear. This was an unnotied parade within the terms of the legislation. The police had no intention of stopping nor interfering with the procession,\" he said.\"If it had been notied the police would have been observing from a distance but they had to attend in case people goose stepped around in paramilitary garb and that is an offence and because there may be preparations being made to attack police in the area.\"The police moved in, observed those taking part in the parade and identied a number of people with the exception of one of them who case has been adjourned in order to allow a legal matter to be examined. Even in the absence of anything to the contrary the case has been made out against all defendants so they will be convicted on the evidence.\"There are relevant previous convictions in this case. It is clear this event lead to serious public disorder and a display of paramilitary activity of a quite unacceptable nature. However no one has been charged with that. They are charged with taking part in an unnotied procession. Maybe they do not agree with the law but it applies to everybody across the board\", he added.The District Judge said while people had the right to parade, there were too many processions in Northern Ireland. He said parades organisers were responsible for ensuring there were no paramilitary displays at parades.\"Whether or not they agree with the law they are bound by it. That is the way society has to work\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland catholic school population surges to record high","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But it was by far the most-serious challenge yet to Mr Maduro’s rule since Mr Guaido, with the backing of the US, declared himself the country’s interim president in January in rejection of a government he accused of “usurping” power.The dramatic events began early Tuesday when Mr Guaido, flanked by a few dozen national guardsmen and some armoured vehicles, released a three-minute video filmed near a Caracas air base in which he called on civilians and others in the armed forces to join a final push to topple Mr Maduro.En el marco de nuestra constitución. Y por el cese definitivo de la usurpación. https:t.co RDbnQhxt— Juan GuaidóApril , Pueblo de Venezuela inició el fin de la usurpación. En este momento me encuentro con las principales unidades militares de nuestra Fuerza Armada dando inicio a la fase final de la Operación Libertad.— Juan GuaidóApril , In a surprise, standing alongside him was Leopoldo Lopez, his political mentor and the nation’s most-prominent opposition activist, who has largely been unseen since he was detained in  for leading anti-government protests. Mr Lopez said he had been released from house arrest by security forces adhering to an order from Mr Guaido.“I want to tell the Venezuelan people: This is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers,” Mr Lopez declared.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Opponents of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro throw stones at soldiers As the two allies coordinated actions from vehicles parked on a highway overpass, troops loyal to Mr Maduro sporadically fired tear gas from inside the adjacent Carlota air base. A crowd that quickly swelled to a few thousand scurried for cover, with a smaller group of masked youths reassembling outside the air base’s gates where they lobbed rocks and other heavy objects.¡Nervios de Acero! He conversado con los Comandantes de todas las REDI y ZODI del País, quienes me han manestado su total lealtad al Pueblo, a la Constitución y a la Patria. Llamo a la máxima movilización popular para asegurar la victoria de la Paz. ¡Venceremos!— Nicolás MaduroApril , “It’s now or never,” said one of the young rebellious soldiers, his face covered in the blue bandanna worn by the few dozen soldiers who stood alongside Mr Guaido and Mr Lopez.Mr Maduro tried to project an image of strength, saying he had spoken to several regional military commanders who reaffirmed their loyalty to his socialist revolution.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Rebel troops who are rising up against the government of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro fire their weapons “Nerves of steel!,” he said in a message posted on Twitter.The dramatic events, playing out in the opposition’s stronghold in wealthier neighbourhood of eastern Caracas, appeared not to have triggered a broader military revolt.Defence minister Vladimir Padrino on Twitter rejected what he called an attempt by a “subversive movement” to generate “panic and terror.”The ruling socialist party chief, Diosdado Cabello, said most of Caracas was calm and called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend Mr Maduro from what he said was a US-backed coup attempt.About a dozen government supporters, some of them brandishing firearms, gathered at the presidential palace, answering the call by Mr Cabello to defend Mr Maduro.“It’s time to defend the revolution with arms,” Valentin Santana, head of a militant group, said in a video posted on social media as he brandished an automatic rle.Mr Guaido said the troops who had taken to the streets were protecting Venezuela’s constitution. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A military vehicle is parked at the airstrip of La Carlota air base He said that in the coming hours he would release a list of top commanders supporting the uprising.“The armed forces have taken the right decision,” said Mr Guaido. “With the support of the Venezuelan people and the backing of our constitution they are on the right side of history.”To @jguaido, the National Assembly and all the freedom-loving people of Venezuela who are taking to the streets today in #operacionlibertad—Estamos con ustedes! We are with you! America will stand with you until freedom  democracy are restored. Vayan con dios! #FreeVenezuela— Vice President Mike PenceApril , As events unfolded, governments from around the world expressed a mix of support for Mr Guaido while reiterating calls to avoid violent confrontation.US National Security Adviser John Bolton, in a Twitter post directed at Mr Padrino, said the armed forces “must protect the Constitution and the Venezuelan people”.US vice president Mike Pence was one of several figures in the Trump administration to tweet support for Mr Guaido.Meanwhile, Spain’s caretaker government urged restraint, while the governments of Cuba and Bolivia reiterated their support for Mr Maduro.“We hope with all of our strength that there is no bloodshed. We support a peaceful democratic process in Venezuela. We support the immediate holding of an election for a new president,” Spanish government spokeswoman Isabel Celaa said."},{"url":null,"title":"prehen house reopens doors city derry jazz festival","story":"Prehen House is delighted to reopen its doors this May as part of the City of Derry Jazz Festival, welcoming singer   songwriter Terry Monaghan who will be performing, with his full band this Thursday evening , then for a more relaxed set on the Sunday afternoon .Terry is a singer   songwriter   psychologist living in Gortahork in the heart of the Donegal Gaeltacht and has been composing and recording music for the last  years.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour. I will be contacting the Departmentrsquos permanent secretary, Katrina Godfrey, to have a full review and overhaul of the ferry services to ensure that this does not happen again.Strangford businessman, Robert Duffy, owner of a Mace grocery store, confirmed that the village was snarled up with traffic on Saturday evening but reported traffic and the ferry had been running smoothly over the rest of the Easter bank holiday weekend.However, Mr Duffy added: ldquoThe traffic was only bad for a couple of hours on Saturday evening and it was compounded by Saturday night mass in Strangford.ldquoSaturdayrsquos problem was that there was only one boat on. There was racing in Kirkistown and you had between  and  motorhomes travelling from Bishopscourt and that happens every single year.ldquoIrsquove been here  years and it is what it is ndash holiday traffic. The queue management was very good, I was down the street on Sunday and Monday and it was moving well.The Department of Infrastructure was unable to provide a response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch U","story":"BALLYMACARN Park was bathed in sunshine as the talented lsquoHinch U- squad battled with Virginia for a place in the showpiece Ulster Carpets Cup final at Kingspan Stadium.Despite the heat, both sides put on an excellent display of running rugby in an entertaining encounter with Virginia drawing first blood, taking advantage of an uncharacteristically passive lsquoHinch defence to score from deep with their first attack.lsquoHinch began to work their patterns and took the lead with a typically powerful carry and score from Morgan Croskery and a fine finish from Jojo Naga.Virginia battled back and spent the final minutes before half time battering the lsquoHinch line.Fine close quarter defence enabled the home side to clear their lines but more sloppy defending from the backs allowed Virginia to gain territory and they scored to leave the tie evenly poised at -all.During the half-time break the lsquoHinch coaches asked for more urgency in defence and better ball protection in attack and were rewarded with a superb  minutes of rugby from their side.A line out move was executed perfectly for Matthew Torney to pop up a short pass for a charging Croskery to steam onto the ball and over the line untouched.The home forwards then bullied their opponents in consecutive mauls and Torney used all his power to help himself to a typical close-range score as the Virginia forwards tired.Any thoughts of a comeback were derailed by much improved line speed in defence as Cameron Patterson led the line superbly, driving his man back behind the gain line repeatedly and galvanising his team.James McMaster and Luke Braithwaite were also busy, using their power to disrupt attacks and win turnovers.A Croskery sin-bin was easily absorbed and when Naga finished an excellent Dan Hewitt chip ahead to give his team a  point lead, the match was effectively over as a contest.lsquoHinch emptied their bench to give everyone some time on the pitch and the game lost a little of its intensity as it entered the final  minutes.To their credit, Virginia battled up field for a consolation score with the last move of the match to leave the final score -.League champions, City of Armagh, await the local boys in the final on May  at Kingspan Stadium on what will be a great occasion for this dedicated group of players.Their quarter-final exit from the league play-offs did not do them justice and they have regrouped well over the past few weeks to put together an excellent cup campaign.Hooker Harry McCarroll epitomised the work ethic on Saturday with an all-action man of the match display and senior players continue to set the standards as the season reaches a conclusion.All support welcome on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac recognised with two accolades  ","story":"A STUDENT and upcoming politician at Downpatrickrsquos St Patrickrsquos Grammar School recently won two prestigious awards in consecutive days.Cormac Savagereceived the awards for his work in the local community, including engaging young people in politics and for his efforts with local charities like the Mid Down MS Support Group.Cormac mdash who is currently a Member of the Youth Parliament representing South Down mdash was nominated for a Michaela Foundation Wings Award and a Youth and Future Talent Awardin the inspirational young person category by St Patrickrsquos Grammarrsquos head of music, Celeste McEvoy.Cormac delivered a rousing speech last November in the House of Commons with the UK Youth Parliament about the topic of homelessness and, in particular, its gender impact on safety.Also late last year, Cormac gave , local young people the chance to have their voices heard about which issues are most important to them as part of the lsquoMake Your Markrsquo campaign.His first accolade came through The Wings Awards run by the Michaela Foundation in memory of Michaela McAreavey, the young bride murdered on honeymoon in Mauritius in .Cormac said he felt ldquooverwhelmed to have won one of the four awards in the age - category with  young people shortlisted.The awards, set up by Michaelarsquos husband John and her father, Tyrone manager Mickey Harte, seek to recognise young people who have been ldquomotivators within their local community.The following night, Cormac was recognised as an lsquoinspirational young person at the YAFTA awards run by Newry and Mourne Youth Council and Down Area Youth Council.Cormac said the whole experience felt ldquosurreal, adding that it was a ldquototal honour.

The Town Committee asked for the money to go towards a two-week festival they are organising in the town this summer.But councillors bluntly pointed out this week that they have already pumping enough money into the resort for other activities and had already sufficiently helped the Town Committee.Councillors pointed out that the council had spent a ldquovery considerable amount of money in promoting a nine-week summer entertainment programme in Newcastle and had given specic help to the Town Committee in the funding of a joint press conference, advertising and publicity material, as well as providing Radio Newcastle and other facilities.Because of all this ldquoit would not be appropriate to gibe a cash grant in addition.However, the decision did not go down well with Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth, who said it was regrettable that the council had decided to give nothing to the Town Committee.She thought thatthe council could not help by giving the full pound, they should at least have given a part and she hoped the council would have another look at the request.Newcastle councillor Mr Norman Bicker, a member of the Town Committee, said he hoped the council might be able to do something, but he realised there was already a big council programme and he agreed that it was not possible to allow more money.The councilrsquos recreation officer, Mr Bryan Coburn, also pointed out that there was already considerable investment in finance and labour in Newcastle and he felt it would not be appropriate to give more.BALLYGOWAN mdash Bicycling Ballygowan minister, the Rev James Harper, peddled into town last week with a beaming smile on his face for he had just taken part in a smash hit -mile cycle to raise funds to build a new hall in his area.Mr Harper led a team of  modern bikes into Ballygowan on an  year-old penny farthing, which had been loaned to him by cycling enthusiast Albert Watson.The sponsored -mile bike ride took in Raffrey, Derryboy, the Pikestone, Crossgar and Saintfield. Between pound and pound was raised.Itrsquos not the first time Mr Harper, minister of Ballygowan Presbyterian Church, has come up with unusual ideas to raise money. When ministering in Killyleagh he took part in a sponsored bed push and also cycled on a tandem.Coping with the penny farthing proved easier than Mr Harper expected. ldquoIt was remarkably comfortable and I felt really refreshed after the journey, he said.ldquoThere was only one problem mdash it had no brakes, but the police helped us by going ahead to make sure the way was clear.The penny farthing dates from  and is ft in high. Mr Harper only got one half-hour practice to get the feel of it before setting out on the y journey.DOWNPATRICK mdash A proposal to locate a regional museum in Downpatrick has been supported by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Board members want to be involved in the museumrsquos management together with local councillors.The recommendation is that the museum should be the responsibility of the district council, but Board member Mr Jack Magee believes the concept is too narrow.Board members want top priority to be given to recruiting a pool of staff for regional museums and that they should be seconded for proper professional training to acquire a professional qualication.Meanwhile, Down Council is pressing ahead with its own plans to establish a museum in Downpatrick.The council museum was started before the announcement that Downpatrick had been nominated as the location for a regional museum and it is believed that the council museum will be used as the basis for the regional museum.Councillors have accepted that it will be some time before money will be made available for the appointment of museum staff, so a full-time curator is now needed to enable their lsquoDown Museumrsquo to progress properly.It has been confirmed that until the appointment is made, Mr Albert Colmer, chairman of the Lecale Historical Society, will continue to act as curator.STRANGFORD mdash The Strangford Ferry fares will be increased next week, despite strong protests from Ards and Down councillors and members of Portaferry Development Committee.Representatives from all three groups recently met with the Department of Roads Service, which operates the ferry, and were told that the increases were the absolute minimum which could be implemented.Down councillor Mr John Ritchie said he was told that the fares should meet at least % of the servicersquos running costs, which now stood at nearly pound, a year.KILLYLEAGH mdash The blueprint for Killyleaghrsquos one-day festival of family fun in June was revealed at a public meeting in the Cooke Hall in the town.The planned programme, ranging from car slalom, marathon darts, senior citizensrsquo talent contest and yard of ale competition, makes impressive reading, attempting as it does to involve the whole community.ldquoWe must put Killyleagh on the map, was the message message hammered home at the meeting by Mr Winston Maguire, chairman of Killyleagh Town Committee.The organisers received an enormous boost when local hotelier Mr Harry Briggs offered free of charge for three nights the main hall of the Dunmore Hotel.The organisers have appealed for sponsorship, especially donations for prizes. The townspeople will not only enjoy the one-day festival, but any profits made from the event will be ploughed back to provide Christmas lights for the townrsquos streets.DRUMAROAD mdash Outbreaks of sheep worrying hit the area at the weekend when more than  lambs were savagely attacked and killed by marauding dogs.Mr P J McGrady, a farmer from Drumaroad, lost ten lambs over the weekend, He spotted a black dog with white spots on his land and he rushed into his house for his shotgun, but the dog had gone when he went outside.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A pair of talented Ballynahinch sisters, Lesley and Gail Newham, are among four students from the South Eastern Music Centre who travelled to Grantham in Lincolnshire with the British Youth Symphony Orchestra this week.This is the second year in succession that the sisters have been chosen to join the  young musicians from all over the UK who will be giving concerts for the next two weeks.Mr David Newham, father of  year-old Lesley, who plays a horn, and  year-old Gail, an oboeist, is director and advisor of music for the South Eastern Education and Library Board.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A speedboat with the engine still attached was found drting in Strangford Lough close to Don OrsquoNeill Island on Saturday by Mr Paul McCann, of  Springvale Park, Dpwnpatrick.The speedboat was taken to a temporary mooring at Castleward Bay provided by Strangford Sailing Club. Later, when police checked on the speedboat, they discovered that it had been removed from the mooring.It is believed that the owner of the boat had taken it away, but Strangford police would like the owner to confirmthis was so.KILLOUGH mdash Down councillors have run into snags over their plans to provide playing fields in Killough.The council has applied to the Department of Education for a vesting order for land, but two objections have been entered by residents and the Department wonrsquot proceed until all possible alternatives sites have been investigated.SPA mdash The sixth annual inspection and display of First Spa Company of the Boysrsquo Brigade took place in the Arnold Hall over two nights last week.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support. Dean Henry Hull would have been here but he has other Good Friday service commitments. Irsquom very glad to have been able to come and represent the other churches in the town.Castlewellan parish priest, Fr Denis McKinlay, said: ldquoItrsquos been a great turnout today and great show of support and solidarity from some very important people. After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm. Itrsquos a prayerful day and it should be. Good Friday is the day and the resurrection is the day. Let those without sin cast the first stone.Fellow St Malachyrsquos parishioner Philomena Rice was there with her three grandchildren as she has done in previous years.ldquoI think itrsquos important to show my grandchildren the other church, she said. ldquoThey like coming out to this, carrying the cross as they call it.Ronnie Hamilton, secretary of the Castlewellan Area Bible Prayer Group said: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the turnout today and itrsquos more than we normally have.

Poor Sarah, however, was cornered by McNeilly in the Avoca at the presentation, who was heard regaling her of his past triumphs, including his  minute k and  minute  miler.Perhaps there was some consolation for Sarah in that she wasnrsquot subjected to Joe McCann recounting his illustrious Armagh .

It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening.

eight, episode three of Game of Thrones. Directed by Miguel Sapochnik – who also helmed fan-favourite episodes including ‘Hardhome’ and ‘Battle of the Bastards’ – last night’s instalment ‘The Long Night’ was billed as one of the longest and largest battle scenes ever committed to film or TV.And while the episode was filled with explosive and grisly scenes of warfare, some have been complaining that they were straining to see the battle, due to the episode’s apparently darker-than-usual cinematography.One Twitter user wrote: “Tried to watch Game Of Thrones tonight but the episode was too dark to see anything. It sounded very exciting though!”Another said: “I’ve been watching ep for  minutes, still don’t know what’s going on it’s too dark.”Some have suggested that people could have solved the issue by adjusting the settings on their TV’s, with one person stating: “Did people forget they can increase the brightness and contrast on their TVs ”Another claimed it may have been due to the limitations of streaming services: “One of the reasons for the ‘it’s too dark’ complaints about the new Game of Thrones is because so many will be streaming it. Many streaming services are still poor when it comes to video encoding for dark scenes.”However, plenty of viewers seemed to have no problem and were left wondering what all the fuss was about“Turn your light off, close your blinds and stop whining,” one Twitter user wrote.Another said: “I saw what I needed to see. Arya kicked butt. And the red woman came back and helped. Theon protected Bran till the end. Jorah protected Dany.”“I guess its winterfell’s fault for not having proper street lighting,” joked another.Man dies after being hit by two vehicles in Hampshire town Cranleigh School opens new

three places to Arlene Fosters right at the DUP manesto launch earlier this monthAlthough the two were never formally linked, it was the church which provided not just many of the early DUP candidates, but also the foot soldiers who enthusiastically campaigned for the upstart party which would smash Northern Ireland’s political establishment.There were always criticisms from some in both church and party who saw the tension between a secular party with ambitions of winning votes and a fundamentalist church with the aim of saving souls.But those largely lay below the surface until Paisley’s decision to enter government with Sinn Fein, something which dismayed many in the church, who had been taught to view Sinn Fein in theological terms as the representatives of evil. The church gave Paisley an ultimatum: Choose to remain as moderator or remain as first minister. He opted for the latter and, after  years, was replaced as moderator.In his blistering valedictory interview with Eamonn Mallie in , Paisley said that his church critics “do not have the ear of God on this matter [power-sharing with Sinn Fein]”, a claim which appeared almost sacrilegious to some within the church. He also said that his family no longer entered his former church – although his son Kyle remains a Free Presbyterian cleric in England.Then in December  the church criticised the party for allowing retrospective pardons of those convicted of homosexual offences to pass through the Assembly. In implicit praise of the DUP’s nemesis, the church said that the proposal “was opposed only by Mr Allister of the TUV while sadly many others remained silent”. The church said it was “deeply grieved and bitterly disappointed” at the failure of MLAs to oppose the pardons.Now the uneasy relationship between a party which sees the strategic value in secularising and a church which believes that God’s law is unchangeable have ed with the DUP’s choice of Alison Bennington, a lesbian, as one of its council candidates. Ms Bennington has said she is standing “based on what I can deliver as a councillor ... not based on my sexual orientation”, and it is clear that the party leadership has endorsed what in any other party would be a fairly unremarkable stance.Ms Bennington was chosen centrally by the party, itself an indication that the party was taking a strategic decision to test the waters with its supporters. But for a party which once campaigned under the banner ‘Save Ulster from sodomy’ for homosexuality to remain a criminal offence, it is nevertheless a striking indication of how the DUP is changing.Traditionalist DUP MLA Jim Wells, who is currently suspended by the party, has been outspoken about what he described as a hint of “a major – and very worrying – change in the policy of the DUP on social issues”.On Saturday, TUV leader Jim Allister said he was struck in canvassing “by the number of lelong DUP voters dismayed by what they see as their party’s softening on the gay marriage issue because of the Bennington nomination”.Mr Wells yesterday said that “many, many DUP members up to the highest level”, including MPs, MLAs and former ministers, had been in contact with him to express concern about the issue because it was “a huge change in the ethos and tradition of the DUP”.Free Presbyterian sadness at the political normalisation of relations that contravene Scripture Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The South Down MLA said that there was concern within the party that it was “a step towards other radical change” and that people who had in some cases been members of the party for  years “simply cannot come to terms with this decision”.At the weekend, DUP veteran John Carson, posted on Facebook about the decision. The Ballymena councillor, who is standing for re-election on Thursday, said that he had been aDUP member for  years but “I say quite openly and with no fear of the consequences ‘NOT IN MY NAME’. I first entered politics because of my admiration for Dr Ian RK Paisley and ... I make no apologies to anyone for saying I am an old Paisleyite.”He went on: “I believe in the coming days not only myself but many of us will have some soul-searching to do and some tough decisions to make”. Invoking images of Old Testament idolatry, Mr Carson asked people to pray for wisdom for “those of us who have not bowed the knee to baal” as they “stand against evil in these days”.On Saturday, the presbytery officers of the Free Presbyterian Church issued a statement which was unusually oblique for a denomination known for its full-frontal assaults on those it regards as acting sinfully. The statement, a clear response to the DUP move, did not name the party but said that it “underlines its opposition to all marital and sexual relationships outside the covenant of Biblical marriage”.It added: “Therefore, as a church we are saddened by the attempts of political parties to normalise and promote marital and sexual relationships that are in contravention of the clear teaching of Scripture.”The statement was read out in some Free Presbyterian churches on Sunday, although not in others, in what may be a hint of the church – as well as the party – being split on the issue.Although a tiny denomination, Free Presbyterianism has long exerted an influence which exceeds its size, both through the DUP and its frequent pronouncements to the media about issues of public morals.One church source said that there was a desire among some within the congregation to see DUP party officers who are members of the church disciplined for their role in Ms Bennington’s selection.In response to the church’s statement, the DUP merely said: “Our position on support for traditional marriage is well known and as the party leader indicated last week, it has not changed.”An academic study, published as the book The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest To Power, four years ago found that the Free Presbyterian Church continued to wield huge influence within the party, with % of DUP members being Free Presbyterian. That meant that Free Presbyterians were  times more common in the DUP than in the population.It has been clear for some time that the DUP is no longer “the DUP at prayer”. Butthe DUP continues on its path to expand its voting base, even the continued high levels of cross-membership of church and party may increasingly become a thing of the past.If that accelerates the DUP’s liberalisation it could be signicant for everyone in Northern Ireland.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES |  photos from the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKeeSpeeder clocked at mph on

Three years on, operators Penarth Quays Marina and Vale owners have not agreed on a way to bring it back into operation. Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

That anger and stoking of ision is dangerous and irresponsible.At that same rally we saw a leader of the far right who is a convicted violent racist criminal being applauded on stage.That should not make any us proud regardless of how we voted.The biggest threat to the union of the UK comes from a No Deal.It would not only destabilise politics in Northern Ireland but it would almost certainly guarantee another Scottish independence referendum.More turmoil that would not turn back the tide of austerity or add a single extra penny into our schools, the NHS or any other public service that we rely upon.I do not believe a ided UK Parliament can make a choice for the next generation of our ided countries.I was proud to sponsor two coaches and march alongside more than a million members of the public, including many people from Cardf South and Penarth calling for a Peoplersquos Vote.We need to go back to the people with a choice between a Brexit deal that Parliament can agree and our current deal within the EU.There is no simple choice to the isions that we face but I would as ever be interested to hear views from my constituents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"would you do a blind interview","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business Diversity and inclusion in the workplace has never been more relevant than it is today, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays Northern IrelandIn a recent global survey by Hays for International Women’s Day, we asked over , respondents on a scale of one to five how committed their employer was to achieving gender equality. Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/DEB.jpg","title":"debenhams pushes on with cva and store closures","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business Debenhams has launched its cost-saving plans as it reveals it will push forward with the closure of  of its stores next year, it has emerged. The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive. With margins so tight, that tax burden is making le dficult for high street retailers.\"View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Email-640x315.jpg","title":"it firm pinnacle hosting event at kingspan stadium","story":"Posted on Tuesday  April  by Ulster Business A leading IT firm will host an event at the home of Ulster Rugby at an event to help educate and inform businesses.
