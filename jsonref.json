The hospital\u0027s own review found no structural damage, but there were cracks in walls, broken water pipes and water damage.         The image above taken on Thursday shows hundreds of books which tumbled off the shelves at Kern County Library in Ridgecrest, California after a strong 6.4 magnitude earthquake          A wall at the Esparza Restaurant has several new cracks after an earthquake in Trona. The image above was taken on Friday         Fissures that opened up under a highway during a powerful earthquake that struck Southern California are seen near the city of Ridgecrest on Thursday         People take pictures of a mobile home in Ridgecrest on Friday. The home was knocked off its foundation in the Fourth of July earthquake         Workers repair power lines after they were damaged during an earthquake in TronaThe hospital was prepared to help women in labor and to give triage care to emergency patients. Fifteen patients were evacuated to other hospitals after the quake, Glenn said.The quake did not appear to have caused major damage to roads and bridges in the area, but it did open three cracks across a short stretch of State Route 178 near the tiny town of Trona, said California Department of Transportation district spokeswoman Christine Knadler.Those cracks were temporarily sealed, but engineers were investigating whether the two-lane highway was damaged beneath the cracks, Knadler said. Bridges in the area were also being checked.The Ridgecrest library was closed as volunteers and staff picked up hundreds of books that fell off shelves. The building\u0027s cinderblock walls also had some cracks, said Charissa Wagner, library branch supervisor.Wagner was at her home in the small city of 29,000 people when a small foreshock hit, followed by the large one, putting her and her 11-year-old daughter on edge.\u0027The little one was like, \u0027Oh what just happened.\u0027 The big one came later and that was scarier,\u0027 she said.The earthquake knocked over a boulder that sat atop one of the rock spires at Trona Pinnacles outside of Ridgecrest, a collection of towering rock formations that has been featured in commercials and films, said Martha Maciel, a Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman in California.Meanwhile, the nation\u0027s second-largest city revealed plans to lower slightly the threshold for public alerts from its earthquake early warning app. But officials said the change was in the works before the quake, which gave scientists at the California Institute of Technology\u0027s seismology lab 48 seconds of warning but did not trigger a public notification.\u0027Our goal is to alert people who might experience potentially damaging shaking, not just feel the shaking,\u0027 said Robert de Groot, a spokesman for the US Geological Survey\u0027s ShakeAlert system, which is being developed for California, Oregon and Washington.The West Coast ShakeAlert system has provided non-public earthquake notifications on a daily basis to many test users, including emergency agencies, industries, transportation systems and schools.         Traffic drives over a patched section of Highway 178 between Ridgecrest and Trona on Friday         Another crack on Highway 178 is seen above as construction crews work to fix a broken water line near Trona on ThursdayLate last year, the city of Los Angeles released a mobile app intended to provide ShakeAlert warnings for users within Los Angeles County.The trigger threshold for LA\u0027s app required a magnitude 5 or greater and an estimate of level 4 on the separate Modified Mercali Intensity scale, the level at which there is potentially damaging shaking.Although Thursday\u0027s quake was well above magnitude 5, the expected shaking for the Los Angeles area was level 3, de Groot said.A revision of the magnitude threshold down to 4.5 was already underway, but the shaking intensity level would remain at 4. The rationale is to avoid numerous ShakeAlerts for small earthquakes that do not affect people.\u0027If people get saturated with these messages, it\u0027s going to make people not care as much,\u0027 he said.Construction of a network of seismic-monitoring stations for the West Coast is just over half complete, with most coverage in Southern California, San Francisco Bay Area and the Seattle-Tacoma area. Eventually, the system will send out alerts over the same system used for Amber Alerts to defined areas that are expected to be affected by a quake, de Groot said.California is partnering with the federal government to build the statewide earthquake warning system, with the goal of turning it on by June 2021. The state has already spent at least $25million building it, including installing hundreds of seismic stations throughout the state.This year, Democratic Gov Gavin Newsom said the state needed $16.3million to finish the project, which included money for stations to monitor seismic activity, plus nearly $7million for \u0027outreach and education.\u0027 The state Legislature approved the funding last month, and Newsom signed it into law. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/07/04/13/048D2D5A0000044D-7212983-image-m-133_1562243462695.jpg","title":"Family portraits Linda McCartney retrospective","story":"Share this article \u0027The worse thing about that was everyone was very stoic, everyone kept a stiff upper lip and then one evening you\u0027d hear my dad crying in the next room.

Scotland was one of her favourite places on Earth and so many images were taken there.\u0027The retrospective also includes one of Linda McCartney\u0027s diaries from the 1960s and a selection of her cameras and photographic equipment.

He claims junior staff copied a manager’s signature on paperwork sent to her.He has compared the practice to the ‘robo-signing’ scandal in the US, when lower-paid staff at banks signed piles of repossession documents without having properly read them. Banks were fined $25 billion (£19 billion) in 2012 and had to pay damages to millions of victims who had been illegally repossessed.Mr Watts said: ‘People have been evicted from their homes because of these signatures.’The claims prompted calls from Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke, who sits on the Treasury committee, for Parliament to investigate. If proven, it could constitute contempt of court. ‘You can be jailed for it,’ he said. ‘We need to know how widespread this is. Both Mortgage Express and Lloyds need to hand over the evidence.’A spokesman for UKAR, which owns Northern Rock, Bradford \u0026amp Bingley and Mortgage Express, said: ‘UKAR completely rejects the allegation that it has had any involvement in the practice of systemic signature forgery or “robo-signing”.‘We have repeatedly asked the BBC to show us any evidence of this, which it refuses to do.’Lloyds said: ‘We strongly refute the allegations made by a single inidual, which have been investigated by the bank, and found not to be true.‘The law firm which produced the documents concerned has confirmed that the person who signed them was at work on the date they were signed, and that the signatures are genuine.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Owning one television secret happy marriage researchers claim","story":"British mother who went on the run for three years with her...Share this article Also on the list was really listening to your partner (38 per cent), never having secrets (34 per cent), and the classic never going to sleep on an argument (26 per cent). And for about a fifth of couples, having more than one TV is key as well as not hiding your phone password.

Bridges in the area were also being checked.The Ridgecrest library was closed as volunteers and staff picked up hundreds of books that fell off shelves. The building\u0027s cinderblock walls also had some cracks, said Charissa Wagner, library branch supervisor.Wagner was at her home in the small city of 29,000 people when a small foreshock hit, followed by the large one, putting her and her 11-year-old daughter on edge.\u0027The little one was like, \u0027Oh what just happened.\u0027 The big one came later and that was scarier,\u0027 she said.The earthquake knocked over a boulder that sat atop one of the rock spires at Trona Pinnacles outside of Ridgecrest, a collection of towering rock formations that has been featured in commercials and films, said Martha Maciel, a Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman in California.Meanwhile, the nation\u0027s second-largest city revealed plans to lower slightly the threshold for public alerts from its earthquake early warning app. But officials said the change was in the works before the quake, which gave scientists at the California Institute of Technology\u0027s seismology lab 48 seconds of warning but did not trigger a public notification.\u0027Our goal is to alert people who might experience potentially damaging shaking, not just feel the shaking,\u0027 said Robert de Groot, a spokesman for the US Geological Survey\u0027s ShakeAlert system, which is being developed for California, Oregon and Washington.The West Coast ShakeAlert system has provided non-public earthquake notifications on a daily basis to many test users, including emergency agencies, industries, transportation systems and schools.         Traffic drives over a patched section of Highway 178 between Ridgecrest and Trona on Friday         Another crack on Highway 178 is seen above as construction crews work to fix a broken water line near Trona on ThursdayLate last year, the city of Los Angeles released a mobile app intended to provide ShakeAlert warnings for users within Los Angeles County.The trigger threshold for LA\u0027s app required a magnitude 5 or greater and an estimate of level 4 on the separate Modified Mercali Intensity scale, the level at which there is potentially damaging shaking.Although Thursday\u0027s quake was well above magnitude 5, the expected shaking for the Los Angeles area was level 3, de Groot said.A revision of the magnitude threshold down to 4.5 was already underway, but the shaking intensity level would remain at 4. The rationale is to avoid numerous ShakeAlerts for small earthquakes that do not affect people.\u0027If people get saturated with these messages, it\u0027s going to make people not care as much,\u0027 he said.Construction of a network of seismic-monitoring stations for the West Coast is just over half complete, with most coverage in Southern California, San Francisco Bay Area and the Seattle-Tacoma area. Eventually, the system will send out alerts over the same system used for Amber Alerts to defined areas that are expected to be affected by a quake, de Groot said.California is partnering with the federal government to build the statewide earthquake warning system, with the goal of turning it on by June 2021. The state has already spent at least $25million building it, including installing hundreds of seismic stations throughout the state.This year, Democratic Gov Gavin Newsom said the state needed $16.3million to finish the project, which included money for stations to monitor seismic activity, plus nearly $7million for \u0027outreach and education.\u0027 The state Legislature approved the funding last month, and Newsom signed it into law. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/05/16/15678064-0-image-m-23_1562339250451.jpg","title":"Final photographs racing legend John McCririck revealed","story":"Share this articleJohn McCririck’s wife reveals he died after a secret battle with lung cancer – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Venezuelas Nicolas Maduro shows military mark countrys Independence Day","story":"Share this article As head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Guaido claims that Maduro\u0027s election in 2018 to a second, six-year term is illegitimate because the most popular political figures and parties were barred from running.Maduro refuses to step aside, blaming Venezuela\u0027s woes on an economic war against the country led by the Trump administration, and Guaido has not been able to lure a critical mass of soldiers to back him.

Now in the United States, Cristopher Figuera says his mission is to \u0027seek help to free my country from disgrace.\u0027In a sign of increasing international repudiation of Maduro, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, issued a scathing report Thursday accusing Venezuela\u0027s security forces of nearly 5,300 killings last year.

Singer Liam Halewood, 33, was desperate to break into TV, but it came at a £22,000 cost. Pictured before he undertook a drastic body transformation\u0027I decided that I\u0027d need to do something drastic to get my big break so I changed my whole look and my face despite my family begging me not to.\u0027On the outside people thought I was happy and had loads of money but unfortunately it wasn\u0027t the case. I was in debt, I became depressed, I was going through a orce, I lost everything to chase my dream.\u0027People thought I was a star, but in reality, I had nothing.\u0027It all began for Liam in 2009 when he auditioned for The X Factor in a bid to boost his singing career.         Liam Halewood after spending £20,000 on his appearance in a bid to break into televisionBut it would be seven years before the former drag queen was finally featured on the show after producers recognised his Alan Carr-esque features from a stint on E4\u0027s Four in a Bed in 2012.Liam said: \u0027I ended up in a segment on the Xtra Factor with presenters Melvin Odom and Rochelle Humes. I was dressed up as my drag persona and I had to give Melvin advice about how he could dress like one. It gave me a taste of TV and I loved it.\u0027But even though the Alan Carr thing got me on there, I felt trapped in that bracket so much that I felt I wasn\u0027t going to make it looking like I did.\u0027Liam decided drastic measures were in order, and got a new look - kick-started by E4 programme BodyFixers in 2017 - which stripped him of his resemblance to the Chatty Man comic.         Alan Carr at London Fashion Week 2018. Liam Halewood was previously scouted by TV producers for his Alan Carr-esque featuresBut that only spurred him on to go for more extreme procedures, and the upkeep of his new appearance proved costly - along with his new glitzy lifestyle.Liam said: \u0027It wasn\u0027t just the botox and fillers that cost a lot - I spent thousands on hotels so I could go to all the best parties and mingle with the right people, and didn\u0027t think twice about the £10 drinks I was buying everyone.\u0027I even spent £550 on a pair of Vivienne Westwood jeans which I don\u0027t even have anymore.

Shahidul Alam, born in 1955 in Bangladesh, based in Dhaka“Gang raped numerous times as a child, forced into pickpocketing, caned until unconscious, sold to a madame, Hajera Begum’s life has little that would give cause to smile. Yet she smiles. She cries too. Not because of the gang rapes, or the beating, or the many years she lived in the streets as a ragpicker, but when she remembers that a man who worked at an NGO refused to work in her team because she was a sex worker.”“When I first met Hajera in 1996, she was a sex worker in Dhaka. We became friends, and she and her friends would often visit us in our flat, which would be considered an unacceptable act in most Bangladeshi homes.She said: ‘You hugged me today when you saw me in the street, just like the old times. That’s something men will never do. They will have sex with me, grope me in the dark, rape me if they get the chance, but they will never hug me, as a sister, as a friend. That is what I want for my children. That they will grow up with dignity, in a world where they will be loved.’”The photographer, writer, curator and activist Shahidul Alam studied in London before returning to his hometown, Dhaka, in 1984, where he documented the democratic struggle to remove  General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who was in power from 1983 to 1990.Joana Choumali, born in 1974 in Ivory Coast, based in Abidjan“In Ivory Coast, people do not discuss their psychological issues or feelings. A post-traumatic state is often considered a weakness or a mental disease. People hardly talk about their feelings, and each conversation is quickly shortened by a resigned ‘ça va aller’. This work is a way to address the way Ivorian people deal with trauma and mental health.Joana Choumali is visual artist and photographer based in Abidjan, in Ivory Coast.

I seek out the traces of their passing on the land.”“Cry Sadness into the Coming Rain is a record of this social process, which has always hinged on the fragility of hope. The existential world of the people I photograph is located in an unforgiving environment where life is precarious: little or no rain, scarce water and food, people abandoned by their government and forced to migrate to flee the emptiness ... Their only anchor is the expectation that life will persist against these odds.”After studying art and photography in South Africa, Margaret Courtney-Clarke spent the next four decades working as a photographer in Italy, the US and across Africa.Rena Effendi, born in 1977 in Baku, Azerbaijan, based in Istanbul, TurkeySeries: Transylvania: Built on Grass, 2012“For centuries, the small villages in Transylvania have preserved their hay meadows, raised cattle and operated self-sustainable farms. The agrarian fairytale extinct in western Europe still exists here, in bucolic scenes where young boys learn to cut and rake hay by hand, where all village women know how to weave and all men can build a house from scratch. In this old world, defined by traditional belief systems and respect for the environment, one does not trample a meadow of high grass before mowing it, the cows and horses find their way home along the muddy village tracks and the rivers’ water is busy with the milling, washing and alcohol making.”“Having survived the collectivisation of Ceausescu’s communist regime, this fragile rural environment now faces the modern threat of industrialisation and globalisation as a result of Romania’s 2007 entry into the European Union. This world is on the brink of extinction, as local small-scale farmers cannot compete with the European imports and industrialised agricultural production, and as youngsters leave the countryside in search for work in the cities of western Europe.”Born in Azerbaijan, Rena Effendi lives and works in Istanbul, Turkey. Educated as a linguist, Effendi’s early work focused on the oil industry’s effects on people’s lives in her region.Lucas Foglia, born in 1983 in the US, based in San Francisco“Conservationists often disagree about how humankind should best move forward from the damage it has already done. Traditionalists argue we should put a boundary around wild spaces to preserve them, but there is no way to contain the effects of people. More radical conservationists propose moving all people to green cities, supplied with renewable energy and sustainable agriculture, to allow the countryside to re-wild itself.”“Responding to this debate, I befriended and photographed people who are working towards a positive environmental future despite the enormity of the task. Human Nature is a series of interconnected stories about our reliance on the natural world and the science that fosters our relationship to it. Each story is set in a different ecosystem: city, forest, farm, desert, ice field, ocean and lava flow. From a newly built rainforest in urban Singapore to a Hawaiian research station measuring the cleanest air on Earth, the photographs examine our need for ‘wild’ places – even when those places are human constructions.”Lucas Foglia grew up on a farm in New York and currently lives in San Francisco. His third book, Human Nature, was recently published by Nazraeli Press.Janelle Lynch, born in 1969 in the US, based in New YorkSeries: Another Way of Looking at Love, 2015-2018“This series explores the interconnectedness of all life forms and supports a renewal of human relationships to each other, and to the natural and the spiritual worlds.For some images, I create points of connection with elements from the same species – Japanese barberry or burdock, for example – while for others, I combine multiple species, such as goldenrod and pokeweed or burning bush and pine trees. Points of connection create spaces, which represent areas where new realities can be envisioned. The depiction of unity, together with colour and light, show the beauty and magic of the natural world.”“Another Way of Looking at Love follows the belief that in our organic and spiritual essence, we are inextricably linked to each other and to Mother Nature ... Our wellness and the well-being of the world depend on healthy connections to each other and to the earth.”Janelle Lynch is an American large-format photographer investigating themes of absence, presence, transcendence and the life cycle through the landscapes and waterways of the US, Mexico and Spain.Ross McDonnell, born 1979 in Ireland, based in New YorkLimbs shows a set of improvised prosthetic legs that the artist captured at the International Committee of the Red Cross orthopedic hospital in Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan. Patients who came to receive their new custom fitted limb often would leave their old one behind. They were kept at the hospital and displayed on the wall. One health worker said: “It would be impossible to count the number of people who have lost limbs as a result of conflict in Afghanistan.”The hospital serves the semi-permanent battle space that has come to define eastern Afghanistan throughout the country’s 40 years of near-continuous conflict. For McDonnell, Limbs served to anthropomorphise the resilience and optimism of the Afghan people he spent years documenting.Ross McDonnell is a film-maker and photographer from Dublin, Ireland. McDonnell’s work in long-term documentary projects focuses on themes of sustainability, conflict, migration and ecology.Gideon Mendel, born 1959 in South Africa, based in LondonSeries: Damage: A Testament of Faded Memory, 2016“These images emerge from a time of hope, activism and tragedy. In the 1980s, I was part of a young generation of ‘struggle photographers’ in South Africa, documenting the fight against apartheid. In 1990 I left a box of my outtakes (negatives and transparencies) in storage in Johannesburg, and forgot about it.

It was a moment where the hegemony and power of the apartheid state seemed insurmountable in all its brutality, yet in response there was such heroic idealism within the township mobilisation that I witnessed.”Gideon Mendel began photographing in the 1980s, during the final years of apartheid.

At times she was engulfed in dust, whipped up as the driver dumped mounds of stone and parts of her house beside her, but she refused to move. Slowly they found the remains of her sister and niece, who had been killed when the house was flattened by an airstrike in the final weeks of a battle to defeat Isis in Mosul in the summer of 2017.”“The levels of violence and killing I witnessed while doing this work were beyond comprehension. During the two years I spent documenting the battle to defeat Isis and its aftermath in Iraq and Syria, I struggled to see the high cost of the war as anything but disastrous. In Mosul alone, the death toll was estimated to be more than 9,000 and vast tracts of the city were left in ruins. However, I also saw glimmers of hope for humanity amid the rubble-strewn aftermath. Meeting Nadhira was one of those moments.”Based in the region since 2009, Ivor Prickett documented the Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt and Libya, working simultaneously on editorial assignments and his own long-term projects.Robin Rhode, born 1976 in South Africa, based in BerlinSeries: Principle of Hope, 2017“These disenfranchised youths have become my studio assistants and collaborators in this unique art-making process. The walls are painted in brightly coloured palettes to trigger psychological perception and to embrace mathematics and geometry as an educative tool to assist in developing reason and logic in the minds of young people.”The Berlin-based multidisciplinary artist engages in a variety of visual languages such as photography, performance, drawing and sculpture using materials such as soap, charcoal, chalk and paint.Awoiska van der Molen, born 1972 in the Netherlands, based in Amsterdam“When I came across the phrase ‘Im schwarzen Himmelsrund’ in the composer Gustav Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde, it immediately struck me as the perfect title for a selection of my photo works. Himmelsrund, which literally translates as the heavens’ rim, was used in the middle ages to refer to the celestial firmament as a vaulted disc. This juxtaposition of the ine and the astronomic resonates with my process and my constant quest as a photographer, since my solitary journeys in nature resemble those of the classic pilgrim or anchorite. We share that sense of hope present in alchemist, spiritual and even Christian beliefs, a conviction that there must be a higher plane of existence to which humanity once had access, but with which it lost substantive contact.”“Since the start of my artistic practice 16 years ago , my aim has always been to try to get as close as possible to some true, unspoilt core of a place. By peeling off all the many layers of today’s roaring world, I slowly eliminate all distractions in order to hear, see and experience my surroundings with clean senses.”Awoiska van der Molen is a Dutch artist working with the medium of photography.Alexia Webster, born 1979 in South Africa, based in New York“All the years I was growing up, hanging in the hallway of my childhood home in South Africa was an old black-and-white photograph of my grandparents, my great uncles and my mother as a toddler, posing in a photographer’s studio. They were recent economic migrants to South Africa from a small village on a little island in Greece. I would stare for hours at the photograph, my grandparents looking young and glamorous, dressed in their finest at my three-year-old mother, sitting obediently with curls in her hair at the studio painted backdrop of a misty romantic scene. Although they had just left their whole world behind in search of a better life, to me they looked like elegant characters from a tale my grandmother would tell. This family photograph, of all the images I have, is my most treasured.”“First created in March 2011, the Street Studios project is a communal family photo album that began with the set-up of free outdoor photographic studios on more than 20 street corners and public spaces around the world. In each community we visited, we created public photo studio sets and invited any passing families and iniduals to pose for a portrait. With thousands of photographs taken over almost an eight-year period, Street Studios is an archive of family and love, an archive that documents not what makes things fall apart but what keeps them together.”Alexia Webster is a South African photographer and visual artist.

The college will lend the skeleton so it can be seen alongside Stubbs’s anatomical studies of horses and his paintings of Eclipse.It will be the biggest Stubbs exhibition for 35 years, showing at the new-look MK Gallery in Milton Keynes this autumn.Anthony Spira, the gallery’s director, said there were pressing reasons for doing a Stubbs show in 2019. He said the artist was “one of the most forensic and empathetic chroniclers” of nature.Spira added: “It feels really urgent to look at the natural world. We’re living at a time of extinction, species are disappearing every day and what better guide than George Stubbs to remember how to appreciate the natural world.”Stubbs is known as a brilliant painter of horses but he was much more, said Spira. “He did the most extraordinary anatomical drawings, he was known as the Liverpudlian Leonardo … he was a genuine artist-scientist.”The show will include what were groundbreaking and forensic drawings of horses made during an intense 18-month period of dissection and classification. Little-known anatomical studies of humans will also feature. Horses will take centre stage, including the rare loan by the National Gallery of Stubbs’s best known work, Whistlejacket.The exhibition is a sign of the ambition of the gallery, which reopened in March after a £12m revamp, doubling its size. It will come after the current Paula Rego show, which was given a five-star review by the ’s Adrian Searle.Spiro said the gallery wanted to have a mix of contemporary and historical shows. “The idea of having an old master in a modern setting is very exciting,” he said. “I think there is something very contemporary about Stubbs’ work, about the cropping and the backdrops and the plain backgrounds and that idea of empathy with the natural world.“He had an excitement about discovering the natural world and the animal kingdom that is at complete odds with where we are today. It feels very urgent to appreciate how vulnerable and valuable the natural world is.”The show will also include depictions by Stubbs of cheetahs, lemurs and his remarkable painting of a rhinoceros that was exhibited in 18th-century Britain.After Milton Keynes, a version of the show will tour to the Mauritshuis art museum in The Hague for the first Stubbs exhibition in the Netherlands.• George Stubbs: All Done from Nature is at the MK Gallery from 11 October to 26 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e90552dd881cb8a819e0326202a8cb3f2b719418/0_438_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7336b68cb28a9993b28d0cc30a9b914","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The Hong Kong protests, Cori Gauff at Wimbledon, Pride in New York and the Fourth of July celebrations – the last seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d4f21b581339e35641878c71e20c61a03590c74/0_72_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fe7ae798f4ed402cde130ea202b3bea","title":"irish family darragh hyde anthony hyde christine hyde allowed to stay in australia","story":"Minister intervenes in the case of Australian-born Darragh Hyde, 3, who has cystic fibrosisAn Irish family facing deportation because their Australian-born son was considered a “burden” on the health system have been offered a last-minute reprieve.Anthony and Christine Hyde, and their son Darragh, 3, who has cystic fibrosis, were granted a ministerial intervention on Friday, after their pending deportation caused outrage across the country.The family moved to Australia in 2009 and have been fighting to stay on since 2015, when it emerged that Darragh’s condition prevented him from passing the medical assessment for those applying for permanent residency.Darragh relies on the drug Kalydeco to survive, which costs $300,000 a year but is subsidised under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Costs associated with treatment cannot exceed $40,000 a year under Australian migration law.If they were forced to leave, the Hydes were concerned they would have to wait at least a year before Darragh could access the drug in Ireland.“Late yesterday evening we received the good news that we were granted residency,” Christine Hyde said in a blog post.“We are so excited, a huge weight has been lifted and we can continue our lives. We … are completely grateful to everyone!”The family’s bridging visa was due to expire on 18 June, but they were told a few days earlier that the immigration minister, David Coleman, had decided to review their case.On Friday, Coleman finally intervened and allowed the family to stay on. He said he would not comment on an inidual case.The government had faced significant pressure to intervene. More than 120,000 people signed a petition to let the Hydes stay, and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, had called on the federal government to show the family mercy.The Hydes lives in the Victorian town of Seymour, where Christine works as an assistant principal.

As a film adaptation is released, he asks how much has really changedBoris Johnson was still a backbench Conservative MP and Donald Trump was a property developer and reality television star in the summer that Greetings from Bury Park was published. It was June 2007. I was 36, a journalist and broadcaster living in London. The world I worked in was white, middle-class and metropolitan – a long way from the world in which I had been raised. I had grown up in Luton, the working-class son of Pakistani parents. My father arrived in Britain in 1963 and my mother followed 11 years later with their three children. I was almost three years old. Bury Park was the Asian district of Luton, and my father worked on the production line at the Vauxhall car factory while my mother was a seamstress at home. My childhood was defined by a lack of money and a vivid awareness that my future was limited by my class and my colour. When I managed to get to university and build a career in the media, it became apparent that what I had considered an ordinary upbringing was very different from those of the people I worked among.It was also striking that I never saw lives like mine depicted in popular culture or in books. Working-class lives, Muslim lives, lives defined by their apparent ordinariness. When I started working on a memoir, I did so with the ambition of opening up the world in which I had been raised. I pictured my mother, Rasool Bibi, walking along a street in Bury Park in her traditional shalwar kameez. What would a white person, someone who could not speak Urdu, think of her? What questions would they wish to ask her if they could? I set about writing my book with the hope that by writing very specifically I might tell a more universal story. Perhaps it was possible that sharing my family’s history would help to normalise this immigrant tale, and confirm that stories like ours belonged within the larger narrative of British history.The book was, at its heart, the story of a brown boy who desperately wanted to belong. I grew up at a time when racist football fans would run through Bury Park smashing shop windows and abusing anyone who happened to be on the street. My parents would warn me to get home before kick-off in case things kicked off. On television I would watch Tory politicians such as Norman Tebbit question the loyalty of folks who looked like me. White boys would urinate through the letterbox of my friend Amolak’s home. The suggestion that, being brown-skinned and Muslim, I would never be fully British, was reinforced by my own parents. My father would tell me that Pakistan was my true home even though I had left before I was three. He would say that white people would never accept me – there was no point in trying to integrate because I would never belong. Whenever I told myself or others that I was British, there was a nagging sense that I was a fraud. My right to say I belonged in this country felt fragile.It was not until the election of Tony Blair in 1997 that this fragility began to be replaced with some sense of ease and confidence. I vividly remember the Observer headline on the first weekend of the Blair government, declaring “Goodbye Xenophobia”. Nine months after Blair was elected, indie band Cornershop were No 1 in the singles charts with “Brimful of Asha”, a song about a female Bollywood singer. The old certainties seemed to be giving way to exciting new possibilities. By the time Greetings from Bury Park was published, I was convinced that the arc of British history was bending towards tolerance. I was wrong.The book was welcomed as an insight into the identity struggles for second generation British Muslims. After the 911 attacks there had been a spate of books – notably The Islamist by Ed Husain – that sought to understand Islamic radicalisation through personal stories. My story was also about rock music, specifically Bruce Springsteen (one of whose albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, inspired the title), which meant that it attracted readers new to books about the migrant experience. From a young age, I had sought escape in the work of American writers, television shows and in particular Springsteen’s music. His songs reflected a working-class experience that echoed mine. He sang about fathers and sons with an honesty and empathy that made me reflect on my own relationship with my father. He also articulated a generous version of American patriotism that suggested the US was an inclusive and welcoming place. In America they hardly knew what Muslims were, I told myself, and had most likely never heard of Pakistan. If life in Britain became unbearable, there was always the US.And then came 911. In its aftermath my love for America waned. In the book I recount a conversation with Amolak, in which we resigned ourselves to the reality being over of the days when Americans barely knew what Muslims were. Yet, one year after Greetings from Bury Park was published, Barack Obama, then a state senator from Illinois, became the Democratic party’s nominee for president. His victory that year restored my faith. The Obama presidency was confirmation, it seemed at the time, that in the US anyone could fulfil their dreams, even someone born to a Kenyan Muslim.The film option to my book was sold in 2012. It is hard to process how much the world has changed in the seven years since. The film, Blinded by the Light, will be released in August. Directed by Gurinder Chadha, of Bend It Like Beckham fame, and adapted by me, with Chadha and her husband Paul Mayeda Berges as co-writers, it is fictional but emotionally autobiographical. It stays loyal to the heart and soul of my book. The story is about identity and belonging, about parents and children and how we children of immigrants wish to stand on our own feet without trampling on our parents’ hearts. It is also the story of the racism of my childhood and the possibility of change. I had hoped that the tales of my teenage years would, with each year, read more and more like a dispatch from a long gone era. Younger readers would greet them with horrified fascination and a renewed gratitude for how much things had changed. It turns out that things have not changed as much as I had hoped. The old fragility has returned.In the 12 years between my book being published and the film made, xenophobia has not only returned, it has become normalised. The racism that hovered ominously in the background of my teenage life, and sometimes in the foreground, has returned. In the days after a man ploughed into worshippers outside a mosque in Finsbury Park in 2017, only minutes from where I live, I had to take my daughter on a different route to her violin lesson, so she wouldn’t see the aftermath of the attack. In my teenage years it was the National Front who marched through my hometown now it is Britain First and the English Defence League. Tommy Robinson, another son of Luton, who founded the EDL, is welcomed into Ukip and Johnson, the man who may be our next prime minister, freely uses mocking language about Muslim women who wear niqabs. The right of anyone who is not white to say they are fully British is once again being challenged.So how will the film look to viewers today? Will the message of hope still resonate here, or in the US, where the election of Trump has overturned the happy ending of the Obama years? When it premiered at the Sundance festival, the film landed one of the biggest deals, for $15m from Warner Bros. Earlier this year I flew to Hollywood, Las Vegas and New York to attend preview screenings, and the responses of those who saw it were fascinating. After the Hollywood screening, a young woman approached me and told me she was raised in a Baptist community in Tennessee and had wanted to chase a dream of being a singer songwriter but her parents disapproved. “Your story was my story,” she told me. In New York I met a couple who had come for the Springsteen plotline, but had been affected by the story of a boy wanting to belong. They said they did not know anyone Muslim, but that I was “basically just a Pakistani version” of them.We are living in a time when many of the battles I believed had been won are having to be refought. But the strongest weapon against those who seek to sow ision is empathy. That this film is being made now, that it will reach audiences who haven’t read the book, gives me a reason to feel hopeful.• Greetings from Bury Park by Sarfraz Manzoor is published by Bloomsbury.

Time passed languishing in hospital, parents orced, adolescent despair held me in its grip. One thing was for sure: these villages and their inhabitants were stuck, and slipping into the past. Life, the future, lay elsewhere.I left school at 16 and dossed about in a depressive state, alternating dead-end jobs with the dole. Yet also reading most of the Russian novels of the 19th and early 20th century that were translated into English, and inching towards an accommodation with this mortal existence.I wandered around Europe, wrote desultory poems about superfluous young men in Munich, Paris, Rome lived in Wales moved to Oxford. Then one day in my late 20s I began to write a story. For some reason I set it in the Teign Valley. And in front of my eyes the villages of my adolescence burst into flame.The boys and girls I’d known – scrappers, drinkers, dreamers, jokers – I realised I loved them all. The farmers, labourers, madwomen, priest, hedge-layer, impoverished aristocrat, army veteran who wished to be addressed by his rank: there they all were.I knew this world in my bones. The sound of that donkey in the field below the church. The smell of tarmac in the sun. Stuart’s mum calling him in for tea, a small woman whose voice carried across canyons. The tiny sweetshop in an elderly brother and sister’s front room. The single Catholic family who walked to church in Chudleigh. The war memorial, commemorating those lost in the wars of 1914-1919 and 1939-1946. A lone heron that kept vigil over the flooded quarry.I revisited the valley and discovered that the gloomy vale of childhood was, in reality, incredibly beautiful. The lovely River Teign flows between lush fields. Primroses abound. Haldon Forest rises on one side, Dartmoor on the other, up beyond the reservoirs.So my first novel, In the Place of Fallen Leaves, was born. The village became, in the writing, a microcosm of England in the 1980s, convulsed by Thatcherite greed and indifference to others. Characters either let themselves be swept along or stood firm, for community, nature, love.Unable to leave Oxford and return to live in Devon, I wrote a further seven novels set in various times and places. Until a longing for the landscape and people I’m from drew me back, to write a trilogy of novels set 100 years ago in Somerset, Devon and Cornwall about two childhood friends, a silent farm boy and an aristocratic horsewoman, and how their lives twist and turn.

Belfast, Teesside and Aberdeen are among potential locations. A US congressional report in 2013 estimated there were 3,500 free ports across 135 countries, hosting tax-free zones ning from car production to fine art storage.One of those zones, and a potential model for the UK’s post-Brexit future, can be found at the end of a motorway, in a warehouse backing on to Luxembourg airport.This is no ordinary warehouse: Le Freeport is a maximum security centre for the super-rich to store art, fine wine, vintage cars and other treasures. Roughly the size of three football pitches, Le Freeport has four bullion chambers, space for 750,000 bottles of wine, and airport landing bays designed for armoured vehicles.The squat four-storey building is designed to look like a jewellery box, not an obvious feature to the casual viewer looking through the barbed wire fence and metal gates.The interior is said to be luxurious, with chic rooms for wealthy clients to arrange sales or simply contemplate their treasures within the confines of the thick walls. “It is more akin to a contemporary art museum than a warehouse,” says David Arendt, former managing director of Le Freeport.The draw for super-rich clients is not having to pay import taxes, VAT or capital gains tax on anything stored or sold within its confines. Promoters say clients benefit from lower insurance premiums and the easy access to the airport tarmac.The opening of Le Freeport in 2014 – to capitalise on the dash for safer assets after the financial crisis – was not universally welcomed in Luxembourg. A local group of artists, Richtung 22, wrote and performed a satirical play about what its spokeswoman Ada Günther calls a “fortress for art”. The play also took aim at what the authors see as the government’s aim to make the Grand Duchy “a haven for the super-rich from other countries”, Günther said.Doubts mushroomed in 2015 when the Swiss businessman and majority shareholder in Le Freeport, Yves Bouvier, was arrested on charges of defrauding clients by misrepresenting the value of artworks. Bouvier, who owns a stake in the Geneva free port and created the Singapore free port, denies all charges and legal cases are ongoing.In response to the furore, the Luxembourg government tightened anti-money-laundering controls. Since 2015 the three logistics firms licensed to work in Le Freeport have been obliged to keep records of the beneficial owner of property stored in the warehouse. Luxembourg customs officers inspect everything that arrives through the doors.“In 2015, the government decided to evaluate the free port in Luxembourg and came to the conclusion that there were indeed money-laundering risks,” said Djuna Bernard, co-president of Luxembourg’s Green party in a statement.The European parliament thinks Le Freeport remains a money-laundering risk. “Everything is very opaque and murky,” says Ana Gomes, a Portuguese socialist who stood down as an MEP this week. Gomes, a former member of the parliament’s special committee on tax evasion, visited Le Freeport in February 2018, but remains unconvinced by its controls.Gomes thinks Luxembourg police and tax authorities do not have adequate access to the data collected by the logistics firms working in Le Freeport. “It is a major scheme to evade paying taxes, to avoid money-laundering controls,” she alleges.Luxembourg’s Indirect Tax Office (AED) found Le Freeport to be “high risk in relation to money laundering”, according to evidence collected by the European parliament.Le Freeport has strongly rejected the allegations. “The claims that Le Freeport could be used for money laundering andor the concealment of stolen art are absurd and without factual basis,” said a company representative. “Le Freeport is probably the most controlled storage place in the European Union.”Companies working at Le Freeport also say strict laws have cost them clients.The unexpected introduction of anti-money-laundering rules put Le Freeport at a “competitive disadvantage”, one Freeport logistics operator told the European parliament. “Clients like their privacy and are thus reluctant to provide their data. The same goes for merchants and dealers,” said the operator, who estimated Luxembourg’s tougher rules cost them up to 30 clients, who went to rivals with “more discretion”.There are dozens of free ports inside the European Union, but all have to abide by EU law, including an update of anti-money-laundering rules that comes into force in 2020, obliging free ports to carry out due diligence on clients.There are 80 free ports in EU member state territories and their dependencies. This includes a free port on the Isle of Man, the British crown dependency, which is neither part of the EU nor the UK.After Brexit or a Brexit transition period, the UK would no longer be obliged to follow EU anti-money-laundering rules. But free port critics argue the UK would pay a price for abandoning EU standards. “If politicians in Britain think Britain should go rogue in financial services, yes it makes sense to have a free port, but I don’t think it is something good in the long run for the reputation of Britain,” said Gomes.If Brussels deems British tax loopholes excessive, the UK could forfeit access to European markets, or even end up on a tax blacklist, she added. “If that is the way for Britain after Brexit, if so, there are no shortage of ways in which the EU can react.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25667802b6a67df5486cdfad7cc88eedc287b62a/5_47_1746_1048/master/1746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46876c6d3d30d7795d0738bbcef1d7f7","title":"the colour and calm of copenhagen a cartoon","story":"The Illustrated City: Danish capital is spirited and busy but there are nooks of tranquillity, says urban sketcher João AlbergariaA popular square in the centre of a multicultural neighbourhood, Nørrebro, Blågårds Plads hosts street markets, concerts and demonstrations. It is considered something of an alternative location, a bit out of the context of the city, partly because of the large communities of Arab and African people in the area.There are also many stores that sell secondhand or recycled products.It is a very busy area, but the trees lend the square tranquillity, projecting fantastic shadows on the pavement.It was the start of spring and lots of people were outside enjoying the weather – I tried to capture the spirit of the crowded square and the beautiful light.Frederiksholms Kanal is the largest artificial canal built in the centre of Copenhagen in the 17th century. Along the canal are landmark buildings of Copenhagen – Christiansborg palace, parliament, the National Museum – as well as old warehouse buildings, beautiful bridges and hundreds of boats.In this particular scene, what struck me most were the vivid colours of the boats against the surroundings on a winter’s day.During Denmark’s long, dark winter, life in the boats stops and they are left alone until the springtime weather arrives.This 360-degree view means a lot to me. I worked in the area for three years and this drawing was done in several days. Every day I did a small part and it was a challenge because I needed to connect all the parts together.There are several important buildings in the drawing, such as Nikolaj Kunsthal, parliament, the National Museum, Museum Thorvaldsen and Christiansborg palace.It was a privilege to work in the Gammel Strand area. It is a very old part of the city with remarkably beautiful buildings. The name means the old beach, and is where the fish market used to be.Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (New Carlsberg) is a Danish art museum founded by Carl Jacobsen and opened to the public in 1906. It is one of the most important museums of Copenhagen, with a big collection of classic works and contemporary art. I have wandered around the exhibits many times, but this time I thought I should honour the beautiful orange building.It is always crowded, but has a wonderful patio inside with palm trees.In the summer there are lots of tourists in the city, who always head straight to the museums and places indicated on tourist maps and travel websites. The areas between Tivoli (Europe’s oldest entertainment park), Glytoptek and Central Station are always full of tourists. I like to observe the new visitors to the city I find their reactions and movements amusing.On the day I sketched this, it was quite hot and I just wanted to stay for ever on the street to enjoy this rare (for Copenhagen) weather.It is easy to imagine stories when drawing, and I often imagine the lives of the people who built the buildings, the challenges, the empty spaces that are being completed.HC Andersens Boulevard is one of the main streets of Copenhagen, with a mix of old and new buildings. I really enjoy sketching old buildings with lots of decoration. It makes me focused – it’s like putting a puzzle together.This building is imposing and I always wonder about what is going on inside. I do not know if people live there, or whether it is offices or something else entirely. This mystery keeps my imagination active.This harbour is in an area where the new city is expanding. Lots of new, vulgar and misguided, construction is springing up. This drawing was a kind of tribute to a big effort made by residents to keep the harbour small and less developed and to the memory of a place that is in the process of disappearing.I always like to find places to draw where there is some controversy or discussion about the place. In this case, little remains of the spirit of the original harbour it has become artificial with horrible new edifices around it.It is sad that part of the history of the city is disappearing. I think the boats that remain are magical. Some of them have become like exclusive and expensive hotels, but there is still a small remnant of port life – only very little, but something survives. I really appreciate this effort.Like all the central stations in Europe’s big capital cities, it’s a peculiar place, with lots of people coming and going.The roof is made of a beautiful wood structure supported by stone columns.It was an extremely cold day, and even though I was drawing indoors I had to wear lots of layers of clothing, which affected my sketching skills and agility.A city’s central station is a place where momentous things happen. It is a place of meetings and disagreements of new beginnings and departures.I made this sketch on the rooftop of Rundetaarn, one of the highest spots of the city. Copenhagen is a flat city and most of the buildings don’t have more than five or six floors I like how towers make it possible to pick out the different squares and locations.The light was beautiful on that summer’s day.I decided to go to the top of the tower a bit by chance. The tower building itself is rather ugly and uninteresting, but I thought the view could be interesting. And it was – that magnificent view over Copenhagen and that intense light. From the top of the tower you can see all the significant landmarks. Steeples and high roofs that are normally attached to important city buildings, such as churches, City Hall and other civil buildings, are located in squares. So using that as a starting point, it is possible to read the layout of the whole city. The towers link the axes of the city, marking the key points of entry to the old city.Palæ is an emblematic bar of Copenhagen. There was a great jazz concert in the day I did the sketch and at the end the musicians wanted to sign my original drawing. What a honour.The space was crowded but I was lucky and got a place right in front of the musicians. From up close you can feel their expressive intensity, see the head movements, long moments with closed eyes. It was a great opportunity to draw the scene.The logo of the cafe is brilliant: a reference to the little mermaid, one of the symbols of the city.Sydhavn is a beautiful harbour outside the city centre. Is it still a fishing harbour and also has a lot of old boat houses. It is my favourite spot to sketch in Copenhagen I feel at home and welcomed by the people who live there.Sydhavn is an oasis in the city, an old fishing port lost in the greatly expanding new city of Copenhagen.More than being just an old fishing port, Sydhavn has the soul of alternative dimension: people who live there seem completely apart from the accelerated rhythm of the rest of the city. The atmosphere in Sydhavm has a different rhythm I cannot identify a trace of stress.Going to Sydhavn to draw works like therapy for me when I have had one of those days of intense and stressful work.There is a huge pressure of real estate investors to destroy the port and build those blocks of horrible apartments that look the same wherever you are in the world.But for now, drawing the boats of Sydhanvn is a great pleasure: I love to unravel their secrets and memories. The boats speak for themselves they have souls and they survive.Tivoli is the oldest amusement park in Europe and the Danish are extremely proud of it. Drawing symbols of the city is always a challenge and a huge responsibility. I tried to get the overall view of the building and then used a fish-eye perspective, which gives an expressive dynamic grammar to a drawing.Vaenedamsvej is one of the busiest shopping streets in Vesterbro: huge cafes and shops that sell almost everything line up one after the other. Residents of Copenhagen go to this street to buy things they need but also to relax. There is a dynamism in the shops and cafes, nothing is boring. There are bicycles everywhere and the cafes put tables outside once the weather improves.Also, for me, the bikes in the foreground are an icon of the city.I like the ersity of the building on the city corner it makes the city feel alive, and it is easy to see lots of things happening at once because of the dynamic of the location.I often like to look for nooks and crannies to draw, and in Vesterbro you can find a lot of them.This place where Viktoriagade crosses Vesterbrogade is particularly interesting for its architectural ersity. Here, several buildings of different epochs and proportions are connected.João Paulo Albergaria is a Portuguese architect who has lived in Copenhagen since 2012.

The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg is doing a live piece to camera from Downing Street, when an upper window of No 10 opens behind her. As she speaks, bin bags full of Boris Johnson’s clothes begin to be thrown from it, punctuated by various high-pitched reflections on his character. Like I say, it’s just a fictional vignette, set 10 minutes into a dystopian future. But would you honestly rule it out? Just over a fortnight before the money shot of the Tory leadership contest, very little seems impossible in our increasingly trashy country.After all, this is a week in which England – and it is always England – has once again been embarrassed by the behaviour of travelling fans. Fans of Nigel Farage, in this case, with the spectacle of his Brexit party MEPs turning their backs on a live performance of the European anthem at the opening of the new European parliament session in Strasbourg. We have seen it so many times before, of course – this pack mentality, this unprovoked loutishness, this excruciatingly entitled sense that it is acceptable, even imperative, to colonise a public space and behave absurdly rudely in it.However, we have hitherto tended to see it outside a designated bar in, say, the old port in Marseille, one day before a football international, rather than in the debating chamber of a 28-state parliament. In terms of intellect, deliberate offence and filthy manners, there really is nothing to choose between a shirtless England fan singing 10 German Bombers while threatening to chuck some cafeteria furniture, and Ann Widdecombe ranting at MEPs that Brexit was comparable to slaves rising up against their owners.Back home, thanks to this necrotic country’s absolute commitment to providing its own metaphors, we learn that there is an acute burial crisis in the UK. We need new ideas for how to dispose of our rising count of corpses, says a leading public health expert, who recommends burying them alongside motorways. Still, at least one tomb has surely been vacated by Widders, that hard-right Havisham, whose desiccated bigotry and cobwebbed inhumanity has been exhumed with her election as a Brexit party MEP, as well as reminding us that the border between Celebrity Big Brother and public service is basically nonexistent. There really is something of the shite about her.Widdecombe is naturally regarded as a huge asset by her party leader, who has long been the red item in the UK’s white wash. Farage loves to perpetuate a certain image of himself, deliberately wearing tweed suits even in Washington DC and so on. He repetitively harks back to some bygone era, when the stereotypical Englishman abroad was the model of urbanity. Alas, as anyone who’s been on a late-night Ryanair flight will agree, this is no longer the stereotype. Farage might imagine he’s cosplaying as David Niven, but stunts such as the one in Strasbourg should remind us he is in fact just another big-drinking Brit who might as well be pissing in a European street on a stag weekend.Bad manners, unprovoked aggression, going through the non-EU passport queue even though you don’t yet have to – all these are clear elements of the emerging Brexit style. For former newspaper the Daily , Johnson is its most exquisite embodiment. “Mr Johnson IS Mr Brexit,” declared its leader column today. “He is also a triumph of a very British kind of style as well as substance – and what is wrong with that?” Guys, I know you’ve only had 30 years of warning, but you’re going to kick yourself when you find out.Then again, you don’t even have to be in frontline politics to feel that Johnson’s your route to a job. The Times story about George Osborne’s bid to become IMF president features the following crystallisation of British public life: “Mr Osborne will need the nomination of Britain’s next prime minister to succeed. The Evening Standard, which he edits, recently endorsed Boris Johnson in the leadership race.”The Financial Times unearthed further horror in its report that Johnson could call a snap general election. Or as one of his backers chose to put it: “He could say ‘I’m the daddy’.” I can picture at least three discrete settings in which Johnson might indeed say those words, each of them more grotesque than the last. But it’s unclear quite what else they expect, when Johnson currently exists in the shadows, like a late-era Brando playing Struwwelpeter.That said, the one thing we do know is that Johnson is less unkempt than he was. It’s genuinely remarkable how many of the wanky articles on “The New Johnson” a) can only be responded to with the exhortation “wake the fuck up”, and b) contain extensive extrapolative reference to the fact he’s had a haircut. I mean, well done to the manscaped Dulux dog and everything. But could the bar honestly be any lower? I fully expect to read he’s been housebroken in recent weeks.For now, the prime-minister-in-waiting is still having little irony-related accidents. Or as his sign-off to today’s Darlington hustings ran: “If only we could see ourselves as others see us.” If only indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0f566a64fd45349b6aeff1f12f0c5b3c84e4929/0_109_1530_918/master/1530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=880c9792cfd7eaf8458af6405089c50c","title":"britains story empire based myth need know truth","story":"These days we’ve become wearily accustomed to depictions of Brexit Britain as oppressed by a villainously imperial Europe. Annexed “without permission”, Nigel Farage claimed melodramatically, defending Brexit party MEPs against charges of “disrespecting” the European Parliament. In a particularly far-fetched comparison, Ann Widdecombe MEP has compared Brexit with the resistance of “slaves against their owners” and “colonies against empires”. Prime ministerial frontrunner Boris Johnson too has spoken of Britain’s supposed “colony status” in the EU though, with a familiar double standard, he also believes that it would be good if Britain was still “in charge” of Africa.These bizarre comparisons can be made and go unchallenged because the stark fact remains that most Britons know very little about the history of the empire itself, still less the way in which its long afterlife profoundly shapes both Britain and the wider world today.Most students would welcome this move. Mine often tell me, regretfully, how little they were taught about the empire at school or, when it was addressed at all, how selectively. They want to know more and to know the truth. While some Conservative politicians, such as former schools secretary Michael Gove, have also stressed the need to teach the British empire, their preference is for mythology over history, a drums-and-trumpet “island story” in which Britannia munificently scattered “British values” across the globe like so much imperial confetti. The enormous scale of resistance to empire and the terrifying bloodshed it took to quell that resistance are either hidden or deliberately played down.My new book, Insurgent Empire, shows how this resistance and repression influenced another strand of British history few Britons know anything about – criticism of empire and colonialism within Britain itself over centuries. There is much to be proud of here, especially those clear-sighted Britons who refused mythmaking and insisted on solidarity with those at the receiving end of exploitation and dispossession, whatever their skin colour.Brexiter ideology is contradictory. It simultaneously insists on pride in the British empire (accompanied by the delusion that former colonies are eager for a close bond with their erstwhile masters) and stokes harsh anti-immigrant sentiment. The Runnymede Trust’s report, however, points to the simple fact that the history of migration cannot be separated from that of empire. The presence of African, Caribbean and Asian communities in this country is tied to the great and lasting upheavals of British colonialism including economic hardship, land dispossession, ethnic and social cleansing, labour exploitation and wealth loss, often caused by the migration of large numbers of Britons to colonial possessions where they sought to escape poverty in Britain or to enrich themselves further. As late as the 1950s, advertisements were encouraging Britons to move to Kenya for cheap land and farm labour. The British Nationality Act of 1948 was intended mainly to facilitate immigration from the “white” dominions of New Zealand and Australia but also enabled the arrival of black and Asian migrants such as the “Windrush generation” who came here from the Caribbean as British subjects and filled a desperate labour shortage. Some understanding of this backstory would help when black and Asian Britons are asked to account for their presence in Britain as they all too frequently are.Here’s the irony. While discussions of the British empire invariably generate toxic ides, it is in fact this very history that can provide sought-after “common ground” on which to examine the necessarily complex question of what it means to be British today. All Britons, white and ethnic minority, are touched every day by imperial legacies, from what we eat and drink – coffee, cocoa, sugar, tea – to the multinational corporations and banks we work for or buy from, to our basic assumptions and categories of thought including concepts such as race, development, free trade and globalisation which were forged in the crucible of empire. Colonial history also provides context for many contemporary British concerns from identity, multiculturalism and humanitarianism to foreign aid, hard borders and sovereignty.Moreover, the history of the empire shows us not only that there is nothing especially “British” about values such as tolerance, freedom, human rights or democracy but that often what we call “British values” were influenced by both empire and resistance to empire. The oft-told story of a benevolent Britain “bestowing” freedom on her colonies when they were deemed ready for it is largely myth. In reality, resistance, often violent resistance alongside famous non-violent movements, was a central part of the story. Colonial subjects often had their own ideas about the meaning of “freedom” – like the Jamaican rebels of 1865, who rejected the notion that they were “free” to sell their labour to plantation owners after being released from bondage, and demanded small plots of land in which they could be truly independent. “Freedom”, it became clear, has many meanings and today we are often presented with a rather narrow version mainly to do with consumer choice.An honest and informed understanding of the British empire and its afterlife is also vital because it can help us go beyond the questionable model where ethnic and cultural minorities in Britain are required to “integrate” into a static model of “Britishness” owned by white Britons.The enslaved and the colonised were not merely either victims or beneficiaries of empire but agents who actively contributed to Britain. Their labour, often extracted for nothing or little, underlies the wealth that was created in this country, while their resistance to oppression underscored the universality of values such as equality, human dignity, tolerance, justice and freedom. In many ways, they made Britain.• Priyamvada Gopal’s latest book is Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and British Dissent, published last week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317058d7c769c5f606dd37aec27154519b5b5f19/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91dcb43fa8806d44c07f46aa8d8263bc","title":"lonely female football fan england womens world cup team","story":"The huge interest in the England Women’s World Cup team shows that, finally, female involvement in our national sport is normalisedOn Tuesday night, England played the USA in the semi-final of the Women’s World Cup. BBC viewing figures showed that it was the most-watched TV programme this year, with a peak of 11.7 million people tuning in, far more than Britain’s Got Talent. Another 1.7 million watched online. What I love most about this is the normalisation of the women’s game, the normalisation of women reporting and commentating on it, the normalisation of men watching it. Of course there have been those dark corners of Football Twitter where the dinosaurs and losers huddle together for warmth, making jokes about women getting back into the kitchen. The ones who are still stuck in the 1960s.Let’s rewind right back to there. When I was in my teens, the manager of West Ham United, Ron Greenwood, was friendly with my parents. He knew I liked football (I kept quiet about my love of Spurs so as not to cause offence), and was a source of tickets for matches at Upton Park. One Saturday the whole family was invited. My father was whisked off to the boardroom, while my mother and I were ushered into the purdah of the ladies’ lounge with the players’ and directors’ wives. They might as well have shut us away in a drawer out of sight.Fast-forward a few years. “I’ve nothing against women but why must they always infiltrate?” bleated the elderly deputy sports editor of the Observer in 1973 when female journalists made moves to join the male-only Press Club. That was the year I became a football writer. My first match report was Coventry v Spurs. I phoned over my copy in the press room, and when I put the phone down I realised there was absolute silence. All the blokes had been listening. “That was very good,” said the one sitting next to me. He sounded a bit relieved. If truth be told, I felt relieved too. I knew men felt uncomfortable if a woman embarrassed herself. And it was very nice of him to have complimented me. Later, much later, like 40 years on from then, I thought, “What. The. Hell. Who was he to judge how I did my job?” What if the situation had been reversed? What if I’d told this condescending little twit his report was good?“Rather a weird girl,” commented Anthony Howard, an executive editor on the Observer, to my agent, the fierce and wonderful Pat Kavanagh. Pat scoffed at him but I was mortified. As I was when a reporter on the business section swanned up to me in the Cockpit, the Observer’s Saturday night pub. ‘You’re butch, aren’t you?’ he said smarmily. Everybody said I should have told him to fuck off but I was so taken aback I couldn’t say anything. What had I done wrong? Was I guilty of insufficient simpering?It was not until I wrote a film, Those Glory Glory Days (1983), about my childhood love of Spurs, and received letters by the sackful, that I realised there were hundreds of women and girls like me, who passionately loved football but had always been made to feel that it was an outlandish thing for a female to be interested in.Psychologists could explain better than I could why for girls being a player or reporter or supporter is a symbol of freedom. The women who do it just know how it feels. Watching football engages your emotions. Playing it makes you realise who you are. I’m starting work on a book about the pioneers of the women’s game, the ones who were around my age and played in the 1960s. Some Saturdays they couldn’t get a field because the men took the pitches. They had to change on buses or in toilets because there were no dressing rooms. “We just wanted to play,” one said. “I hated running. I still hate it. But when you’re running on the field it’s totally different. Step over that line, you changed. You weren’t a girl. You were a player.”In the mid-1980s I took a 10-year break from Fleet Street to get married, have children and write books and scripts. When I returned to football reporting in the mid-90s, there were a few more of us in the press box. “It’s all your fault,” moaned one of the gentlemen of the press about this lamentable infiltration. “Oh dear, I’m really sorry,” I said. Imagine that. Imagine a man apologising for doing a job.Meanwhile, I heard a familiar voice behind me. “Women in the press box! Pah!” The old crackpot was still going on about it. He was so enraged to see me again he drove a chair into my legs.But back to the 2019 Women’s World Cup. These women look great. They’re confident and uninhibited. They’re not forced to be demure, or expected to make the sandwiches or told to shut up. Football is a kind of universal language. It always was but females were shut out of it and now they aren’t.Meg Rapinoe is the footballer I tuned in for. Rapinoe, who refused to sing the national anthem and said, “I’m not going to the fucking White House”, when asked what would happen if the US team were invited by the sleazy potentate in office. A magnificent two-fingered gesture to the patriarchy. If I was a girl now, she’s the woman I’d want to be. My favourite image of this tournament is the one of her, arms outstretched, triumphant, when she’d scored the second of her two goals in the quarter-final against France. Glorying in being good instead of having to apologise for being there. My hero.• Julie Welch has worked on the Observer as a football reporter from 1973 to 1985.

The law has nurtured several generations of women and girlsOn Sunday, USA will play the final of the Women’s World Cup against the Netherlands, and there’s a good chance the Americans will win. Victory would bring a fourth world title for the US women’s team – there have only been eight World Cup competitions in history.The talent pool for female soccer players in America appears bottomless. The American women are so talented that players who would be starters for other countries, such as the forward Christen Press, frequently find themselves on the bench. The US has found itself with a huge number of phenomenally talented female soccer players: how did we get them?In large part, we got them through policy, in particular the Education Amendments Act of 1972. Shepherded into law by Congresswoman Patsy Mink of Hawaii, the title IX provision of the act was a response to feminists’ push to close a loophole in the Civil Rights Act of 964 that allowed federally funded schools, colleges and universities to discriminate by sex. Title IX was intended to prohibit this kind of discrimination, and it applied to all educational programs and all aspects of a school’s operation – including sports.Title IX was controversial from the beginning. The law was passed when school-based athletics programs for girls were virtually non-existent, and cultural mores and common superstitions alike held that sports and physical competition were the province of men, and unnatural or even unhealthy for girls. Republican senators John Tower of Texas and Jesse Helms of North Carolina were particularly preoccupied with the bill’s mandate that schools fund sports programming for women, introducing multiple amendments to the bill that aimed to exempt athletics departments from the non-discrimination mandate. The amendments failed, but title IX’s sports funding provision faced an uphill battle to implementation – it was gutted by the supreme court in 1984 and had to be re-implemented by Congress in 1988 in an override of Ronald Reagan’s veto. Even then, its enforcement was fought tooth and nail by school administrations and the NCAA.Title IX established a large and unwieldy legal apparatus for schools, colleges and universities, and the purview of that apparatus extends far beyond sports. Taken as a whole, title IX’s success in creating discrimination-free educational environments for women and girls is spotty at best. But the athletic non-discrimination provision has been a massive success in encouraging American girls to play sports.By demanding that schools provide opportunities for young girls to play sports and mandating that universities provide equal scholarship funding for women, title IX created opportunity and incentive for girls to play sports. Suddenly, not only were energetic, athletic girls given the same opportunities to play as the boys were, but they also had the opportunity for their sporting talent to fund their educations through scholarships.Nearly 50 years after title IX became law, a generation of women has reaped the benefits of institutional support, professional development and education that the law provides, and many of them have gone on to successful athletic careers. Those careers were made by policy: title IX effectively turned the American education system into the world’s most successful women’s sporting development organization. The success story of women’s sports under title IX shows how marginalized groups can be given opportunities through policy interventions how the talents and passions of iniduals can be fostered when they have institutional support.When USA faces off against the Netherlands, Americans can cheer not just for the accomplishments of the soccer players on the field, but for the success of a law whose fundamental principle is that women’s and girls’ potential is worth investing in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a65ab1aecb4921457f3db7f7fad29dc0f2d73dd/209_531_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa11d7e78ea045b82e7291ea4af1b48b","title":"share photos of wildflower and planted meadows and verges near you","story":"If you have seen any planted meadows or verges by roads or public spaces, we would like to hear from youBritish conservation charity Plantlife’s campaign to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges has seen some councils take the message seriously.Posting on Twitter, Bex Langley wrote about the eight miles of flowers planted along a major road in Rotherham thanks to the local council.The group’s road verge campaign started in 2013 in response to the mowing down of wildflowers – flowers which are not intentionally seeded or planted.

Upmarket tearoom manager Catia Teixeira does it to avoid chucking freshly baked scones in the bin. And sandwich shop customer Ruoyun Hui wants to save money and the planet.All three are enthusiastic users of Too Good To Go, an app that enables restaurants and cafes to sell food they would otherwise have thrown away – thereby offering customers who care about food waste the chance to grab something cheap to eat and make a difference at the same time. Rock-bottom prices are not unusual: £17 worth of great food for £3.49, anyone?I personally discovered it late one evening, sitting in my local Yo! Sushi restaurant in central Cambridge. The restaurant was starting to close and the conveyor belt, which had been full of delicious-looking, freshly made food, was suddenly completely empty.“Where has all the food gone?” I asked the waitress. Some of it, I was told, would be thrown away, but the restaurant does also use Too Good To Go to get rid of food.After downloading the app, I saw that a dozen restaurants within walking distance were offering “magic bags” of leftover food. Each was apparently worth between £8 and £12, but would cost just £3 to £4.To get a bag, I would have to pay for it through the app – without knowing exactly what would be in it, though there’s a description of what sort of food is sold at that particular place – and agree to collect it during a short window of time allotted by the restaurant.A wide range of scrumptious delights were on offer, from a global food buffet and waffles to croissants, noodles, cakes and sandwiches.But would all this half-price leftover food taste OK? Would I really get good value for money and rescue food from the bin at the same time? Or was Too Good To Go, in fact, too good to be true?I decided to try it out. I bought my first lunch with the app for £3.49 from Cafe Bread \u0026amp Butter, a small cafe not far from the River Cam that I had never been to before, even though it was a short 10-minute stroll from my house.Unfortunately, I could only collect my lunch between 2.30pm and 3.30pm, which meant I was starving by the time I arrived. I also had no choice about what I would be given: it turned out to be a jacket potato with cheese, beans and salad, a packet of salt and pepper crisps (again, I couldn’t choose which flavour) and a strawberry Ribena.Luckily, I love jacket potatoes. And knowing I had rescued perfectly good food from the dumpster seemed to add an extra layer of enjoyment to my meal.I was also impressed by how much food I was given. Normally, that lunch would have cost £6.50, says Boyraz. He signed up with the app three months ago. “I thought stopping food waste sounded like a good idea. People seem to love it.”He mainly sells yesterday’s baked potatoes through the app. “I do it partly because I’m concerned about the environment and want to support people in my local community, but also because in my culture, wasting is not a good thing. I’m Muslim, and in our holy book there is a verse that says: eat, drink – but don’t waste.”The app brings in new customers, he says. Like me, most of the people who purchase food from his cafe via the app have never been in before.A few days later, I collect my next magic bag from Benets Cafe, opposite King’s College Chapel, at 3.30pm. It contains a chicken pesto sandwich and a ham and cheese croissant – and costs just £3.59.At the counter I meet a hard-working university researcher, Ruoyun Hui, collecting her own magic bag. She says she has used the app a handful of times, “usually when I’m busy with work and miss mealtimes”. She does it both to get a bargain and to help stop food waste – and says she’s happy with what she gets. “Most of the time it’s good value.”We are told the food in the bag must be eaten that day, but I put the croissant in the fridge to eat for breakfast the next morning. It tastes just fine.I also visit Harriets Cafe Tearooms, well-known in Cambridge for its afternoon teas. The app says I can collect my magic bag between 5pm and 6pm, but when I turn up just before 6pm, the cafe is locked shut. I bang on the door and show the app through the window, and luckily a waiter opens up and hands me a beautiful box wrapped in ribbon. Not knowing what I would find inside was exciting, and frankly I couldn’t wait to unwrap it.When I do, I find four cheese scones, normally £3.20 for two, and two broken pistachio macaroons, normally £2.10 each. In total this should have cost me £10.60, but I paid £3.49. I share the scones out that evening with friends, and everyone tells me how good they taste. The pistachio macaroons, which I would never normally have bought, are particularly tasty.“Our scones are freshly made every day and, if we don’t sell them, we have to bin them, which is a waste,” says tearoom manager Catia Teixeira a few days later. “We try to make only enough for how busy we think we’re going to be – but if it’s a quiet, sunny day, we may not sell as many as we anticipate.”The cafe used to give leftover food away to local homeless people at closing time, but encountered some problems. “People started coming in the middle of the day, and disturbing the other customers. So we had to stop.”The food on offer through Too Good To Go is undoubtedly very cheap – but since the only way to buy the leftover food is through the app, only customers who own a smartphone can access the magic bags. Then again, the primary aim of this app isn’t to tackle food poverty, but to make sure leftover food gets eaten by someone, regardless of who that is, explains co-founder Jamie Crummie. “Our ultimate goal is to rescue food. It’s about trying to create a solution that is simple, engaging and fun, and change people’s attitudes and perceptions about food waste.”He is hoping the app will help to ease the impact of food production on the environment. “We are trying to make a stand against climate change.”More than 22,000 restaurants and cafes in 11 countries have signed up, and magic bags can be bought in around 120 towns and cities across the UK. Since its launch in 2016, about 15m meals have been rescued through the app, Crummie says. “But that’s just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the amount of food that we need to save.”• Karma Like Too Good To Go, this is another app that hooks up consumers with leftover food in restaurants. But in terms of the UK, only restaurants in London appear to be using it at the moment. It’s also available in Paris and across Sweden.• Olio This is an app that allows you to give away food you don’t want. At the time of writing, only three items were available for collection within 5km of my home in Cambridge: a jar of Ballymaloe relish, some cat food and a couple of espresso pods. However, if I lived in north London, 44 items would be available within 5km.• FoodCloud This app helps charities and community groups – from homeless hostels to breakfast clubs – obtain surplus food from retailers and other companies. Based in Dublin, FoodCloud operates in Ireland and the UK.• Out-of-date food websites such as Approved Food, Clearance XL, Low Price Foods and Star Bargains allow you to buy cheap food online that is either nearing or past its “best before” date (but not, crucially, past its “use by” date). Often you can find amazing bargains on tinned food, crisps, biscuits and rice. Just watch out for the delivery fee - it can be expensive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a7f8723e87af39676edde819dbb07aede3a3736/0_145_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18914719cafe79d9546454d8d74c0781","title":"making a crust tesco to use unsold bread in new products","story":"Supermarket to create olive crostini and bread pudding from baguettes to reduce wasteBritain’s largest supermarket chain is launching a drive to reduce food waste from bread by turning unsold baguettes and batons from its in-store bakeries into new products.Surplus bread is one of the biggest waste problems for food retailers, according to the government’s food waste adviser Wrap, particularly from freshly baked lines which have a short shelf life.Tesco said that, as well as being among the UK’s most popular breads, freshly baked baguettes and batons were among bread items left on its selves at the end of the day. The retailer said it had decided to use the unsold products to make a range of olive crostini and bread pudding which will be launched in 24 stores next week. It estimated the amount of unsold fresh bread could be cut by up to a half if the range was made available at all its outlets.Currently, Tesco’s surplus bread is reduced in price while still on sale, and some is sent to food distribution charities on the evening of its production. The remainder is then offered free in Tesco’s staff shop, after which it is sent for use in animal feed.“This initiative from Tesco is an excellent example of a simple solution to a common problem,” said David Moon, the head of business collaboration at Wrap. “Using surpluses in store to make a delicious new product saves good food from spoiling and reduces the cost of waste to the business.”Elsewhere in the supply chain, leftover bread was increasingly being used to make beer: breweries including social enterprise Toast Ale and Adnams used Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s leftover factory sandwich bread crusts, while the Gail’s Bakery chain made a fresh sourdough loaf from its own unsold loaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb911d7b66897ef199971e71134874b1f7e776b/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc4d695f6dbb0a06ddbbfc85434bb59c","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"This week: a seal is released back into the wild and sparrows enjoy tarte flambée leftovers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76dd991cec3ddc4cf5c612ecf4e339dcf6043e93/0_0_2998_4497/master/2998.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=518de49833bcbaef55d998c096a0c217 1400w","title":"yotam ottolenghi summer al fresco feast recipes pork vindaloo slaw mango ice cream","story":"Recipes for a pulled pork curry, a zingy slaw and a mango ice-cream you can make ahead for an barbecue or summer partyNow’s the time when we all head outdoors to soak up every last bit of rare sunshine, like a bunch of cold-blooded reptiles. It’s only natural, then, to take food outside with us. Any outdoor meal for a crowd is no easy feat, however, so those you can plan and prepare ahead of time are lifesavers. For my alfresco spread today, the pork can be left pretty much to its own devices, the slaw can be set aside for a good few hours (add the herbs and garnishes at the last minute) and the pudding can be tucked in the freezer the night before. All at the ready for a jolly summer feast.The zingy dressing makes this a great side for the spicy vindaloo, but it’s also a wonderful standalone dish. If you’re short on time, use regular salted cashews or peanuts instead of the turmeric cashews. They are pretty special, though, so it won’t hurt to double the amounts here – they keep in a sealed container for up to a week.1 white cabbage (850g), finely shredded1-2 carrots (180g), peeled, cut in half widthways, then thinly sliced and julienned1 red onion (120g), peeled, halved and very thinly sliced15g coriander leaves, with some stalks attached5g mint leaves, pickedFor the turmeric cashews2 tbsp light soft brown sugar2½ tsp olive oil¾ tsp turmeric200g roasted and salted cashews2 tsp cumin seedsFor the curry leaf oil1 red chilli, thinly sliced seeds and all3 tbsp olive oil2 stems fresh curry leaves (ie, about 20 leaves)For the lime dressing70ml lime juice (ie, from about 4 limes)2 tsp dijon mustard2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tbsp poppy seedsSalt and black pepper75ml olive oilHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. First make the cashews. Put the sugar, oil, turmeric and two tablespoons of water in a small saucepan, bring to a boil on a medium heat, stirring often, then add the cashews and cumin. Cook for three to four minutes more, stirring constantly, until the seeds and nuts are coated in a sticky glaze, then transfer to an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and spread the nuts out over it. Bake for 14 minutes, stirring once halfway, until golden, then remove and leave to cool completely.Meanwhile, make the curry leaf oil. Put the chilli and oil in a small frying pan on a medium heat, and cook for seven minutes, or until the chilli starts to develop a shine. Add the curry leaves, cook for two to three minutes more, stirring often, until they turn translucent, then tip into a bowl.For the dressing, whisk the lime juice, mustard, garlic, poppy seeds and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a small bowl, then whisk in the oil in a steady drizzle, until incorporated.In a large bowl, mix the cabbage, carrots, onion, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Pour over the dressing, mix well to combine, then leave to soften for about 15 minutes. Fold in the herbs, then transfer to a platter. Drizzle the curry leaf oil all over and sprinkle on a third of the turmeric cashews, serving the rest in a bowl alongside.Whenever I’m feeding a crowd, I am a huge fan of large cuts of meat or large whole vegetables, slow-cooked with minimal work and maximum flavour.

Pat dry the pork, then sprinkle a teaspoon of salt all over it. Put two tablespoons of oil in a large, heavy-based, cast-iron saucepan for which you have a lid. Turn on the heat to medium-high, sear the pork, turning occasionally, until lightly browned all over – about eight minutes in all – then transfer the meat to a plate or board.Add the final tablespoon of oil to the pot, then fry the onions, stirring, until lightly coloured – about three minutes. Add the blitzed spice mixture, 400ml water and a teaspoon of salt, return the pork to the pan and bring to a boil. Cover the pan, transfer to the oven and slow-roast for four hours, basting every hour or so, until quite tender. Remove the lid, roast uncovered for 80 minutes more, basting once or twice, until the meat is well browned and the sauce thick and rich.Use two forks to shred the pork into the pan juices (do the same with the skin, too, if you want, or just discard it), then stir in the coriander and lime juice.Put the yoghurt in a small bowl and swirl through the mango chutney, so it’s rippled. Serve the pork with the yoghurt, bread rolls and slaw (see next recipe), leaving your guests to build their own plate or sandwich as they please.This couldn’t be easier to whip up for a crowd and, after the spiced richness of the vindaloo, provides welcome refreshment, too. It’s not totally smooth, but rather a delicious mix of flaky, icy and creamy.

It has also changed how people see the sportIt’s changed my (male) partner’s view of women’s football. He didn’t know much about it before and assumed the women’s game must be somehow “less exciting” because it’s not as popular, but he’s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me – even if I get a bit vocal sometimes!He’s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women’s football should be put on level standing with the men’s game. He’s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women’s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I’m so proud of him! I’m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn’t play football because it was a ‘boys sport’. Jen, South YorkshireWe usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men’s team, but this is the first time we’ve watched a women’s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I’ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I’ll be supporting USA. Andy Bartlett, LondonThe tournament has changed my perception of the women’s game completely. Prior to the tournament I’d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes.We travelled to Nice to watch England’s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer’s World Cup. I’m already making plans to attend some Women’s Super League games next season – something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women’s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I’m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. Grant, 29, LondonThe tournament hasn’t been a massive change for me. I’ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I’ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They’ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men’s game). I’m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! Julie B, MinneapolisWatching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women’s football. The game is better than the men’s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I’ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women’s games. They’ve only had one season and have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City, so it’ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I’m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. Harry Bloom, GlossopThis World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women’s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women’s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I’m hooked.It’s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do – it’s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they’re all so engaging?For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is – the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-BowlandI’ve always loved the Women’s World Cup. This year, however, there’s something more in it for me as it feels like the most erse tournament I’ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn’t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered “soccer” – thanks largely to the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s – I was in love and convinced I’d found my sport.But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment. I never returned to the game and it’s something I’ll regret for the rest of my life.I am thrilled at how many black women and women of colour are at this World Cup. From the powerful story of the Reggae Girlz, to Wendie Renard and, of course, Crystal Dunn. The feeling of joy I get seeing this representation is indescribable.There are very few occasions when women are celebrated at an equal or comparable level as men. As a 29-year-old from US, I’ve seen women fight to be taken as seriously as men in music, business, the culinary field, writing, film and, of course, sports for nearly 30 years. But in that time I’ve also witnessed my country celebrate our women’s national team with genuine fervour and respect.This tournament has given us the chance to see women become national heroes and to be taken seriously not for their appearance, but for their grit and talent. Regardless of who wins, I think it’s been a tremendous success for the women’s game and a great moment in the march towards gender parity.

So here we are, with the Women’s World Cup final about to be beamed into television sets across the planet, as names such as Megan Rapinoe, Vivianne Miedema, Wendie Renard and Lucy Bronze become more famous by the day, and hundreds of journalists have descended on Lyon to fill the back pages of the national newspapers with buildup and analysis.It all feels an extraordinarily distant cry from my first encounter with the Women’s World Cup final, which for reasons never quite fathomed led to me watching a feed via a miniscule monitor in what felt like a suffocatingly dark cupboard in Paris as co-commentator for the whole of Europe. If this episode of moonlighting is a little known fact, that’s because the only way to cope with this insane situation was the safe knowledge that virtually nobody out there, anywhere, would be watching.The scene was the 1995 Women’s World Cup. This was only the second ever official edition of this tournament since Fifa gave the idea its blessing. The event was supposed to take place in Bulgaria but when that prospect was abandoned Sweden stepped in as host. Just for a bit of perspective consider that 2,286 showed up for Brazil’s first match, which dwarfs the 655 in the audience for England’s opener, which puts the 250 in attendance for Nigeria’s introductory appearance into the shade. Twelve teams participated in all.Did I know any of this at the time? Not at all, I’m afraid. It was my rookie year as a football writer. Somewhere along the way I had met the benevolent people running Eurosport, who were evidently way ahead of their time when they came up with the radical idea that it might be worth trying to include a female voice on the subject of football.After a couple of tries reading out scripts to accompany highlights for their European roundup show, it was suggested I could be the colour commentator for the final. When I made it clear I really was no expert on the women’s game and had never commentated, it somehow wasn’t considered to be a major setback in terms of suitability. Deep end is something of an understatement.The good news was that nobody in the world knew more facts about football in any shape or form than the main commentator. His name was Angus Loughran, better known in the 90s as “Statto”, the character in the show Fantasy Football League, hosted by David Baddiel and Frank Skinner to cherish the best of football and humour in one hugely successful cult programme. Statto always wore pyjamas and a dressing gown and dispensed an encyclopaedic range of nerdish facts on demand.Fortunately Angus was not wearing pyjamas on the night of the Women’s World Cup final but it was still a challenge for us to survive the broadcast. The cupboard-cum-studio was titchy and boiling. The monitor delivering the live feed was diddy. Best of the lot, we didn’t have a pre-match team sheet, so come kick-off did not even have a list of the names and numbers of the players we were not particularly familiar with. And that was the only channel broadcasting the final to any interested viewers covering an entire continent. Anyway, Norway beat Germany 2-0, in case you were wondering.“There may soon be a female version of John Motson and Brian Moore on our television screens,” noted the Daily  around this landmark moment of a female voice commenting on football in 1995. While I happily retreated from the microphone to the safety of a laptop, since then plenty of others have normalised the sight and sound of women covering football.It is part of the broader picture that sees more girls and women playing the game, coaching, officiating, working in clubs and federations. France may not have made the final but they are world leaders in terms of equality at the French Football Federation, with women holding a range of senior roles just because the president, Noël Le Graët, recognises that the best people for the job are the best people for the job full stop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62beaf9c1a5fd8c256ddb59246b9dda8f839f83b/0_297_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e227d7c5a22d04b73ad854ad3aea73","title":"were you and your partner married by a loved one in an unofficial ceremony","story":"Who did you choose to conduct your ceremony and why?

I am also disappointed I didn’t learn Spanish when I lived there.When did you last cry, and why? Driving home on my own, thinking about the last 18 months, which have been really difficult, and getting back to playing tennis again without any pain in my hip.

Make of that what you will.And… did you kiss?Nope.If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Him taking a bit of interest in what I had to say.Marks out of 10?Four for effort.Would you meet again?I don’t think so – although it turns out we roam similar parts of London, so it may be more of an awkward run-in than anything else.What were you hoping for?A manic pixie dream girl or free hummus.First impressions?She was cool and comfortable with my lateness.What did you talk about?Books I hate, stuff my friends told me to say on the date, philosophy, this other date I’d been on, this other date Rachel had been on.Good table manners?Her ability to manipulate food with a knife and fork was good.Best thing about Rachel?When we ided the leftovers, she let me have first pick – I’m sure the homeless guy I gave all my food to appreciated that.Would you introduce her to your friends?They wanted to FaceTime me and say hi, but I was being sensible.Describe Rachel in three wordsActually quite safe.What do you think she made of you?Probably that I’m a bit of an idiot.Did you go on somewhere?Rachel got the tube home and then I went and hung out with my fake cousin and a girl we met who was on a stopover in London.And... did you kiss?Nope.If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I’d do it the same, but in Greece.Marks out of 10?I’d give Rachel a four, not because the date wasn’t good but because I wanted to make a Mean Girls reference (Four for you Glen Coco, you go Glen Coco!).Would you meet again?As friends, for sure.• Rachel and Ty ate at the Real Greek, London W1.

Hungover? Anxious? Don’t reach for the tablets you could find the cure in your own garden or local parkI recently walked into a tree. I didn’t mean to, but I was, as usual, looking at what was growing around my feet and not where I was going. The result was a messy scrape of torn skin, but nearby was also the solution: I plucked a few leaves of herb robert and a number of ribwort plantain leaves, mashed them between my fingers till their juices flowed, and pressed the mash into my cut. Within an hour it was knitting back together a week later you could barely tell it had happened.Both herb robert (Geranium robertianum) and ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata) are common wildflowers – many would call them weeds – with powerful healing properties. Herb robert is a styptic and excellent vulnerary herb, meaning it stems bleeding and heals wounds it is astringent, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory and has long been used for scrapes, insect bites and minor sores. Ribwort plantain has similar properties.No one is doubting the miracles that modern medicine has brought, but humans have always mashed leaves and chewed barks, by boiling roots and pressing seeds. When I pluck a leaf to help me out, I am reminded of all that came before me.Simple solutions to minor problems already grow in your garden as weeds or ornamental flowers. Understanding how plants can help us is not only rewarding, it means one less plastic plaster in the bin, one less unrecyclable teabag. It is also a powerful lesson in thrift and natural economy.Make a poultice by mashing leaves and sometimes roots from clean plant material until their juices flow, and applying this mash to the skin: both ribwort (P. lanceolata) and broadleaf plantain (P. major), can help heal minor wounds, draw out splinters, and are especially good for insect bites. Both grow on path edges, lawns and long grass. Herb robert smells musky when crushed, but the juice is a powerful styptic, stopping a cut or a thorn wound in seconds. Selfheal (Prunella vulgaris) is another fellow of wilder lawns that is amazing at helping wounds to heal. It’s a strong antimicrobial and will knit together difficult grazes. Chickweed (Stellaria media), another common weed of bare ground in the garden, turns into a soft, kind herb for the skin when mashed. It will soothe rashes and sores. All these herbs are safe for general use.Borage (Borago officinalis) and common comfrey leaves can both be mashed into a poultice and applied to strains, bruises and swellings. The amount of times I have pulled a muscle or dropped something on my foot while gardening, applied a poultice overnight (between sheets of kitchen paper and covered with clingfilm, to prevent staining sheetsclothes) and marvelled at the results the next day. Both can be turned into an oil or ointment for regular use. Comfrey and borage both have hairy stems that can irritate sensitive skin as a poultice, in which case an ointment is better. Both are safe for general use.Korean liquorice mint (Agastache rugosa) is not a common herb, but should be. An easy-going perennial with liquorice-tasting leaves and brilliant purple flowers, I swear it’s the best hangover tea. It will soothe your sore head and settle your stomach. If liquorice isn’t your thing, try lemon balm. As a tea it will calm nausea, aid digestion and is deeply relaxing. It is safe for general use, but shouldn’t be consumed regularly by anyone with a thyroid condition.The seeds of fennel, caraway and dill are carminatives and aid digestion, meaning they help with bloating, gas and indigestion. The nutty, sweet flavour of toasted fennel seeds is a delightful way to consume such a medicine, but all three can be made into a tea for after dinner, with a little honey added, if necessary. To get the most out of the seed, bash it a little first, then steep for 10-15 minutes. All the good properties in herbal teas are lost if it is not covered for 10 minutes if you don’t have a teapot, cover a mug with a saucer instead. You can also chew directly on the seeds.Rosemary, thyme and sage, together or separately, bruised and then steeped in hot water for at least 10 minutes will make a killer antimicrobial tea. Adding dried apple will make sage more palatable. Equally as good cooled and drunk as a flavoured water.Elderflower and elderberries have strong antiviral properties. Elderflower is lovely steeped in water for four or more hours, perhaps with a few slices of orange and lemon. Elderberries need to be brewed in a rolling boil with plenty of honey added. The leaves and stems of elder will give you an upset stomach, so remove flowers and berries with the back of a fork first.Nettles have good antihistamine properties, so are great for hayfever sufferers. Use either fresh or dried leaves to make an infusion. I prefer the taste of fresh nettles mix dried nettles with elderflower or lemon verbena to improve the flavour. The plant needs to be harvested before it flowers, for potency.Hyssop is a lovely old-fashioned herb that brings the bees to the garden. It has beautiful purple flowers that, once you’ve let the bees have their share, can be picked and steeped in honey for a soothing cough syrup. Or add to herb teas to help ward off colds.The bright, brilliant orange flowers, leaves and unopened seedpods of the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) make an excellent tea add honey and lime blossom, and perhaps a few lavender seed heads, for a pleasing bedtime drink.Lemon balm is good for an anxious brain that is whirring around too much. Drink the tea an hour or so before bed.Proust was a huge fan of linden, or lime blossom, tea. You may not have a lime tree in your garden, but I bet your local park does. Pick the flowering bracts when they are fully opened and bright yellow green in colour and dry on a warm windowsill. The tea is delicious and so soporific. It can be used by anyone. Equally as good is a lime blossom bath before bed.For those looking to learn more about herbs and their uses, the Herb Society is a wonderful resource• A Modern Herbal by Alys Fowler is published by Penguin on 11 July, priced £20.

A city that is unfortunately so near to Birmingham that it is often forgotten about, but also fortunately just far enough away that we don’t speak with that accent. In fact, “we speak with an accent that’s exceedingly rare!” At least that’s what the Coventry City fans sing every week, whether it’s at the Ricoh Arena or at away games up and down the country – or that season we played our home games in Northampton, but we don’t talk about that.Luckily, due to our location on one of the country’s most central rail lines, it’s incredibly easy for us to get to just about anywhere in the UK, whether it be for football, shopping, boozing, sightseeing, or … what else is there?And if you’re coming to us by rail (TIP: London Northwestern Railway has FREE wifi in every carriage), there are some unspoken things you should know about us lot, located smack bang in the middle of England.No, Coventry is not basically BirminghamThis assertion is lazy geography. We are 20 miles away from Birmingham. Sunderland is barely 15 miles away from Newcastle upon Tyne but you wouldn’t say “Newcastle is basically in Sunderland”, unless you wanted to get banished from the north-east forever. Solihull is a town that is “basically” Birmingham. We are our own city, with enough cathedrals to spare (more on that in a minute).Coventry – and its spirit – is indestructibleDue to our extremely central location – Meriden, the traditional centre of England is just 8 miles away – we’ve often found ourselves in the middle of some heated situations. The most notable of which was the Coventry blitz, which took place on the night of the 14 November 1940. It was the single most concentrated attack on a British city during the second world war. It lasted for 11 hours as the Luftwaffe essentially attempted to knock Coventry off the map, being one of the UK’s major centres for war production. The old cathedral was mostly destroyed during that raid, but its remains now serve as a phenomenal event space.We also have a rich history of cathedralsWhile the old cathedral was destroyed, as mentioned, we had an old, old cathedral that Henry VIII ordered to be destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries in the early 16th century. What remains of it is still standing and open to the public in the Priory undercrofts, which was dug up by Tony Robinson for a Time Team special in 1999 on Channel 4. Side note: There is a Nando’s right next to the Priory gardens, so you can make a decent afternoon of history and chicken.Enjoy flying abroad? You have us to thank for thatIf we are honest, we aren’t the greatest at making a big deal about the things we’ve done in the past. For a city that was essentially the beating heart of the country’s motor industry, we should at least talk about it as much as Brummies like to talk about how they are the second city.But more impressive than that is Coventry’s very own Sir Frank Whittle. No, it’s not just the name of a school in Walsgrave – Sir Frank Whittle was the genius behind the modern jet engine, which effectively changed the world.When Sir Frank first brought forward his plans to the UK’s Air Ministry in 1929, his blueprints were called “impractical”. Just eight years later, in 1937, his Whittle Unit engine roared into life, and by 1941 jet-powered planes were heading to war. The rest, as they say, is history.If you call it the Phoenix or the Kasbah, we know you are a studentClubs change names, that’s true, but we never forget – or stop calling them by – their older names.That club on Primrose Hill Street in Hillfields is The Colly (or Colosseum for the more formal among you) not the Kasbah, despite what it says above the doors. Those who really know their history will recall a brief period in the early 90s when it was called the Tic Toc, and played host to Blur and Ocean Colour Scene amid Britpop fever. The Phoenix? That’s the Colin Campbell or the Campbell to those who grew up here. And the building with the domed roof opposite? Before it was a Cov Uni building it was an old Odeon theatre.We still really hate Aston VillaIt’s been nearly 20 years since both clubs were even in the same ision – the 200001 season of the Premier League – but we still despise the Birmingham club, with a passion. Attend any Coventry City game and you’ll hear the fans singing “S**t on the Villa”. It’s not clever, but it is funny. The reason why?

Over time this evolved into “process of baking” to “event of baking” to “the set of things baked” and eventually to a “set of things”, ie a batch. And these bread rolls would be baked in batches too.

I had a whole series of non jobs in my 20s and reached a point where I wondered how I could explain the gap in my CV, but I started freelancing. Around this time – 1990 – print journalism was expanding, there were lots of supplements being born, and therefore plenty of work for freelancers. I sent a piece in to the  on spec and it was used in the paper, and things took off from there. I was commissioned by the Independent on Sunday to write for their Education and Society supplement and gradually became a feature within their pages. Then the  gave me a freelance contract, which required me to submit a certain number of words per year, so I had some job security. I started writing for G2 and got to know other  editors, many of whom were kind enough to give me a chance at writing for them.Yes, and I vividly recall feeling at home right from the start. I loved the people, and it was a great opportunity to learn the really useful practice of writing to deadlines. In the old days, you would pitch an idea and then have a week or so to write it up, but in the new world we only had a day or two, and it was a really useful discipline to master, because the turnaround for copy has just become faster and faster. At the time that I started, I was also writing for the Evening Standard and I wrote several books in the following years – on football, parenting, politics. In 2000 we created the Digested Read, which I did for 19 years.It’s hard to say. Things move so fast. In February 2014 when I took over, there wasn’t a lot going on politically. We all knew the coalition was in trouble, but often proceedings in the house were spectacularly dull. But as journalists we have to be there for all weathers, and in my case, I quite enjoy creating comedy out of boredom. Some weeks it has felt as though I’m trying to create something almost out of nothing, and others it feels as though every day is a major political event. The sketches in a way write themselves, but in many ways the world itself feels quite comedic and satirical at the moment, so I have to up my game.I work very closely with the lobby team – they give me info and tidbits whenever they can. Andy Sparrow, who writes our politics live blog, is great at helping check back on some of the observations I’ve made that day. But I’m not there to report the facts – we have a very good lobby team to do that. My job is to draw out and portray the psychodrama, the subtext, the meta-politics. I try to work at a conscious level and a subsconscious level, and let events trickle down. It helps to really understand the machinations of Westminster, though – who likes who, who likes what, who are arch rivals … and try to create a dramatic subplot from that. In these “alternative fact” times, the sketch has become more and more a form of truth-telling.Readers have been overwhelmingly lovely. Initially, when I took over from Simon Hoggart, there was a suspicion of me, and scepticism I could live up to him – he was an institution who had been sketch writer for over 20 years. People have by and large now forgiven me for not being Simon Hoggart and realised I have a different style. Simon’s comedy was more observational, mine is more satire. I think these are times that require satire. On a dull day, it’s an entertaining ersion for readers, but the job of a sketch writer is also to be one of the ones who is holding power to account, and serving a moral purpose. A lot of people feel genuinely angry, misrepresented and disenfranchised right now.I think readers value the fact that the sketch is equal-opportunities. I focus on the government, but when Labour make arses of themselves, I don’t feel it’s my job to prop them up, spare them or toe the party line. It’s not political or class warfare. A lot of Tory MPs are privately appalled by what is happening.To be recognised and heard. Initially I was put on articles to fill space in the various sections. There was so much advertising that sometimes there were up to 13 or 14 pages of Education editorial. No one had done the Digested Read before – it was Felicity Lawrence’s idea. She had been editor of a section called Consumer, whose desk was next to mine, and she liked the way I wrote and thought I’d be a great fit. Originally it was just a book a week and a short precis. We had a lot of fun doing parodies of style and a retelling of the book, so that it combined critical review with entertainment and added to the experience of reading the original work itself.I moved to G2 in 2007 and started writing a parody of the week in Westminster, before taking over the sketch from Hoggart. It was absolutely terrifying taking over such a high profile gig. I was suddenly thrown out of the comfort of the office and sent to Westminster to work with a bunch of people I had only ever read in print – it was a steep and terrifying learning curve. 2015 was my first general election – I didn’t know where I was supposed to be, but fortunately my colleagues were hugely helpful. With the sketch, I’m writing for quite a sophisticated audience who know a lot about politics, especially now, when people have become so politicised, and I want to be able to add something to all that. There’s still a lot to learn. When people talk about the Westminster bubble, that’s absolutely spot on. A lot of the people I encounter are semi-detached from the rest of Britain, and even just from the rest of London.The big question is still Brexit. It has been so dominant in the political agenda, and it can be a struggle to write about the same topic for a long time and keep it interesting. Amid the repetition of the Brexit cycle, I started referring to May as “Maybot” – to describe her style of government and her character, and it was adopted into common parlance at other newspapers and TV channels. I’ve recently started referring to Boris Johnson as Mr Blobby because there’s something quite cartoonish and absurd about him. He is up in arms promising to “deliver Brexit” but there’s absolutely no detail there – we are completely in the dark about how he might do that, so I think we need to keep asking to what extent our politicians are being responsible for their actions. With so many big promises, it is guaranteed that at least one or two contingents of society are going to be sorely disappointed.We have a top, top team. We are one of the few papers which is genuinely independent, which means we are fair in both directions. And we have been proved right so many times. When May was touted as a strong woman who could deliver Brexit, the  said “hang on, she doesn’t have a plan!”. We have never been a cheerleader for one side or the other, which probably irritates some people on occasion, but we’re not there just to bash the Tories – and equally when I write something disobliging about Corbyn, I get stick for it. The point is we are responsible for holding these figures to account, no matter which side of the political spectrum they fall on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/552c5fcf186be7a30f474985a67f99f71c022609/0_130_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83d192e08d9a3455fe0b021fb1634a2f","title":"life goals how three women made their money work","story":" Sacrifice isn’t easy, whether it’s postponing a holiday or giving up takeaways. Putting that extra money into an ISA or an investment portfolio, however, could make a real differencePutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

The tax does not cover sugary milk-based drinks but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has suggested this could happen as a way of tackling childhood obesity.Johnson’s campaign is being directed by Mark Fullbrook, who co-runs the London company in Crosby’s empire, Crosby Textor Fullbrook Partners (CTFP).The company does not say which firms it represents in the UK.A register of lobbying interests in New South Wales shows the Australian part of Crosby’s business, Crosby Textor Research Strategies Results, acts for the dairy multinational Parmalat.The Italian-based company, owned by the French dairy group Lactalis, sells various brands of sugared milk-based drinks in Australia, some with higher sugar content than soft drinks such as Coca-Cola, which would subject them to an extended UK-style sugar tax.Fullbrook worked with Johnson on his successful 2012 campaign to win a second term as London mayor. He was also behind Zac Goldmith’s losing mayoral campaign four years later, which was condemned by critics as racist for focusing extensively on the Muslim background of the eventual winner, Labour’s Sadiq Khan.The Crosby Textor group said Fullbrook had taken holiday to work with Johnson, and had no contact with any of the company’s clients. But Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said he was concerned about the situation.“There is a clear responsibility on MPs to avoid actual or perceived conflicts of interest,” he said. “It appears Johnson has no regard for this principle and the ministerial code would be worthless were he the person responsible for enforcing it, as the prime minister is supposed to do.“Crosby must immediately register his firm with the lobbying register and provide a full list of the clients he represents. Johnson must also come clean as to what role Crosby had in formulating his sugar tax proposals. Both have serious questions to answer.”A spokesman for CT Group, the parent organisation that includes the British and Australian firms, said: “As has been reported extensively, Mark Fullbrook has taken holiday to volunteer for Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign and has no contact with any clients. To suggest or imply that CT Group has anything to do with the campaign’s policy announcements is completely and utterly wrong and deliberately misleading.”There was no comment from Johnson’s campaign team.In January it emerged that Johnson received £23,000 in loans and donations from CTF Partners to help pay for office and staffing costs.Crosby and his firms have been heavily involved in several Conservative election campaigns, a number of them successful.

I expect Conservative members to follow that,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.McLoughlin acknowledged the error has “got to be looked at”, but added: “It can’t be clearer, it’s right there on the ballot paper saying that you must only vote on one occasion and I expect people to do that.”Johnson is the favourite to win the vote, which closes on 22 July. The result will be revealed a day later.Iain Duncan Smith, the former party leader and chairman of Johnson’s campaign, said the chairman of the Conservative party had been asked to look into the problem of multiple ballot papers being given to members.“Obviously there is an issue here, I accept that,” Smith told the Today programme. “In all elections there are issues about this, where people are registered separately.”Smith echoed McLoughlin’s call for Tory members to not vote more than once. “It’s quite clear as Patrick McLoughlin said that you are not to vote more than once.“But it’s clear that the Conservative party needs to continue to do some work and look into how they can actually sift this properly so that they recognise who is who.”The Electoral Commission, which sets standards for how UK elections are run, has no role in the leadership contest.Theresa May will take her final session of prime minister’s questions on 24 July and hand over to the contest winner that afternoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd56842cb5f86a2bfb957e08aacee41e762780a/173_156_5582_3349/master/5582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06634d313d1946e21854006e14382d86","title":"he was covered in bruises the vulnerable children being harmed in special schools","story":"Beth and Peter Morrison were thrilled when their son got into a school that catered for his disabilities. Then they learned he was being restrained, bound and injuredBeth and Peter Morrison remember every detail about the day their son Calum returned, broken, from Kingspark school. It was Friday 24 September 2010. The school bus dropped him home at 3.25pm. His face was ashen, his lips blue. He was wearing different clothes from those he had left in that morning – a thin T-shirt, shorts and plimsolls, no underwear and no coat. His own clothes were soaked in urine and stuffed in a plastic bag. “I asked him what was wrong. He said: ‘I dizzy, Mummy, teacher hurt,’” Beth says. Although Calum was 11 at the time, he still spoke like a toddler.Beth called the school immediately to find out what had happened. Beth says she was kept holding for more than 15 minutes before being told staff were in a meeting. That evening, Calum was clingy and tearful. “As I was tucking him in for the night, he said: ‘No school, Mummy, school bad.’”The next morning, when Beth was taking off his pyjamas, she noticed the bruises on his upper arms. She asked Calum about them. “Teacher hurt arm. Wet on the floor,” he said. She looked in the home-school diary – a logbook used by the school and Calum’s parents to relay noteworthy incidents – for clues as to what had happened. Nothing was recorded.We are sitting in the kitchen of the Morrisons’ bungalow in a small coastal town near Dundee. Their home, which has been adapted to Calum’s needs, has a warm, welcoming feel. Calum, now 20, wanders in and out. He is lovable, chatty and childlike. His language still resembles that of a four-year-old.In Calum’s early years, his parents thought he was simply a gifted child. He taught himself to read at three and on his first day at primary school he wrote the word “conscientiousness” on the teacher’s desk. At seven, he had a reading age of 14. Yet he was still non-verbal. He was sent to a specialist, who diagnosed hyperlexia – a syndrome characterised by a child’s precocious ability to read, accompanied by profound difficulties in understanding and talking. He was also diagnosed with epilepsy, cerebral palsy and autism.It had all started so promisingly at Kingspark, a special educational needs school in Dundee. The school, which caters for children with complex medical problems and learning difficulties, had just opened. The facilities were impressive – two swimming pools, specially adapted bikes, a soft-play area, sensory rooms. Most importantly, it had a fully equipped medical centre on site. The medical team could reach anywhere in the building within a minute of a panic button being pressed. Beth and Peter were relieved. Their son would be happy here.And he was. For six weeks. Then they were told that Calum was being placed in the school’s enhanced support area (ESA). “I thought it was a promotion, and we were pleased Calum was doing so well,” says Beth. It was on his first day there that he returned home badly bruised. “He did have regular seizures, so we thought perhaps he had injured himself and staff had held his arms tightly to prevent further harm,” Peter says. Although Beth was not able to speak to a teacher when she called that afternoon, the Morrisons were convinced there must have been a simple explanation, so they sent Calum back to school the following Monday.From 9am, Beth phoned the school repeatedly to find out what had happened, but she says nobody would talk to her. In the afternoon, she says, a member of staff rang back. Beth asked if the bruises and urine-soaked clothes were the result of a seizure. She says she was told they were the result of Calum having had an outburst. “She said he had been restrained for ‘behaviour’ and then ‘urinated out of protest’. She said they had sat him in a chair with an egg timer in front of him, so he could see he was being punished. We later found out from staff statements that Calum had been strapped into a chair.”Nine years on, Calum’s parents are still shocked. “Urinating in protest?” Peter says. “Our son had not wet himself once since he was out of nappies. And he doesn’t have outbursts at home. Of course he gets upset sometimes, but we can always talk him round.” Not only had Calum never seen an egg timer, but he had no concept of time – and still has none today. Beth put all this to the school, and she says she can recite the reply verbatim: “Don’t worry, Mrs Morrison, we can handle this. It’s going to be hard, but we can manage this. Calum must learn to behave.”The Morrisons’ first thought was to take Calum out of Kingspark immediately. But they were told by the council that it was the only school equipped to deal with Calum’s needs and that a criminal prosecution against the parents could follow any refusal to school him. So they agreed to let him continue there while they sought advice.A day later, on Tuesday 28 September, Calum again returned from school distressed and wearing different clothes, his own soaked in urine and in a bag. He had a long abrasion down his spine and hundreds of tiny, red spots across his body. His parents feared it was meningitis and took him to the local doctors’ surgery. The GP suggested that Calum was suffering petechial haemorrhaging, most likely caused by extreme pressure on his chest while being restrained face down on the floor. She arranged for him to go to hospital for tests the next day, to rule out a blood-clotting problem. By Wednesday morning, all of Calum’s bruises were clearly visible – Beth counted 63 of them, including 16 on his upper right arm alone. His spine and throat were bruised and there were hand-print marks on his right shoulder and each of his ankles. The doctor who conducted the tests on Calum that day suggested the police should be informed about his injuries.Calum did not return to Kingspark that week. Beth asked what had happened on the Tuesday and says she was told that he had been restrained in the gym by four staff members, for “refusing to follow the same route as the other children” when riding a bike designed for children with disabilities. It later emerged from records of the incident that two members of staff were across his legs, one was over the top of his body while another held his chin off the floor. After being pinned down, he had wet himself. He was then stripped of his clothes and again put in the chair with the egg timer. Although Calum was 11, he weighed four stone (25kg) and was the size of an average seven-year-old.“If Calum’s injuries had occurred at home, our boy would have been removed from us,” Peter says. “But we were told that he had to return to the place that had hurt him. And we were repeatedly warned by Dundee council that it was a criminal offence to refuse to send him to school.”What is defined as “reasonable force” can be used in British schools to prevent a pupil from committing an offence, causing injury or damage or disrupting good order. Beth says that restraining children such as Calum for breaking rules is nonsense, because they have no concept of what the rules are. Then there is the slippery word “reasonable”. Beth believes the force used against Calum was anything but. The Morrisons said they would send him back to school only with a guarantee that he would not be restrained. Three weeks after his first restraint, Calum returned. There were no more bruises or soiled clothing, but he was terrified of the school. Eventually, it was agreed he would attend only for half days, which he did for the next two and a half years.Beth says the final straw came on Wednesday 15 May 2013. Calum was attending Kingspark only in the afternoons, driven there by Beth or Peter. That day, Beth and Calum arrived at 1.20pm. They waited in reception until a teacher arrived to take him. “I saw a small boy, about eight or nine years old, being led along a corridor, with two members of staff holding his upper arms tightly,” Beth says. “The boy started flapping his hands, like lots of autistic children do. He didn’t seem to be in danger of hurting himself or the others, but then staff appeared to slam his body into the wall and restrain him with a force that horrified me.”Beth reported what she had seen to the police, who investigated and brought no charges. Calum never returned to Kingspark. His parents sent him to Carnoustie high, a mainstream school, where he spent four happy years. “Peter and I watched proudly as he went to his senior school prom and had a fantastic time,” Beth says. “The staff loved him and he was very well cared for.”From the day Calum left Kingspark, Beth swore she would campaign to abolish the use of restraint for disciplinary purposes against special-needs children, and to ensure it is used as a last resort only to prevent harm to the child or others. She is also fighting to ensure that parents are informed when children are restrained. Six years on, she is still campaigning.Soon after Calum left, other parents got in touch to tell her their children’s stories. Peter says they hadn’t realised the practice was widespread, as there was no “school-gate culture” at Kingspark the children were picked up in the morning by a school bus and dropped at home in the afternoon. “This is how schools like Kingspark get away with it,” he says.In 2016, Beth won an award for outstanding achievement at the British Institute of Learning Disabilities. Last year, she was inducted on to the Saltire Society’s list of outstanding women of Scotland. But it is little consolation for the guilt she feels over her son’s experience, she says. “Calum tried desperately to communicate how distressed he was and I missed the signs. I will have to live with the fact for the rest of my life.”In 2015, Dr Brodie Paterson, a specialist in handling vulnerable people, published a report claiming that Calum’s injuries were “inconsistent” with the correct restraint techniques, and that he had “previously only come across such petechial haemorrhaging in fatalities associated with restraint application”. He claims that Calum was exposed to a potentially fatal level of risk that was “grossly disproportionate”. A police investigation concluded in March 2014 that there had been “no criminal intent” on the part of the staff who restrained Calum.Kingspark declined to comment on specific cases. A spokesperson for Dundee city council said: “The council has engaged with the Scottish children and young people’s commissioner’s investigation and subsequent report and has many of the recommendations in place. The most recent inspection of Kingspark school and local authority quality-assurance processes have found the school to provide a strong focus on ensuring the wellbeing of children and young people. These specific allegations were made nine years ago and it would not be appropriate to comment on inidual issues.”It was a fellow pupil who drew attention, in 2017, to the treatment of Michelle. The pupil – who, like Michelle, had special needs – scrawled a note that was passed on to Michelle’s parents. “Michelle has been locked in a room and has been banging on the door very loud all afternoon,” it said.Michelle’s parents, Jane and Andrew, knew she had behaviour issues, but they had no idea that their 15-year-old daughter was regularly locked in a tiny, bare room. (The school has since admitted doing so.) “We were disgusted when we found out – sick and angry and sad,” Jane says. Like Beth, she talks of an overwhelming sense of guilt.We meet Jane on a windy day at a hotel in Edinburgh, not far from where the family live in a small town in the Scottish Borders. Michelle cannot be here because she is in hospital having her seizure activity monitored. She has a rare, severe form of epilepsy.Jane had a traumatic pregnancy. When she was 24 weeks pregnant, her brother died suddenly. She later discovered that, in the same week, Michelle suffered a stroke in the womb. Michelle was partly paralysed down the right side of her body. She was later diagnosed with autism and has traits of pathological demand avoidance (PDA), meaning that she resists everyday demands and expectations because they cause her huge anxiety.Shortly before her fourth birthday, Michelle started at a local nursery, three mornings a week. When she was asked to do something she didn’t want to do, or couldn’t do, she would lie on the floor shouting. At the age of six, she started primary school and began to exhibit aggressive behaviour – swearing, spitting and lashing out at staff. She progressed to a mainstream secondary school, which had an annexe for children with special needs. Jane was told that occasionally Michelle would be given “time out” in a “blue space”, but it seemed nothing to worry about. If anything, it sounded rather idyllic.Then Jane discovered that the space was a small, locked room with bolts on the outside, and that Michelle would hammer on the door to be released. Her parents withdrew Michelle from the school and began to investigate her educational history through freedom of information (FoI) requests. The more they found out, the more horrified they became. Her parents had never been told that she had been restrained at primary school and barred from school trips. One of a series of documents obtained under FoI revealed that Michelle’s teaching assistant had previous been sacked from a care home for abusing residents.Jane discovered from the documents that, at secondary school, Michelle had been secluded on a daily basis as punishment for non-compliance. As Jane points out, Michelle doesn’t know how to comply. Perhaps most shockingly, Michelle’s behaviour support plan, which her parents had never been shown, stated that if members of staff were spat at by Michelle, they should “use a tissue to wipe the spit off yourself and gently wipe it back on to Michelle”. “The instruction was written by a teacher without talking to us or Michelle’s doctor or any of the experts,” Jane says. “The behaviour support plan was purely punitive. It was threatening all the way through, written without any understanding of Michelle’s inidual needs.”The school’s internal memo of the afternoon that triggered the alarm, which was obtained through a subject access request by Michelle’s parents, states that Michelle was “guided to the safe room following a small incident” and that she was “in crisis and kicking the door and screaming at staff”. The memo also states: “Staff clear this was not her asking to get out, but demonstrating physical aggression.” It further records: “As incident happened at end of day, diaries had already been written – email to parents about incident didn’t happen because it wasn’t a high-scale incident.”Jane says that Michelle’s experience at school left her a wreck. “She couldn’t do the simple things that she used to do, like go for a walk, because she was so anxious.” Michelle is now thriving at the complexadditional needs unit in her new, mainstream school and her parents feel they have their daughter back. It is more than 20 miles each way, but Jane says it is worth it. Michelle has not been restrained or secluded once.More than once, Jane says that maybe she and Andrew were “thick” not to have realised what was going on but they had assumed that Michelle would be treated at school with the same respect as their other child, who does not have special needs. “Children with special needs were not treated as equals in this school,” she says. “They were dehumanised.”Jane says all her complaints to the council about the school have been upheld, except for one. Her voice rises with disbelief. “They said seclusion was good practice for Michelle, but we know just how traumatised she was by it.” A spokesperson for Scottish Borders council says: “To ensure our practice remains in line with national guidance, we have been working to develop a new inclusion policy. This includes clear guidance on seclusion and restraint.”Last December, the Scottish children’s commissioner, Bruce Adamson, published No Safe Place: Restraint And Seclusion In Scotland’s Schools. His investigation concluded that all such incidents should be recorded and that parents or carers should be told “as soon as reasonably practicable”. It also recommended that the Scottish government should publish a “rights-based national policy and guidance” on restraint and seclusion in schools. The Scottish government is still considering its full response.Meanwhile, in England and Wales, a review commissioned in 2011 by Michael Gove, then the education secretary, reached a very different conclusion. Gove asked Charlie Taylor, then the government’s adviser on behaviour in schools, to review the recording and reporting of the use of force in schools. Taylor’s report distinguished between mainstream schools, where the use of significant force is “extremely rare”, and special schools, where “some pupils, either due to a special need or because they have severe behaviour difficulties, can require more regular physical intervention”. He also stated that “special schools may have a different threshold for what is ‘significant’ force and they use their judgment to decide which incidents should be reported to parents”.Taylor reported that obliging schools to record significant incidents of force could have a “negative effect” on the relationship between staff in special schools and parents. He said it would “add to the bureaucratic burden for some, but not all, schools”.Taylor’s review did not cause an outcry at the time – perhaps because so few people knew about it. But campaigners today are appalled by its tone and its findings. They point out that it is impossible to know how widespread the restraint and seclusion of children is in schools, precisely because it has never been obligatory for schools to record and report it.The Challenging Behaviour Foundation stresses that the inappropriate use of restraint is not an issue in all special schools. “We have examples of children who have moved from one special school, where staff said it was impossible to support their child without the use of restrictive interventions, to another where they are never used,” says Vivien Cooper, the charity’s chief executive. “So this is about leadership, school practice, staff skills and training, not the type of school.” There are alternatives to restraint. For example, Cooper says, if a child suffers from sensory overload, a teacher can move them to a less noisy or brightly lit area non-verbal children can be taught signs or symbols to indicate that they need a break. “Schools using positive behaviour support report huge reductions in the use of restrictive interventions.”The government finished consulting on draft guidelines to reduce the need for restraint for young people with special education needs and disabilities in January 2018. Last week, it finally published that report. It recommended that policies should be in place “for promoting positive relationships and behaviours and eliminating unnecessary and inappropriate use of restraint”, and that a system should be in place for the recording and reporting of incidents “where required”.Campaigners are not impressed. “The guidance is non-statutory, does not cover mainstream schools – where we know much restraint and seclusion takes place – and does not require schools to inform parents if a restrictive intervention has taken place,” says Cooper. “It defends the use of restrictive practices such as seclusion rooms ‘as a disciplinary penalty’ and, unlike the equivalent adult guidance, fails to prohibit the use of prone restraint, which is known to pose significant risks. It is hard to square this with a stated commitment to children’s rights.”Make no mistake, Karen says: her son Adam is hard work. Adam is 14 and has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. He is potty-mouthed and has meltdowns galore, but she has never felt threatened by him. “He’ll hurl abuse at you or throw something, but he’d never actually attack anybody.” This made it all the more shocking when she discovered how many times Adam had been restrained soon after starting secondary school.Like Michelle, Adam also has traits of PDA, as well as a sensory processing disorder that means he can’t stand being touched. It is five years since Karen gave him a proper hug. But, she says, that is just the way things are with Adam the family has adapted. “Sometimes I ask him for a cuddle and he tells me to fuck off. The thing about Adam is that he says all the things we’d like to say but don’t. He’s got a brilliant sense of humour.”Karen and her husband John live in a well-to-do part of Essex. Their home is large, comfortable and messy – as you might expect of a family with four young boys. The back garden is crammed with rabbit hutches, footballs and bikes. On the wall by the front door is a framed quote – the family maxim: “In this house, we do ADHD, we do meltdowns, we do tears and frustration, we worry and we stress, but we also hope for a better day and we persevere and we smile because in this house we don’t go down without a fight.”Adam went to a mainstream primary school where he did OK. But after eight unhappy months at secondary school, Karen home-schooled him for a short period while a special school was found. He was eventually placed at a school in the county for children with social, emotional or mental health problems. Eighteen months on, he is still struggling after his brief experience there.By the time he left, he had been excluded 14 times and restrained on 30 separate occasions, in the space of 12 weeks. Often he had been restrained several times in one incident. “It all looked really good at the start, but I wouldn’t put my dog in that school,” Karen says. “One day, Adam came home and hid in the garage. He looked like he’d gone 10 rounds in a boxing ring. He was covered in bruises and was completely traumatised. The longer this went on, the more restraints were being used. They told us about things he’d done and I was thinking: ‘Is it actually my child doing this?’ Because we’d never heard of such behaviours.”Did she know about the restraint system before Adam started there? “I was asked to sign a form allowing them to restrain him. I refused, but they said he would be restrained anyway if necessary. But I never thought Adam would have to be. He used to go to army cadets, he played for a football team. We go to our caravan at the coast every weekend and he is never aggressive to any other children he’s got loads of friends down there.”Things came to a head in March 2018 when Karen received a call at 3.15pm telling her to go to school as there was a crisis. On her way there, she was passed by two police cars with their sirens blaring. After Adam had been restrained nine times that day, he had spat, kicked and thrown gravel at staff. The school called the police. When Karen arrived, Adam was standing on the playing field, hyperventilating and screaming. She tried to calm him down, but was told by police that she would be charged with obstruction if she didn’t get out of the way. Adam was then pinned down, handcuffed and put in a spit hood. “They took him to the station and me and my mum had to go and sit in custody with him till 1am,” says Karen. At the age of 12, Adam was convicted of criminal damage and six counts of actual bodily harm on staff, and given a reparation order – a non-custodial sentence supervised by a youth offending team.He never went back to the school and has struggled since. He was recently excluded from another special school after being restrained. Karen fears that the 2018 incident has damaged Adam irreparably, as well as the family. “I trusted those people to look after my child and look what happened. I will always feel guilty for that.”She sifts through the incident reports she obtained after making an FoI request, reading bits aloud. (Until today, her father had kept them because she could not face reading them.) Initially, her voice is calm and confident, but it soon begins to quiver. The details are shocking. In one incident, Adam was restrained for refusing to leave the school hall. “They are only supposed to restrain as a last resort. How can they say this is the last resort?” Karen says. Another report states that Adam said he could not breathe while being restrained. Karen is convinced that some of the staff simply didn’t know what they were doing. “They’ve done a short course on restraint and think they know it all. And they’re just damaging children.”The incident that resulted in Adam being charged lasted five hours and involved multiple restraints. Karen can barely believe what she is reading. “Three hundred minutes! All day that’s going on and then my son got arrested and charged at 12 years old.” She reads on: “‘Adam becomes increasingly aggressive when a hold is implemented.’ Of course he does. He’s got a sensory processing disorder and touch is his main trigger. I don’t have to touch Adam, so why do they?”Karen throws down the document. “What is happening to a 12-year-old child that he is in a tree with a rope around his neck? This is pretty bad, isn’t it?” She exhales deeply, trying to catch her breath. “If we behaved like this to our kids, we wouldn’t have custody of them.”A spokesperson for Essex county council said of the school: “Our last visit was in October 2018, and at that time all staff training was viewed to be up to date and in line with the behaviour policy. However, the safety and wellbeing of pupils in all Essex schools is paramount and when concerns are raised we will of course investigate when necessary.” The latest Ofsted report on the school, in January 2019, rated it as “good” and stated that procedures for the use of restraint were followed appropriately. The school added: “Parentscarers are informed every single time a child is restrained. Restrictive physical interventions are only used as a last resort, in order to keep the child and the people around them safe. All staff are fully trained in the use of management of actual or potential aggression techniques.”Karen says the experience has taken a toll. “It’s smashed our marriage. This situation has been so fraught that I’m always on edge.”When Adam started at the special school, he was meeting his academic targets and had not been in trouble with the police. Now, aged 14, he regularly goes missing, has a criminal record and still has the academic age of an 11-year-old. But Karen knows that, compared with some, he is lucky. “I’m a mum who’s quite intelligent and can say: ‘I’m not putting up with this’, but some parents have their own issues they haven’t got the ability to stand up to these people. Who’s going to fight for those children?”Back on the Dundee coast, Beth Morrison is preparing for the next stage of her battle. She has helped raised the funds to judicially review the secretary of state for education “in relation to the absence of a lawful statutory framework regulating the use of restraint of children” in Welsh and English schools. (She decided not to judicially review Scotland because she is confident it is on the brink of change.) All three claimants are children with disabilities who have experienced significant use of restraint at special schools in Wales, North Yorkshire and Essex. Beth argues that the current legislation discriminates against children with disabilities and is in contravention of the European convention on human rights.It is nine years since her son returned from school traumatised, but she will not stop until she has got justice for him and other children like him. “Calum is no longer in education, but I will not walk away. I cannot sit here knowing that these cruel things are happening to our most vulnerable children, in the very place they should be kept safe.”Some names have been changed.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

His radar is immaculate, as ever, and by the end of the over he’s almost enticing Mathews into giving Dhoni yet another catch.27th over: Sri Lanka 116-4 (Mathews 35, Thirimanne 26) Kohli decides he wants to hear some chin music, so Jadeja gets a breather (8-0-21-1) and Pandya comes back, bearing bouncers, both fast and slow. This time the batsmen can cope.“As we get down to the business end of the World Cup,” says Pratik Dubey, “I wonder what will be the injury of the tournament.” Good question. “For me personally I think Dhawan’s injury will prove to be decisive, as it has thrown off the balance of the Indian team and has upset their rhythm.” Yes, a serious blow. But it has only cost them a maximum of one match, hasn’t it?26th over: Sri Lanka 109-4 (Mathews 31, Thirimanne 24) A few singles off Kuldeep bring up the fifty partnership, off 14 overs, and then Mathews plays another of his cuts for four. The ship has been steadied, just about.25th over: Sri Lanka 102-4 (Mathews 26, Thirimanne 22) Two singles off Jadeja, who may well bowl his ten overs off the reel. This, Nasser Hussain notes, is Sri Lanka’s lowest total at the half-way mark in the 2019 World Cup.24th over: Sri Lanka 100-4 (Mathews 25, Thirimanne 21) Thirimanne chops Kuldeep for two to bring up the hundred. If there are any Sri Lankan supporters in the ground, they’re too deflated to make much noise.Something to read in case you’re less than riveted by this match: Vic Marks on the question of whether the final should be on free-to-air telly.23rd over: Sri Lanka 96-4 (Mathews 24, Thirimanne 18) Three singles off Jadeja, who can now expect not just to play against England, but to open the bowling and spook the hell out of Jason Roy. 22nd over: Sri Lanka 93-4 (Mathews 23, Thirimanne 16) Thirimanne gets a slog in, swinging Kuldeep for four to midwicket. This partnership is beginning to look as if might be OK after all.21st over: Sri Lanka 87-4 (Mathews 22, Thirimanne 11) If this is an audition for the semi-final, Jadeja has already aced it. He has the exemplary figures of 6-0-16-1, and England, if it is they, would surely rather face Kuldeep and Chahal, after bullying both the other day, than Jadeja plus one of those two.20th over: Sri Lanka 83-4 (Mathews 19, Thirimanne 10) This is more like it from Mathews, who seizes on a slightly short one from Kuldeep and cuts for four. “Morning @TimdeLisle,” says Guy Hornsby, “on what may yet be an interesting day before the semis. Really glad that Sri Lanka won the toss because this is their chance to put India under pressure.” It was, Guy, it was, and it may yet be again. These two just need to add another 130.19th over: Sri Lanka 77-4 (Mathews 14, Thirimanne 9) If Sri Lanka are going to get 240, Angelo Mathews will probably have to get 80. He’s in better form than he was, but that’s not saying much. He edges Jadeja for three to move to a less than authoritative 14 off 28.18th over: Sri Lanka 74-4 (Mathews 11, Thirimanne 9) Another run-out chance, fluffed by Pant, and it seems to knock some sense into the batsmen, who start milking Kuldeep.17th over: Sri Lanka 68-4 (Mathews 9, Thirimanne 4) Jadeja races through another over – it’s almost as if he’s not thinking of the people trying to write an OBO here. He has Thirimanne groping and missing, so SL remain on the ropes. 16th over: Sri Lanka 65-4 (Mathews 8, Thirimanne 3) Pandya takes a breather to congratulate himself on figures of 3-0-6-1, and Kohli opts for spin at both ends. Kuldeep Yadav finds some turn too, on a used surface, which perhaps gives Sri Lanka a glimmer of hope for later.15th over: Sri Lanka 62-4 (Mathews 7, Thirimanne 2) Jadeja keeps it tighter still, even with a slip and a short leg. And that’s drinks, with Sri Lanka falling apart and India, yet again, well on top without having to get everything right. This is one game that seems unlikely to finish in a win for the side batting first.14th over: Sri Lanka 61-4 (Mathews 6, Thirimanne 2) Pandya keeps it tight. The score predictor is saying 243, which the Sri Lankans would surely take, depending on the timing of their flight.13th over: Sri Lanka 58-4 (Mathews 4, Thirimanne 1) I’ve worked it out: the Sri Lankans have a flight home booked for about 5pm. Their next ploy is to try and contrive a run-out, but the fielding isn’t quite sharp enough to make it happen.Here’s Uma Venkatraman, pondering the semis. “If India win today and Australia lose, India get to play New Zealand in the semis. India might prefer to play the Kiwis rather than England, and the Kiwis would be happy to avoid Australia. As a bonus, we would get to watch India and New Zealand play after the earlier washout.” Good point. “That would leave England the task of denying the Aussies another final appearance and they would earn the gratitude of the cricketing world - well, at least mine. I would even root for England over IndiaNZ in the final.” It’s a deal.12th over: Sri Lanka 55-4 (Mathews 2, Thirimanne 0) How did this happen? The Sri Lankans have turned a breezy start into a crisis.Nooooo! Pandya tries a slower-ball bouncer and Fernando can only wave at it and get a top edge. That’s a smart move by Pandya, a hammer blow for Sri Lanka, and a fourth dismissal this morning for old man Dhoni. 11th over: Sri Lanka 54-3 (Fernando 20, Mathews 1) Five minutes ago Jadeja looked like being a curiosity in this World Cup, the sub fielder who was hardly ever off the field. But now he’s back as a bowler and doing the business – he saw Mendis coming and fired the ball in, but not so quick as to lose his natural turn away from the right-hander. Kumar Sangakkara reckons he will be ‘a force’ if, as you’d expect, India play England at Edgbaston.Kohli turns to spin, Jadeja finds some turn, and Mendis’s turn is all over as he charges down the track and misses. That was a strange decision, a desperate measure at a less than desperate time.10th over: Sri Lanka 52-2 (Fernando 19, Mendis 3) The bowling change does come, but it’s Bumrah who is taken off. Hardik Pandya replaces him, goes back-of-a-length as usual, and concedes only a couple of singles. So the powerplay ends with honours about even, given that the Sri Lankans have had to cope with the genius of Bumrah.“If England do play India again,” says Niall Mullen, “I wonder if Bumrah could tread on a ball while playing rugby.”9th over: Sri Lanka 50-2 (Fernando 18, Mendis 2) Kohli shows some faith in Kumar, not with his fields, which continue to change about three times an over, but by keeping him on. And it’s repaid as Kumar finds a tight line to tie Mendis down. The only run in the over comes from a misfield.8th over: Sri Lanka 49-2 (Fernando 18, Mendis 1) So Fernando is joined by Mendis. I have seen the future of Sri Lankan cricket and it is working already – Mendis takes a brisk single to get off the mark, and Fernando stands tall again and eases a square drive away for four, before pulling for four more. So Bumrah, after conceding only five off 19 balls, goes for nine off the next five. Keep him on, Virat – this is a proper contest.The masterclass continues. Perera, trying to find a way to score his first run off Bumrah, hangs a crooked bat out at a quick one outside off, which straightens to take the edge and give Dhoni another simple catch. And Bumrah has 2-5.7th over: Sri Lanka 40-1 (Perera 18, Fernando 10) Kohli persists with Kumar and perhaps regrets it as Fernando plucks another stroke from an old textbook, an upright push through the covers that’s so well timed that it goes for four. Then, as if suddenly alarmed at being labelled a classicist, Fernando chips high over mid-on for two. Kumar has 4-0-35-0. Even the captain of Ilford 2nds might take him off now.6th over: Sri Lanka 33-1 (Perera 17, Fernando 4) If that decision had stood, Bumrah would have had 2-0 off 16 balls. Instead he has 1-5 off three overs, as Fernando cashes in with a straight push for four, showing him the maker’s name. That’s class. It was too high, just going over the leg bail. Good news for Sri Lanka, and for the neutral.Bumrah, still immaculate, pins Fernando on the crease. Only the height can save him.5th over: Sri Lanka 28-1 (Perera 17, Fernando 0) Kumar finally gets it right and hurries Perera into a top-edged pull. It’s an easy catch for either mid-on or mid-off, but they both go for it and they collide. It’s Pandya and Kuldeep, a pair of schoolboys. Perera celebrates by smoking through the covers and tickling past Dhoni. Kohli has given up on slips altogether now, which is a bit feeble.4th over: Sri Lanka 17-1 (Perera 7, Fernando 0) So Bumrah follows a maiden with a wicket maiden. And so far this game is like what Graham Gooch famously said about facing New Zealand in 1990 – the World XI at one end and Ilford 2nds at the other. And here’s Peter Gluckstein. “As you quite rightly say, SL winning the toss should make for a more even contest. So, in future World Cups, why not award the toss in every game to the lower ranked team (going into the tournament)?? Might have completely screwed England in our last two games, mind you!”Boom boom Bumrah! After nine dots, even Karunaratne gets frustrated and has a waft outside off. A bottom edge and Dhoni barely has to move.3rd over: Sri Lanka 17-0 (Karunaratne 10, Perera 7) Kumar loses his length. Too short, so Perera shovels him to midwicket for three, even though it’s off the toe of the bat. Too short again, and even Karunaratne can slap that for four. Too full, and any opener in the world can clip that behind square for four more. Great over for Sri Lanka, and for the game. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Karunaratne 1, Perera 4) No need to score runs off Bumrah – just survive. Karunaratne manages it, but you do wonder, not for the first time, if he is cut out to be a one-day opener.1st over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Karunaratne 1, Perera 4) Bhuvi Kumar opens up – Sourav Ganguly reckons he’s been brought in to swing the ball away from the left-handers. He has two to bowl at here: Karunaratne, who is watchful as ever, and Kusal Perera, who drives his first ball, on the up, for a king four. Virat Kohli responds by taking second slip out, which seems a little hasty.In case you’re wondering how England can finally win the World Cup, Rob Smyth has a ten-point plan. India do rest a fast bowler, but it’s not Bumrah – it’s Shami, who is replaced by Jadeja, making for a shorter tail. Kuldeep comes in for Chahal as Kohli rotates his wrist spinners. Sri Lanka stiffen their seam attack, and their lower order, by bringing in Thisara Perera for Jeffrey Vandersay.Dimuth Karunaratne wins the toss and – like every captain now – chooses to bat first. Which should make for a more even contest.A few sub-plots. Sri Lanka, who will finish sixth whatever happens, pulled off an upset against England – can they do the same to India? They did it the last time these two sides met, also in England, in the 2017 Champions’ Trophy, which perhaps makes it less likely now, on the basis of lightning not striking twice in the same place. Can Avishka Fernando, who announced himself with a sumptuous hundred against the West Indies’ quicks on Monday, do something similar to Bumrah and Shami? Or will Bumrah be rested, now that India are being expected to play as often as everyone else? And if so, will Kohli be short of a cutting edge? Morning everyone and welcome to day 38 in the Big Brother house. By this evening, Phase One will finally be over. Only one question of any significance remains to be answered: who will finish top? It will be either Australia or India, both of whom play today. They’re through to the semi-finals already, but there’s a small prize still to be fought for: facing New Zealand, who are on the slide, rather than England, who are back to their best. Australia are ahead by a nose, also known as one point, so if they beat South Africa in the day-nighter at Old Trafford (from 1.30pm BST), the top spot is theirs. If they don’t, and India have seen off Sri Lanka in this game at Headingley (10.30am), it will be Virat Kohli who joins Kane Williamson for the toss on Tuesday. Somehow, this clunky format has managed to hold our interest to the end. As round robins go, it’s been even more long-winded than the Christmas sheet of A4 from a boastful friend. But a lot more entertaining."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa19a462a568ac5a61abf152a41a1b7c337f0d31/0_154_3978_2387/master/3978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0168d8171c44b9f2e1428d57c63c5a30","title":"tour de france 2019 stage one grand departlive","story":"145 km to go: The pavé on the Bosberg looks treacherous, and Meurisse pips Van Avermaet at the top. The two Belgians had dropped the other two members of that breakaway quartet but Van Avermaet has dropped back. Again, the peloton ease up the climb, and we have a long wait until the next climb, at Les Bons Villers. 150 km to go: Van Avermaet wins on the Mur!  Berhane goes off first, but is quickly reeled back in. Van Avermaet, hauls him back in, reels him back in. Berhane goes off the back and Mads Würz, and Xando Meurisse push Van Avermaet all the way but, and as expected, he takes the two points. That was short, but sharp. The gap, by the way, has already dropped to 2’ 25”, though the peloton is easing through Gramont. Now for the Bosberg. 152 km to go: The leading quartet are dropping into Gramont, which is teeming with fans as they begin the climb and hit the cobbles. Just under five kilometres until we get to the Mur, which is where the fun can begin. Bradley Wiggins can feel the earth begin to move, hear his needle hit the groove. Shaun Clapperton emails in: “Hi John, don’t kick yourself for not mentioning Roberto Uran as a contender for Le Tour. Kick yourself for not mentioning Rigoberto Uran.”I think I got all confused with Roberto Duran, hands of stone and all that. No mas. Now, what is the Anglicised version of RigobertoRigobert? William Fotheringham, in his stage-by-stage guide, suggests the Mur is going to be little more than garnish. The Tour starts with a loop southwards through Flanders into Wallonia and back, with two cobbled climbs celebrated as part of the Ronde van Vlaanderen, the Muur van Geraardsbergen and the Bosberg, and one stretch of pavé near Charleroi. These all come too early to have any serious impact so the peloton will be jostling for a bunch sprint as they tackle a finale that includes the towns of Waterloo – a gift for the headline writers – and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, childhood home of Eddy Merckx. Sprint favourites will include Caleb Ewan and André Greipel.170 km to go: We are 20 clicks or so from the Mur de Grammont, a steep, cobbled climb you may recognise from the Tour of Flanders. The gap is 3’ 15” or so to the peloton, probably not enough to stay away from the Classics specialists. In Flemish, since you’re asking, it’s called the Muur van Geraardsbergen.And here’s ‘The Cannibal’ on the 1969 Tour we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of, and the 17th stage: Luchon to Mourenx, where he seized control in the mountains. Let’s share some Eddy Merckx memories as we are celebrating the great man this weekend.180km to go: The breakaway group already have over three minutes on the main field. Gavin Laverty has an outside bet for you. “Just read the preamble. Speaking of coming forces that never quite came, what do you feel about Tejay van Garderen’s chances this year. He did have a half decent criterium but is 80-1 for Le tour!”It looks like he is in the role of super-domestique for187 km to go: There’s the rather unseemly sight of a horde of riders taking a comfort break by the side of the road they must have overdone the fluids in their preparations.Here comes three weeks of pain. There’s an attempted breakaway from the start from Team Katusha, with Greg Van Avermaet, Natnael Berhane, Mads Würtz Schmidt and Xando Meurisse. Two Belgians in there look like they fancy a go from Kilometre 0 in their home country. The other two are an Eritrean and an Austrian. The peloton sits up a bit and lets that group of four go away. It’s lively on the streets of Brussels, where the public will see the finish later this afternoon. Here’s the route for today while the riders are going through the ceremonials with a ride through a sunny Brussels, before the départ réel can begin in a kilometre or so. Bonjour. We go again, though there is many an absent friend not on this year’s Tour. No Tom Dumoulin. No Chris Froome. No Mark Cavendish. And the Sky Train will have to be renamed the rather unwieldy Ineos Train. Still, there’s always G, as in Geraint Thomas the defending champion. To call him a surprise winner last year is something of an understatement, and there is the possibility he will be on the end of a similar overturning of team orders as that which he performed last year with Froome. Egan Bernal hauled the dear, departed Sky Train over the mountains last season, burying himself in the process. With Froome having to become one of the oldest ever winners to make five Tours if he comes back next year - itself not guaranteed - and G 33 himself, the 22-year-old has time and talent on his side. Who are the other contenders? This is a highly open field, with former winner Vincenzo Nibali perhaps fancying a, er, nibble, then there’s Nairo Quintana, the coming force who never managed to get away far enough on the mountains. And Thibaut Pinot, who has a puncher’s chance of becoming the first French winner since Bernard Hinault in 1985. So, perhaps, has Romain Bardet. That is not an exhaustive list of the possibilities. This weekend, though, with its pootle through Belgium, is a tribute to Eddy Merckx, this being the 50th anniversary of his first win of five Tours. Merckx was “the cannibal” who ate his rivals for breakfast, probably the best rider of all during the spell from 1969 to 1974, before he suddenly pegged out in 1975. Today’s stage takes us through some Classic-style cobbles - pavé, if you will - and a couple of small but troublesome climbs - the Bosberg and ‘the Muur’ - and then back to Belgium’s capital for waffles, animal-strength beer and most likely a sprint. Elia Viviani, Dylan Groenewegen, Peter Sagan and Andre Griepel are the men expected to be dipping for the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a01f9dfd703e2db8f0248b35d7843462354d3a9f/0_1117_2917_1749/master/2917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5972012bc10bcc1aeb048b2d9548e53a","title":"how eye gaze technology brought creativity back into an artists life","story":"Sarah Ezekiel explains how accessible technology helped her paint and recover after a motor neurone disease diagnosis Sarah Ezekiel loves colour. Her living room is filled with bright and joyful prints created by herself and others. “I like so many artists and they have influenced my work. I particularly like Modigliani, Kandinsky and Picasso,” she says.Ezekiel lives with motor neurone disease (MND), and is unable to move from the neck down. Her own art – which can take months to make – is created using eye-gaze technology. An infrared bar picks up her eye movements, and this operates an on-screen mouse and keyboard. “Eye-gaze has allowed me to create again,” she says.She uses this technology not just to make her art, but in many parts of her life – from operating the TV controls to paging her carer, to using social media and writing emails. It has also enabled her to campaign on disability issues and volunteer for the MND Association, and Lifelites (which provides specialist technology for children in hospices), as well as other charities. She has won many awards, including Third Sector volunteer of the year 2016.Ezekiel’s feelings are mirrored by Microsoft, whose mission is to empower every person. This is achieved through integrating accessibility tech, such as the operating system to support eye-gaze technology, seamlessly alongside its Windows 10 and Office 365 suite.Ezekiel, who lives in Hendon, north-west London, was diagnosed with MND in 2000. At the time she was 34, and seven months pregnant with her second child. She was referred to a neurologist during an antenatal appointment the doctor immediately realised that her arm weakness and slurred speech were not due to pregnancy. Ezekiel was diagnosed with MND two months later and within a year was unable to use her hands. “I think I’ve become stronger since my diagnosis, because I’ve been through some very difficult times,” she explains.Although Ezekiel had always loved painting and drawing, and had been on a foundation course after she left school, earning a living had taken precedence over art. She worked as a personal assistant in publishing, with her ambition to become a fine artist overtaken by marriage and children then, later, by MND.In 2010, she began to use eye-gaze technology. Although she had tried different sorts of assistive technology in the years following her diagnosis, this had often proved frustrating and uncomfortable. But using her eyes to operate the computer was a huge improvement, and in 2012 she began using this tech to create art with a software program called Revelation Natural Art.As for her art practice: “I feel like it’s still developing. I’m still learning about the art software I use.” Her colourful paintings can take months to complete, but, she says: “I’ve always been very determined, my mum calls it stubborn!”Ezekiel is also glad to support other artists using this technology. “I know a few eye-gaze artists, but art is a very inidual practice and we all do our own thing. I’m often asked about the software I use and for advice, which I’m always happy to give.”The technology is also becoming more accessible to other users. Microsoft is now on hand to offer guidance and support to potential eye-gaze artists, or anyone who wants to use assistive technology with their products. The company has worked on bringing eye-gaze technology to more users and, as a result, Windows 10 includes built-in tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. This enables people with disabilities to use a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C version Ezekiel uses, which unlocks the Windows operating system. Users will then be able to operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard using just their eyes. This tech also enables text-to-speech, so when someone has typed a phrase or sentence using their eye tracker, this text can then be “spoken” by the computer.Ezekiel is very keen to improve access to technology for other people who are no longer able to speak or express themselves. And for herself, she stresses that there is always more to find out and more ways to develop as an artist. “Eye-gaze painting is very different to using hands and it’s still a learning curve for me.”Sarah Ezekiel’s art is available via her website sarahezekielWhether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

The south coast is more popular with holidaymakers: it’s all about surfing, sailing and sandcastles on its long, sandy beaches.Day one Shop for fruit and veg and all manner of worldly goods at the popular Wednesday market in Pwllheli – handy if you arrive by train, as it’s right by the station. Alternatively, wait until Sunday when the market stalls sell more local produce. Stop for fish and chips at Allports, where the chips come double-fried to order. Pwllheli boasts sandy beaches, Plas Heli – the Welsh National Sailing Academy – and the Hafan Pwllheli Marina, so there are plenty of sailing and yacht-ogling options.Day three Surf the waves rolling in from the Irish Sea at one of the long bays on the peninsula’s south coast. Hell’s Mouth (Porth Neigwl), between the headlands of Mynydd Penarfynydd and Mynydd Cilan, has the most reliable surf breaks. Its long, gentle, shelving beach suits swimmers, body boarders and kayakers, too. At the sheltered beach at Porthor, on the north coast, body boarders may even come nose-to-nose with a seal. Porthor has “whistling sands” – slide bare feet along the beach and listen to it squeak.Day four Be a pilgrim and walk part of the 135-mile-long North Wales Pilgrim’s Way (Taith Pererin Gogledd Cymru) to the end of the peninsula. Pick it up at the last leg, from Porthor to Aberdaron (about three miles). Then catch a ferry to Ynys Enlli (Bardsey Island) from Porth Meudwy (£32.50 adult, £20 child, book in advance on bardseyboattrips), where, according to legend, 20,000 saints are buried. Be warned: the strong tides and currents mean that the crossing can be choppy and infrequent.Stay Bert’s Kitchen Garden (three-nights from £133 to £145 per pitch based on four sharing, pre-pitched tents also available) in Trefor is an eco-campsite with 15 pitches, communal campfires, a private shingle beach and a cafe in a converted campervan.A solitary road alongside Loch Sunart runs through this remote peninsula in the north-west Highlands. Wild, sparsely inhabited and unspoilt, it is the westernmost point of the UK mainland and the place to go for unhurried exploration of beaches, mountains, forest and moorland, taking in wildlife along the way.Day one Gen up on local wildlife at the Ardnamurchan natural history visitor centre. The area is rich in wildlife, including otters, pine martens, golden eagles and wild cats. Some – pine martens, field voles and swallows – make their way to the Living Building, built to encourage a variety of creatures to make it their home. Visitors can walk through this turf-roofed timber building to experience simulations of various habitats, including a wild cat den and a wood at night. Its Lochview Tearoom serves full Scottish breakfasts and light lunches, or buy sandwiches and cake to take away.Day two Hire a bike from Sunart Cycles (£20 a day) and either pedal independently or ask for a pre-planned tour. Bikes can be dropped off for no extra charge in the towns of Acharacle and Salen. Cycling on the peninsula itself is restricted mostly to the main road, which can get busy in summer. There are cycle paths on the other side of Loch Sunart in Morvern, however, which include routes through nature reserves and the ancient forest of Ariundle Oakwood. Suitable for hybrid and mountain bikes, there are several challenging off-road tracks.Day three Climb Ben Hiant to get 360-degree views of the peninsula. Not as forbidding as it might sound, this extinct volcano is easy to scale – it’s a mere 528 metres high and there is a clear path to the top. As you ascend, look out for signs of pine martens and red deer. If visibility is good, you can see the islands of Muck, Eigg and Rum, Mull, Coll and Tiree from the top, as well as the rest of Ardnamurchan spilling out before you. Ben Hiant is loosely translated as Holy or Blessed Mountain, which may be a nod to the ancient burial ground nearby, at the bay of Camas nan Gaell.Day four Otter Adventures can guide you on a variety of kayak and canoe outings on Loch Sunart, including a Sea Kayak and a Family Canoe Adventure. With a guide (and other canoeists), you get to stop off at otherwise inaccessible islands and forests, or light a fire and brew a cup of tea. There may also be seals. Journeys take up most of the day and cost £80 adult, £50 child.Day five Pack provisions and head to Sanna Bay, at the tip of the peninsula, as there is nothing to buy when you arrive. A remote and lovely spot with soft white sand beaches, turquoise seas and flower-rich machair in spring and summer, it is easy to spend hours here doing nothing very much apart from a spot of rockpooling or beachcombing. There are plenty of wildlife-spotting opportunities, too: sand martens nest in the dune cliffs otters forage along the shore butterflies feed on wildflowers you may even spot a white-tailed eagle.Stay Keeper’s West cottage (sleeps four, from £428 to £676 a week) sits beneath the Ardnamurchan Lighthouse at the edge of the peninsula. Tir Nan Og (sleeps six, from £340 to £640 a week) is a simple whitewashed stone cottage, minutes away from the white sand beach of Sanna Bay.The vast, shimmering sands of Morecambe Bay may look beguiling but the quicksand and mudflats are notoriously dangerous. Best to admire these from the shore and explore its estuaries, islands and resorts instead.Day one Stop for coffee at the Ravilious Rotunda Bar at the Midland Hotel – non-residents are welcome. This art deco smasher, with its curvilinear white facade, has become a destination in its own right. Sit by a window and look out over Morecambe Bay’s seemingly never-ending expanse. On 31 August–1 September, Hemingway Designs is holding its annual Vintage By The Sea Festival (free entry) at the hotel. Expect many moustachioed and red-lipsticked retro enthusiasts enjoying the vintage fairground, live music, market and classic cars.Day two Walk south on Morecambe’s promenade to the very end – about three miles, depending on where you start. This flat and undemanding route, also ideal for cycling, skirts Morecambe Bay. You might see wading birds such as oystercatchers and turnstone digging around in the mudflats for food – especially at low tide when they are driven closer to the promenade. You’ll definitely see the wonderful statue of Eric Morecambe in one of his characteristic poses with a pair of binoculars around his neck (he was a keen ornithologist). At the prom’s end, walk up to Heysham Head and the ruined eighth-century St Patrick’s Chapel (rumoured to be where St Patrick came ashore following a shipwreck), which has great views of the bay. And look out for the body-shaped pre-Norman graves, carved out of rock and facing towards the ocean.Day three Fortify yourself with breakfast at View Café, decorated with vinyl and music memorabilia. A designated Spam Menu includes Spam fritters, but there are other, more contemporary – and more appealing – options. Hire a bike at Morecambe station from Bike and Go (£10 for an annual subscription, then £3.80 a day), then join the Bay Cycle Way and pedal part of the route out of Morecambe, heading north along the coast. (Its entire length, from Walney Island in Barrow-in-Furness to Glasson Dock in Lancaster, is 81 miles.) Plotted by Sustrans, it takes cyclists on traffic-free paths and quiet lanes wherever possible (get a map, which includes several day rides at sustrans.org.uk, £13).Day four Catch the train from Lancaster to Grange-over-Sands (or from Morecambe and change) and travel over the 505-metre-long viaduct that snakes across the estuary of the River Kent. On arrival, check out the station, with its elegant red-and-green wrought iron pillars supporting glass platform canopies. Grange-over-Sands was a popular resort during the Victorian sea-bathing craze and still has a rarefied air. Its sheltered position means it also has many subtropical plants along the promenade and in the Ornamental Gardens. It’s not the place to swim, however: at extreme low tides, the sea can be around 10 miles away.Day five Have an audience with the King of Piel Island. This 50-acre kingdom off the tip of Furness peninsula, Barrow-in-Furness, comprises a ruined 14th-century castle, a row of houses and the Ship Inn. The landlord, Steve Chattaway, is also the king – a title he inherited with ownership of the pub. You can camp here (£5 per tent, must be pre-booked) and the pub also serves food, but most visitors come for the day. In high season (April-Sept), catch the ferry from Roa Island, which is connected to the mainland by an isthmus (daily 11am-4.30pm, weather permitting, adult £5 return, child £3). Piel Island is also accessible on foot at low tide from Walney Point, but be warned: it’s risky as swift tides can leave you stranded.Stay Gibraltar Farm campsite (from £14 per tent) in Silverdale is a working farm in the Arnside \u0026amp Silverdale AONB, with views of Morecambe Bay and its own ancient woodland. For groups, camping in a designated area in the woods is £160 a night for up to 10 tents. Wolf House Cottages are two self-catering properties near the village of Silverdale: the Coach House sleeps six, from £575 to £795 a week the Old Cottage sleeps four adults and two children, from £495 to £580 a week.Often overlooked in favour of its neighbour, the quainter fishing village of Staithes, or the mighty harbour that is Whitby, Saltburn-by-the-Sea is a Victorian seaside resort that remains steadfastly unchanged. It still has its original pier and lift, a funicular railway that takes passengers from the clifftop town down to the massive, sandy beach.Day one Step into the imagination of Henry Pease, a Victorian Quaker and industrialist, who literally dreamt up Saltburn in 1858: a celestial vision prompted him to create a town on the edge of a cliff and turn its glen into pleasure grounds. The result is a dignified town with substantial houses overlooking the beach, streets named after jewels (Pearl Street, Ruby Street, Emerald Street) and a very long pier (see below). It also has a variety of independent shops – check out Chocolini’s for handmade chocolates, and Lillian Daph for Scandi-style homeware. Then promenade through the Valley Gardens, whose winding paths cross a stream, go through woodland, and pass formal gardens and a colonnaded gazebo.Day two Plummet to the beach from the town in the Victorian, water-powered lift. The cliff lift deposits passengers at the entrance of the 200-metre-long pier, which extends across the wind-blown sand at low tide and over rolling waves at high. It has absolutely nothing on it except dog walkers and the occasional seabird – a place to go to clear the head and gulp salty air. The beach is a well-regarded surf spot, and although the sea can get lively, there are good beginner’s waves on either side of the pier. Saltburn Surf School has been teaching folk to surf here for over 30 years and offers private lessons (£50 an hour for one person, £60 for two).Day three Hunt for fossils among the rocks and shingle on the beach. The entire coast between Saltburn and Scarborough is the stuff of geography field trips, and packed with Jurassic geological interest. Saltburn beach is backed by the sheer rock of Huntcliff, whose erosion has revealed ammonites, crinoids and belemnites, and fossilised wood. Staithes, Robin Hood’s Bay and Runswick Bay are all good fossil-hunting grounds.Day four Spend a few hours in the village of Sandsend, a 30-minute drive along the coast. There is not a whole heap to do here except enjoy its massive (four mile) sandy beach and look around its well-scrubbed village: stone cottages with red roofs, some of which are holiday accommodation, sit in front of immaculate lawns beside a stream that rushes towards the sea. A sprinkle of shops includes a good general store and cafe. Eat well for a reasonable price at the Bridge Cottage Bistro, which serves an imaginative menu including many dishes involving locally caught fish. Alternatively, plump for a Whitby crab sandwich on the deck of the Sandside Cafe, inches from the beach.Day five Visit Staithes to see why it has inspired so many artists, past and present. Park at the top of the town and walk down its steep main street to the harbour, wandering into intriguing-looking alleys along the way. Call in at Dotty’s Vintage Tearoom for a buttered tea cake and a pot of tea among vintage collectibles. The Cod and Lobster Inn on the harbour wall is as close as you could get to the sea: waves lash against its front door at high tide. At low tide, the rocky shoreline platform outside is exposed – good rockpooling territory.Stay Coastguard Cottage (sleeps four, from £320 to £650 a week) is one of a row of houses perched above Saltburn beach on the Cleveland Way. The Spa Hotel (doubles from £109 a night B\u0026ampB) sits above the beach, has views of the sea and cliffs, and offers Surf and Stay packages which include lessons.Traces of Orford’s past can be detected in its ex-fishermen’s cottages, busy quayside and hulks of old boats sinking into the mud. This pretty village is a mixture of the delightful and the beguilingly sinister: the former military testing site and shingle bank, Orford Ness, stretch out alongside.Day one Pick up breakfast from Pump Street Bakery in Market Square: all of its naturally leavened bread and pastries are made in the village, and it makes its own small-batch chocolate. Nip into Pinney’s for picnic supplies – the shop beside its smokehouse sells its own smoked fish, and wet fish caught daily on its boats. Orford General Store is an excellent village shop selling local cheese, fruit and veg, and just about everything else you may need, including maps.Day three Motor south along the coast towards the estuary of the River Deben, stopping at Shingle Street – a lonely row of ex-fishermen’s cottages (now holiday accommodation) evacuated in 1940 under mysterious circumstances. Sit on the beach, soak up the atmosphere, or go for a swim. Stop for lunch at The Ramsholt Arms (the lunch menu includes handmade faggots, local ham steak and veggie options), and watch yachts sail by from its deck overlooking the estuary.Day four Tune into your animal spirit with a goat yoga session – the goats wander among you – at Skylark Farm (£15, book in advance) in Bawdsey, held on Sunday mornings and Tuesday evenings. Goat pettingmilking sessions can also be arranged as a child-friendly option. Drive on to Felixstowe, and either marvel at the Tetris-like dexterity of the crane drivers at the container port, stroll through the recently restored Seafront Gardens, or swim in the sea (rated “excellent” water quality by the Environment Agency). The beach is a mixture of shingle and sand.Day five Climb aboard the Lady Florence, a lovely wooden second world war supply ship, for a lunch or supper cruise. Departing from Orford Quay, the three-hour trip along the rivers Alde and Ore goes past Orford Ness to Shingle Street and the North Sea, before returning. It also circumnavigates Havergate Island bird sanctuary. Alternatively, a breakfast cruise will take you upstream to Aldeburgh and back, as you eat hot muffins on deck. Twelve passengers per cruise, £22.50pp, meal extra, rivercruiserestaurants.Stay Daphne Cottage (sleeps two, from £485 to £795 a week) is a Grade II-listed Victorian cottage with a small garden at the front and a patio at the back.The twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth peer over the sea from the precipitous cliffs of the north Devon coast. Exmoor is close by, to the south, and the cliffs and gorges are threaded with numerous walking trails, rocky coves and hidden beaches.Day one Ascend from the Esplanade at Lynmouth to its sister town of Lynton on the Cliff Railway. There’s no better way to get up a cliff than sitting in a bottle-green carriage of a Victorian funicular railway as it steadily makes its way to the top. Two carriages work in tandem – one goes up as the other goes down – propelled by the gravity pull of water discharged from tanks fitted to each. At the top, a giant scone awaits in the cafe as part of a Devon cream tea, plus views of the coast curling out of sight. Day two Walk to the Valley of Rocks. A 20-minute walk from the Cliff Railway along clearly marked paths will take you to a U-shaped dry valley that runs parallel to the coast. A spectacular smattering of shattered rocks populated by feral goats (and, in high season, coachloads of tourists), it has inspired Romantic artists (Samuel Palmer), poets (Coleridge, Wordsworth) and novelist RD Blackmore, who set parts of Lorna Doone here. Free guided walks to Hollerday Hill and the Valley of Rocks leave Lynton Town Hall throughout the summer.Day four Discover a secret(ish) cove. Pack lunch and a book, and scramble down to Wringcliff Bay, following a path from the roundabout in the Valley of Rocks. It takes a bit of effort to reach it – it is accessible only by a steep footpath, so children should probably avoid it – but the peacefulness of the place is worth it. The small sandy beach is sheltered by steep cliffs all around and is often deserted. Strong currents mean it is not advisable to swim far out but paddling is highly recommended, as is sitting on a rock and watching the waves. Dogs are allowed.Day five Explore Combe Martin, a seaside resort that runs ribbon-like along the bottom of a valley with a sheltered (and popular) sandy beach. Pick up some homemade pork pies and pasties from the Combe Martin Farm Shop, then spend the day rockpooling, or hire a kayak or two from Surfside Kayak Hire and go looking for hidden coves and dolphins. Alternatively, take the South West Coast Path out of town and walk to the vertiginous Hangman Hills, the highest sea cliffs in England. (Combe Martin is also where the Hunting of the Earl of Rone – a custom involving villagers dressing up and chasing the Earl of Rone through the town – takes place every May.)Tucked behind a shingle ridge, a stroll from the soft sands of Camber and three miles from the cobbled lanes of Rye, the village of Winchelsea Beach still feels undiscovered. Pre-war railway-carriage homes sit beside wooden beach huts, bungalows and smart, contemporary dwellings, giving the area an appealingly ramshackle and curious air.Day one Stock up on supplies for the week at Salts Farm Shop just north-west of Rye, which sells Kentish Mayde pies, free-range eggs from a farm in Battle, and beer from Romney Marsh Brewery. Head up the hill to the Winchelsea Farm Kitchen for good quality meat, wine and other deli delights. On the way back, drop in at The Clam, a new Camber cafe serving all-day brunch – tasty sourdough toast toppings include tahini, blood orange, pistachio and honey – and steak tacos.Day two Stay local and make the most of Camber Sands on your doorstep. This four-mile stretch lined with dunes is one of the few sandy beaches along this coastline, and the place to head with a picnic and a beach towel. Even at busy times it’s possible to find a quiet spot to put up a windbreak (advised – it can get very blowy). The Kitesurf Centre and Rye Water Sports offer kitesurfing and paddleboarding lessons.Day three Head out to Romney Marsh and explore its 14 medieval churches, rising in splendid isolation from the flat land. Built by lords of the manor to serve now-vanished communities, and also as a display of wealth, most are open to visitors. Don’t miss St Thomas à Becket at Fairfield, which has appeared in various TV programmes, including Great Expectations. End the day in an open-sided carriage of a one-third size steam locomotive on the Romney, Hythe \u0026amp Dymchurch Railway. Buy a return ticket and hop on at nearby Dungeness for a sweet little chug along the coast to Hythe and back (rover ticket £18.60 adult, £9.30 child, less for shorter journeys).Day four Walk to Rye Harbour Nature Reserve – a land of gravel pits, lagoons, marsh and shingle. An important conservation site, you could spot avocets nesting in the saltmarsh or marsh harriers hunting in the reedbeds. Walk to a bird hide along wooden boardwalks (look out for yellow horned-poppies, sea kale and sea campion in the shingle along the way) and wait. The Avocet Gallery in Rye Harbour village serves tea and cake (Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays) and showcases (and sells) the work of top-quality local artists, designers and makers.Day five Go for a beachcomber’s lunch at The Gallivant and tuck into local specialities like saltmarsh lamb and fish from the Hastings fleet (but don’t bring young children – this hotelrestaurant next to Camber Sands welcomes over-10s only). Head up the hill and enter Winchelsea through one of its medieval gates. Now a quietly delightful town perched high on a ridge a mile inland, it was once an important port and the centre of the wine trade. Book a guided tour around its vaulted cellars – a great rainy-day option – to get a taste of the town’s medieval past.Stay Seashells (sleeps five, from £1,150 to £1,400 a week) is a new, light and airy beach house on Camber Sands with a large gated garden. The same owner rents out Pebbles Beach House (sleeps five, £1,299 a week high season, £165 a night low season – two-night minimum), an airy, shabby-chic wooden bolthole on the shingle at Winchelsea Beach.The Isle of Portland isn’t actually an island – it’s a chunk of limestone tethered to the mainland by the shingle tombolo that is Chesil Beach – but it still feels apart from the mainland, and the rest of the Jurassic Coast.Day one Take a look around the scattered settlements of Portland, keeping an eye open for buildings built from Portland stone. Drop by Tout Quarry nature reserve and sculpture park, where much of the stone was quarried (and ended up in Buckingham Palace and St Paul’s Cathedral, among other places) and which now has 60 hidden sculptures to discover along meandering paths. The Portland Museum, a community project founded by birth-control pioneer Marie Stopes and housed in two thatched cottages, is a good place to learn more. It was also the inspiration for the heroine’s cottage in Thomas Hardy’s The Well-Beloved.Day two Continue explorations by venturing to Portland Bill, which overlooks the roiling waves of Portland Race. This whirl of tides and currents, combined with the Shambles sandbank, is why this rocky promontory has three lighthouses. Climb up the automated candy-striped one to understand the nature of the ship-wrecking waters that surround it. Drop in at the visitor centre, once the home of the lighthouse keepers, and learn more with the help of interactive displays, then feast on crab sandwiches at The Lobster Pot next door.Day three Head along Chesil Beach to Abbotsbury. Chesil Beach runs beyond the pretty, thatched village of Abbotsbury, parallel to the coast to West Bay, framing Fleet Lagoon. This brackish lake is home to the 600 mute swans at the Swannery at Abbotsbury. Help to feed them at noon and 4pm daily, then sample Abbotsbury mackerel and other sustainably sourced fish at the Taste Café in the Chesil Beach visitor centre, which has views over the lagoon and beach.Day four Get out on to the water at Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy in Portland Harbour, which hosted the sailing events at the 2012 Olympics and is now a centre of sailing excellence. The RYA-accredited Andrew Simpson Centre offers sailing taster sessions for £20 an hour. There are also plenty of other opportunities locally to snorkel, canoe, swim, scuba e to shipwrecks, and fish. Head into Weymouth and refuel with fish and chips at The Old Harbour restaurant, followed by a game of whack-a-mole in the amusement arcade on the beach for the full-on seaside experience.Day five Visit the labyrinthine Northe Fort at the mouth of Weymouth harbour, which was built in 1872 to defend the Portland naval base from Napoleon III. Now a visitor attraction, it also has a reputation as a haunted site. Alternatively, hop aboard a wooden second world war naval boat and let a bewhiskered skipper take you on a 1½-hour trip along the Jurassic Coast. Boats leave from Weymouth harbour (£14). On the way back to base, stop for a drink at the Cove House Inn – sit outside and enjoy the sight of Chesil Beach stretching out before you.Stay The Old Higher Lighthouse cottages (each sleeps four, from £450 to £1,000 a week) on Portland Bill, have the sea views you’d expect from a lighthouse plus shared use of a pool and hot tub. Alternatively, 50 Ocean Views (sleeps four, from £490 to £1,154 a week) is a smart contemporary apartment with a private terrace and sea views.The cool, wooded creeks and tucked-away coves of the River Helford are a welcome escape from the busy beaches and bustle of nearby Falmouth. It’s all about the life aquatic here, whether it’s watching small boats and yachts from the footpath or the terrace of an agreeable pub, or taking to the water in a kayak.Day one Sink a pint on the terrace outside The Ferryboat Inn at Helford Passage. This popular pub sits beside the river above a beach, and is a good viewpoint for gazing over the estuary and watching small boats bob about. The menu changes daily and includes pub food classics and inventive fish dishes (mackerel tacos, seabass linguine). It’s a prime position for watching the Helford Passage Regatta (10 August) and is also the place to catch the ferry across the river to Helford, see below, and to pick up the South West Coast Path.Day three Paddle through the creeks and coves of the River Helford. Slipping quietly through the water in a small boat is the best way to get to know the river and its forested valleys, witness its wildlife close up, explore the inlets that probe inland, and pull up at one of its quieter beaches and go for a dip. St Anthony Sailaway on Gillan Creek at the entrance of the river hires out single and double kayaks and rowing boats for £13-15 an hour. Koru Kayaking runs guided two-hour kayaking adventures for £40, setting off from the private beach at Budock Vean Hotel.Day four Visit convalescing seals in Gweek. Started when Ken Jones rescued a baby seal washed up on the beach in 1958, the Cornish Seal Sanctuary now has five pools and a hospital where it cares for orphaned, sick or injured animals – not just seals: otters, goats, ponies and penguins are all looked after here. Once recovered, most seals are returned to the sea: those that wouldn’t survive, stay on as “guests”. Stay Kestle Cottage (sleeps four, from £395 to £1,295 a week), near Frenchman’s Creek, is one of several holiday homes in recently converted farm buildings. Creek View (sleeps four, £317 to £939 a week) is an apartment above Helford Village Stores with a gorgeous view over the estuary. Bosvathick House B\u0026ampB (doubles £110 a night, singles £70)is a grand private home in Constantine, a short drive from the estuary, with stately rooms, a laurel maze and rolling grounds (gardens open in peak season). Day one Stock up on locally produced food and craft at the monthly market, held in Portaferry’s restored market house (first Saturday of the month, 10am-1.30pm). Portaferry sits at the southern end of the peninsula near the Narrows – the turbulent channel linking Strangford Lough to the Irish Sea – and is where to catch the ferry to the other side of the Lough. Sit outside the Portaferry Hotel with a coffee and wait for the ferry to arrive, or duck inside to eat seafood dishes, including bouillabaisse and lobster.Day two Make your way three miles up the road from Portaferry to Kearney, a former fishing village restored in vernacular style by the National Trust. Now fully occupied, the simple whitewashed cottages tucked between drumlins (hillocks) and the sea, present a sanitised but appealing impression of what life was like in a 19th-century fishing village. In one cottage lived Mary Ann Doonan, captain of the so-called “she-cruiser”, a ship crewed entirely by women, and something of a local legend. The sandy beach of Knockinelder is close by and is a lovely spot for a dip.Day three Hire a canoe and explore one of Strangford Lough’s 100-plus islands, many of them rich in seabirds and other wildlife you may even spot seals and otters as you go. Outdoor Recreation NI, which manages and promotes outdoor activities in Northern Ireland, has devised a series of canoe trails, which can be found, along with a list of canoe providers, at canoeni. One canoe trail leads to Salt Island, where you can stay overnight in a bothy – it has a woodburner and a flushing toilet but no cooker (sleeps 10, £10pp sharing, £80 for exclusive use).Day four Drive around to the other side of Strangford Lough to the Castle Epsie Wetland Centre (which is just 12 miles south-east of Belfast). Blending with the shoreline of the Lough, its 25 hectares of tidal lagoons, salt marsh, woodland and reed beds are home to countless birds, bats and insects, and a stopping-off point for migrating brent geese. Watch the avian comings and goings from one of the hides, or walk among ducks, ducklings and geese in the duckery. On the way back, stop off at Daft Eddy’s, a smart modern restaurant by the side of the Lough, for Portavogie scampi and a pint of Guinness.Day five Visit Grey Abbey House and Gardens in Newtownards to inspect a fine example of a big old Irish Georgian house. Located on the side of the Lough, the grounds have a walled and vegetable gardens, and two orchards of Victorian fruit trees and Irish apple trees. The expansive estate includes a lake and ancient woodland inhabited by red squirrels. Close by are the ruins of a Norman Cistercian priory, dissolved by Henry VIII. Up the road is Harrisons of Grey Abbey, a nursery, farm shop and popular restaurant.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

It, in fact, drives deep into the heart of what makes Actual Gogglebox so good – the sheer humanity of the people in it their tendernesses, their quirks, their choice of biscuits the way all the mums sit with a cushion on their laps – and tears it out and kills it, putting recognisable faces front-and-centre instead. Some celebrities are good value (Rylan, who is long overdue his knighthood now, watching Channel 4 docs about gay dogs with his frequently baffled mum), and some are absolutely not (Chris Eubank, carefully and insanely wearing a sheriff’s badge at all times, explaining incredibly simple subjects to his large adult son). But the problem here is not the quality of the celebrities it’s more the fact that they are even celebrities at all.Here’s how I can best explain it: Celebrity Gogglebox is a performance whereas Actual Gogglebox is not. This can’t be helped: the people here are performers, and they are never not performing, even when they are not performing. Little Mix are always being Little Mix, aren’t they? They were taught to be Little Mix a few seconds after leaving school and they’ve been Little Mix ever since. When they are squabbling about what cake to eat in front of the telly, they are still fundamentally Little Mix. Rylan is always being Rylan. Eamonn Holmes is always the TV approximation of Eamonn Holmes. Toff is here, from I’m a Celebrity…, having graduated from Made in Chelsea, and there is something sordid-feeling about that – that Gogglebox has become yet another stop along the appearance-fee-and-then-out promotional circuit, just another Celeb Come Dine With Me or ITV2 panel show where someone’s got a book to sell.Gogglebox, Actual Gogglebox, is about people in mismatched pyjamas taking complicated tea orders from four people who all have their own place on the sofa. It’s about eating a yoghurt your mum was saving for later and getting gently chided for doing so. It’s about that lazy, fuggy air of domesticity: getting a curry in because no one can be arsed to cook. The Dog Has Made A Smell. And that’s what I want not beautiful people with stylists and makeup artists performing an act of enjoying TV. I want Jenny and Lee, stranded in a static home outside Hull. There is already too much Eamonn Holmes on my television. I don’t want him watching it with me as well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17a00a80b051fe8695641b743be772d38c74731e/237_115_2518_1511/master/2518.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f11301cf0f2556f3da7fb5e00f9808af","title":"shipmates review channel 4","story":"A parade of perfectly buffed party animals don their swimwear to compete for a meaningless prize. Remind you of anything?I think it’s clear now – and probably has been for several years to those who keep a courageously watchful eye on these things – that the producers of reality TV shows are having a contempt-off. Meetings must now consist of them sitting round a bucket, hurling pieces of dog excrement into it as they call out the most derivative, asinine, morally bankrupt ideas they can think of. When the bucket is full, they mould the contents into a programme.And so to Channel 4’s Shitmates – Shipmates in its official listing, but that need not detain us here. The conceit? It’s Love Island on a ship. Thassit. If you’ve ever seen Love Island – or absorbed its basics through cultural osmosis – and a ship, you have its essence.I watch them all with the fascinated gaze of a time-travelling Victorian anthropologist. I am baffled by but eager to comprehend the social and inner workings of a species superficially the same as my own and yet so far removed from it. I must take copious notes to returning to my Royal Society brethren for further understanding.There is, in these situations, always a MacGuffin that requires lots of young, attractive people to be brought together on camera to be filmed in their swimwear. This time, it has been decreed that two groups on a cruise round the Med will compete to win a trip to Bali by becoming the most popular, as voted for by all 1,500 passengers on board. We are not told how this popularity will be attained. I think it might be by who spreads the least chlamydia. But, notepad and pencil in hand, let me creep closer to watch events unfold.There are 10 of the usual suspects: perfectly buffed, coiffed, occasionally augmented twentysomethings, built from extruded plastic and delivered from the factory with their original settings active. They are all pathologically confident, enthusiastic, up for a shared vision of a good time and dementedly happy (except when sobbing at a slight real or imagined).Five friends – Sean, Charlotte, Maddi, Lewis and Ashley – are on one team. They are also on another team, but this time they are called Ed, Lauren, Georgia, Jay and Jordan. Or maybe they are different people. Charlotte has a thing for Lewis and they once had a thing together. But Lewis is developing a thing for Lauren. Lauren does not have a thing for Lewis, though she might have a thing for Ed even though Georgia might also have a thing for Ed and they nearly once had a thing together, but she might let Lewis think she has a thing for him if it helps them win the MacGuffin.They compete in deck games that not-so-inadvertently bring their primary and secondary sexual characteristics into occasional contact, with much screaming delight among the 10 and many prayers for death from me.They party, which even-less-inadvertently brings their primary and secondary sexual characteristics into contact with other guests’. This occasions much sobbing from Charlotte (who feels “disrespected” by Lewis because he has not brought his sexual characteristics into contact with hers tonight, maybe ever. I am not sure at this point. I am only sure who Charlotte is because she told us she once bruised her feefee and it “swelled up like a golf ball”. I must consult upon what exactly a feefee is on my return.)They deal with unexpected arrivals – “stowaways”, in the parlance of the organisers. One is Maddi’s work colleague Nadine. Everyone likes Nadine, but because Nadine is old enough to remember the first smartphones they do not know how to use Nadine to boost their popularity. Nadine is lucky there are no ice floes in the Med – she would find herself adrift in no time. The other stowaway is Josh, with whom Georgia once had a thing on holiday. He would still have a thing with her but she is not sure she wants another thing with him. I am getting the measure of this tribe and think it may only be a matter of time, especially if she cannot have a thing with Ed.My notebook is full. It is strange. I feel there is much to learn here and yet my brain is starting to leak out of my ears. It is time, I think, to jump ship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eb3bfc6efaf1e15c969c39a6beea1529d557c82/28_163_3199_1919/master/3199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e17131d0c88f628b81c6631b8c3ffc2a","title":"is a new generation taking over the democratic party podcast","story":"Kamala Harris was the big winner of the first round of Democratic party debates in the US.

Will the Democrats coalesce around a centrist such as Biden, a former vice-president? Or could they opt for the more radical figure of Bernie Sanders, four years after he lost out to Hillary Clinton? Or will the torch pass to a new generation? Also today: Daniel Boffey on the changing of the guard in the European Union’s clutch of top jobs and what it could mean for the Brexit negotiations.

He just wants to wear a vest. What is his sin?” asked one person.Jinan is not alone in abhorring the exposed stomach, with the municipality of Tianjin posting a notice earlier this year saying people could be fined up to 200 yuan if they went shirtless in a public place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea725d9acba71addd0e69e9acb2923ee2a26678/0_107_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31748a130b6861f1776401ccee8c59f8","title":"iran says it is ready to enrich uranium beyond nuclear deal levels","story":"Tehran says it will increase enrichment because Europe has ‘indirectly violated’ nuclear dealA top aide to Iran’s supreme leader says the Islamic Republic is ready to enrich uranium beyond the level set by Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal, just before a deadline it set on Sunday for Europe to offer new terms to the accord.A video message by Ali Akbar Velayati included him saying that “Americans directly and Europeans indirectly violated the deal,” part of Tehran’s hardening tone with Europe. European parties to the deal have yet to offer a way for Iran to avoid the sweeping economic sanctions imposed by Donald Trump since he pulled the US out of the accord a year ago, especially those targeting its crucial oil sales.It comes as America has sent thousands of troops, an aircraft carrier, nuclear-capable B-52 bombers and advanced fighter jets to the Middle East. Mysterious oil tanker attacks near the strait of Hormuz, attacks by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen on Saudi Arabia and Iran shooting down a US military drone have raised fears of a wider conflict engulfing the region.Iran argues that it is no longer bound by the cap because of the withdrawal of the US from the agreement, and the reimposition of economic sanctions Donald Trump.In the video, available on a website for the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Velayati said that increasing enrichment closer to weapons-grade levels was “unanimously agreed upon by every component of the establishment”.“We will show reaction exponentially as much as they violate it. We reduce our commitments as much as they reduce it,” said Velayati, Khamenei’s adviser on international affairs. “If they go back to fulfilling their commitments, we will do so as well.”On Monday, Iran and United Nations inspectors acknowledged it had broken the stockpile limit. Combining that with increasing its enrichment levels narrows the one-year window experts believe Iran would need to have enough material to build a nuclear weapon, if it chose to do so.“This would be a very worrisome step that could substantially shorten the time Iran would need to produce the material needed for nuclear weapons,” said Miles Pomper, a senior fellow at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies’ James Marin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. “Both Iran and the Trump administration should be looking for ways to de-escalate the crisis, rather than exacerbate it.”In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.The US said its ambassador to international organisations in Vienna, Jackie Wolcott, had requested a special meeting of the IAEA to discuss its “latest, concerning report on the Iran regime’s nuclear program.” That meeting is planned for Wednesday.Iran’s diplomatic mission to Vienna, where the IAEA is based, called the US move “a sad irony” as America had unilaterally withdrawn from the deal a year ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9ca86eb1690cfbac115bbbd00c1f8488e29fb4c/0_234_763_458/master/763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=299887b05346af61e4e4ea1d49199cce","title":"magid magid if you try to be everyones cup of tea you might as well be a mug","story":"Green party MEP never intended to fit the mould and hopes his election sends a message to nationalists across the EUIt’s a long way from the Glastonbury stage to the European parliament chamber in Strasbourg. Magid Magid, one of Britain’s newest MEPs, is probably the only politician who has appeared at both venues this week.Magid, one of six MEPs for Yorkshire and the Humber, is not a typical politician. He is a black Muslim in a parliament where minority ethnic politicians have long been underrepresented. Nor does he bother with the typical male political uniform of suit and tie. He arrived for work in Strasbourg on Tuesday wearing green Dr Martens boots, Bermuda shorts, a yellow baseball cap worn backwards and a black T-shirt with the slogan “F**k Fascism”. His fluorescent Glastonbury band was still tied to his wrist. He had been at the festival speaking at an event on tackling racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism.Before his first day in Strasbourg was out, Magid was making headlines, after saying he had been asked to leave the parliament.The incident occurred as he left the Strasbourg debating chamber after the opening ceremony featuring Beethoven’s Ode to Joy on Tuesday. Magid claimed he encountered “someone in a suit” who asked him if he was lost. He did not think the person was trying to be helpful.The European parliament’s head of press said she had immediately investigated when Magid’s tweet came to her attention. “We can therefore safely say that no member of staff addressed Mr Magid in an inappropriate way.”Magid says he did not know who the man was, but confirmed it was not a European parliament usher in tailcoats or a security guard in a uniform.For him the incident shows: “We have all been socially conditioned to think what a politician or a MEP is meant to look like. And I completely get it. I don’t fit that mould and it’s never been my intention to fit that mould.”The 30-year old Green party MEP, who came to Britain as a refugee from Somalia, has been breaking the mould ever since he went into politics, becoming Sheffield’s lord mayor in 2018.Magid believes his election to the European parliament, on the slogan “immigrants make Britain great”, sends a message to nationalists across the continent, such as Italy’s far-right party leader, Matteo Salvini, or the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. “I epitomise everything that they stand against. Me being here does send a strong message to your Salvinis, to your Orbáns,” he says.While he has joined the European parliament’s home affairs and culture committees, his main focus will be at home. He is planning a regional tour to rally support ahead of a potential referendum. “If we did have a people’s vote, I don’t think we are as ready as we could be in all honesty.” He hopes to reach groups established political parties can struggle to reach. “I feel I can tap into a different demographic … whether that can be first-time voters or young people.”While a referendum is far from guaranteed, Magid argues voters should be offered a straight choice between remain and no deal.That will be seen as a risky choice. The EU argues that the UK would have to return to a version of the withdrawal agreement, if it wants a trading relationship with the EU, even after a no-deal Brexit.But he thinks he can tap into indifference and the lack of knowledge about British representation in the European Union. He recalls a campaign event at the University of Sheffield where “not a single person could name their MEP” or any benefits that came from the EU, “even in areas of Yorkshire where they had ridiculous amounts of money that had transformed their communities”.Magid studied aquatic zoology, ran a digital marketing business and worked for the homelessness charity Shelter before getting involved in politics, motivated by the rise of Ukip in the 2014 European elections.Within four years, he was being sworn in as lord mayor of Sheffield to the tune of the Imperial March from Star Wars and the Superman theme tune, as the Sheffield Star reported. He later made headlines by stating he would ban “wasteman” Donald Trump from the city – a measure not within his powers.His one-year tenure was not uncontroversial and he chafed at what he describes as the local council’s attempts to control his diary and messaging. “They wanted to control every aspect of everything especially when they realised the amount of engagement and traction I was getting.”The new MEP does not resile from “unapologetically being myself”, saying: “if you are trying to be everyone’s cup of tea you might as well be a mug”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a1c52af8b8e3573ed57f343a7b968a1015cc422/0_121_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87a668b0e52b19684338b9d8ec6366de","title":"pride in london organisers fend off pinkwashing claims","story":"30,000 people to take part in march that critics say has become too commercialisedPride in London 2019 - live updatesThe organisers of Pride in London have claimed Saturday’s event will be the most sustainable and erse in its 47-year history, despite criticism from some campaigners that it has become too regimented and commercialised.Peter Tatchell, one of the organisers of the UK’s first Pride parade in 1972, criticised local authority-imposed limits on marcher numbers. “In the 1990s over 100,000 marched, and similar numbers would probably march today if the parade was not restricted,” he said. “Pride has become so bureaucratic and regimented. LGBT+ iniduals cannot join the parade, only organisations.”He also voiced concerns that the onerous costs for road closures, barricades and parking suspensions imposed on Pride had forced it to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship. There was a danger of “pinkwashing”, he said. “Some corporates seem to see Pride as a marketing opportunity to target LGBT+ customers.”Organisers said pure marketing was not allowed on the parade, and the LGBT+ policies of all participating brands had been carefully examined.Activists have put up pro-refugee and anti-homelessness slogans on some of the capital’s buses in protest at what they say is the commercialisation of Pride in London.The campaign group Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants replaced bus advertisements with political messages along the Pride route. The “alternative ads” question why the Home Office, the politan police and global corporations are able to participate in this year’s Pride while “marginalised groups are left watching on the sidelines because they are unable to afford spaces on the march”.LGBT+ Pride month takes place in June to commemorate the Stonewall riots, which took place in 1969. These were a series of violent demonstrations led by the LGBT+ community in New York after a police raid at The Stonewall Inn. The following year the first gay pride marches took place in locations including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago. The first UK Pride march was in 1972.Fifty years later, Pride marches continue to take place around the world annually, both as a celebration of LGBT+ culture, and as a means of protesting homophobia and discrimination against the LGBT+ community.\u0026nbspIn some countries the marches take place despite continued opposition by local authorities. There are still over 70 countries in the world where homosexual relationships are criminalised. Pride marchers in the UK particularly point out that same-sex marriage is still not recognised in Northern Ireland, and that the UK\u0027s home office has been deporting LGBT+ people back to countries where their sexuality is outlawed.Read more: Stonewall at 50 - The riot that changed America\u0027s gay rights movement foreverOrganisers hope Pride will focus minds “in terms of people realising that the fight for equality is not yet won, and that even when things are enshrined in law, that you cannot sit back and take it for granted”, according to its co-chair Alison Camps.“You cannot be complacent,” she said. “We do not have equal marriage in Northern Ireland. The scenes in Birmingham are extremely distressing for those of us who are old enough to remember when section 28 was enforced, when there was no such thing as inclusive education, and the impact that had on young lives and people being free to be who they were.“So there is this sense we are at risk of going backwards. And Pride should be a time when we come together as a community to stand up for things that are right, and to fight for each other. That’s what I hope. I hope people have a good time. I want it to be joyful and I want it to be provocative.”Organisers said enhanced security would be in place to prevent anti-transgender activists from hijacking the event, after disruption last year. “Our position is they are not welcome,” Camps said. “They do not speak for the LGBT+ community. They do not speak for Pride in London. And our effort now focuses on making sure that the trans community, as well as everybody else, feels very safe, included, loved and valued at Pride in London.”Biodegradable glitter, water bottle filling points and a special stage showcasing black and minority ethnic artists are among measures to boost the parade’s green and inclusivity credentials.The LGBT+ equality charity Stonewall, which boycotted last year’s parade over claims the event was not erse enough, is back to join 30,000 marchers from 594 groups. After constructive talks with organisers, Stonewall said it was proud to be marching in partnership with UK Black Pride, Mermaids, which supports gender erse and transgender children and young people, and Level Up, a feminist organisation.“We sat down with Stonewall and listened to their feedback, took it on board and showed them what we are doing,” said Camps. “We have beefed up our community engagement, and worked with community organisations to launch a new world area celebrating the BAME LGBT+ community.”This year’s theme is Pride Jubilee, marking the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots – generally regarded as the birth of the Pride movement – as well as the 30th birthdays of both the Stonewall charity in the UK and the Albert Kennedy Trust, which helps homeless LGBT+ young people.Billy Porter, a star of the Broadway musical Kinky Boots, will headline the Trafalgar Square stage, appearing with performers including the Eurovision and X Factor singer Saara Aalto and stars from TV series RuPaul’s Drag Race. Artists appearing on the women’s stage in Leicester Square include Toya Delazy, Heather Peace and Four of Diamonds.The 30,000-strong parade will begin at midday at Portland Place and move through Oxford Circus, Regent Street, Piccadilly Circus, Lower Regent Street, Pall Mall and Trafalgar Square before finishing on Whitehall at about 5.30pm.The number of official marchers is up from 25,000 last year. Organisers said they had cut the number of wristbands given to corporate bodies to enable the inclusion of more community groups."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/723d4f329dc782b207132ed05f4331167ea0996a/1401_644_5871_3522/master/5871.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e1ac70ab672a357f0765db49ec46e64","title":"turban tying services boom young sikhs embrace heritage","story":"Professionals say it is now rare for family members to be able to tie groom’s turban before wedding At the height of wedding season, Jagdeep Singh Grewal professionally ties the turbans of four or five grooms a day. He is up before sunrise and often returns home long after dark. While the weddings can blur into each other, one incident has stayed with him.On a cold October morning in 2018, Grewal arrived at the groom’s house at 5am. The groom’s mother pointed to a picture of a man wearing a turban and asked him to mimic the style. As he got to work, stretching out the fabric, then stitching and tying the turban, Grewal was taken aback by how emotional the groom’s mother and uncle became. The family were moved by the groom’s resemblance to the man in the photo, who Grewal later learned was the groom’s father – a former soldier in the Indian army who had died. “I could relate to it because my dad isn’t around and it was a tough moment,” Grewal says.The 32-year-old runs Pagh Vala, a turban-tying service in London, with his friend and business partner Barinder Singh Bath. Theirs is part of a growing industry of bespoke turban-tying services in the UK, driven in part by younger members of the Sikh community displaying increasing pride in their roots and the rise of Bollywood stars such as Diljit Dosanjh bringing turbans into the spotlight.“It’s all about connecting people with their culture and heritage,” Grewal says. “We’ve become more westernised and we don’t know how to tie turbans. And it’s good we have embraced the western culture, but we should remember who we are.”“It used to be family members who tied the groom’s turban, but now you can hardly find a family member to tie a turban,” says Sukhvir Aujla, who runs Tying my Turban, a business based in Wolverhampton, with her husband Taranvir Dhanda.It’s not just turbans either. There are services for brides who want their saris pinned or gele headwraps professionally tied. Tokunbo Oluderu, a sales associate at Finetex Creatives, which sells fabrics for African headwraps and offers a wrapping service in London, says: “When we opened the shop, we saw a lot of people who came to buy a headwrap, but didn’t know what to do with it.”While the Highland store, based in London, largely hires and sells kilts to its customers, it is becoming more common to have to show customers how to correctly wear their outfits. “We have people who come here who say their grandad is a McDonald or something like that and they have not worn kilts before,” the sales assistant Monica Zalapicz explains. “We show them how to put the kilt on, which side to wear the kilt pin, and which tartan is most appropriate to their family clan.”Pete Singh, 39, the founder of Turban Pro, says: “Everyone wants to look good. It’s the main part of the outfit and your face is going to be in pictures, so you have to get the turban right.” He adds that he often works with “a” grooms who are quite fussy about styles and shapes.Dr Jasjit Singh of the University of Leeds, who studies religious and cultural transmission, says: “Community elders thought that the younger generation would move away from their heritage, but what we’re seeing is an increasing interest in understanding one’s roots.”Naroop Jhooti, 38, a London-based photographer and co-author of the book Turbans and Tales, says: “Forty years ago, wearing the turban meant you couldn’t get the job, or could face racial abuse, so the older generation would wear black and didn’t want to be noticed. They wanted to be able to fit in. But times are definitely changing. The younger generation are taking more pride in how their turbans look.”Singh agrees there is a greater pressure on migrants to conform in the 1960s, but “those born and bred in Britain now are comfortable to say they are British and wearing a turban doesn’t make them any less so. They are less prepared to compromise on their identity.”Business owners welcome the enthusiasm for professional turban tying, but add that the religious connotations should be respected. Gucci was recently heavily criticised for selling a headpiece resembling a turban.Kully, 30, who didn’t want to give his last name, hired Turban Pro for his wedding last year, saying he wanted it to look right and respect his culture. It was the first time he had worn one. “It really hurts your head and gives you a headache,” Kully says laughing, but adds that he really enjoyed wearing it. “Everyone complimented it, even the priest,” he says. It was the reaction from his dad, who has worn the turban his whole life, which he savoured the most. “He just looked at me and said: ‘Wow.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d9a93d707536619fed4097695570e91d48c0560/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea3103cd0124e2b16fa90b371b9d01a7","title":"pride london 2019 marchers 50 years since stonewall live","story":"Rolling coverage of LGBT celebrations in the British capital, with up to 1.5m people predicted to turn out in what could be the biggest event to dateJeremy Corbyn has been tweeting about Pride.The Labour leader wrote an article for Pink News yesterday urging everyone to reject what he said is a “horrible” anti-transgender rights campaign.Elsewhere, Theresa May’s office posted this video on Thursday after Downing Street hosted a Pride reception.And Tory leadership contender Jeremy Hunt has also tweeted.Pink News posted this earlier, wishing everyone a happy Pride.And here is a note of caution from the organisers.Isaac, 24, is marching with the Out and Proud Africa LGBTI group for his first ever Pride march. He hadn’t attended the event before because his parents did not know he was gay.“Now I’m out and they know that I am gay,” he says. “And now I don’t fear anybody. I’m proud of myself, I’m proud of who I am.”Campaign group Movement for Justice has criticised the government for preventing the return of an unlawfully deported Ugandan lesbian, after a high court judge ruled that the handling of her case was “procedurally unfair”.Elsewhere, bus advertisements along the Pride route have been replaced with “alternative ads” questioning why the Home Office, the politan police and global corporations are able to participate in this year’s Pride while “marginalised groups are left watching on the sidelines because they are unable to afford spaces on the march”.Sam Bjorn, a spokesperson for Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants, said:You have to ask what London Pride is really for? While the Home Office are celebrated, the LGBT+ migrants that they have dehumanised, detained and forced to live in fear of deportation have to watch from the sidelines.The Foreign Office, meanwhile, has been lauding its credentials, after four LGBT Syrian refugees arrived in the UK on Thursday – where they will be able to openly express their sexual identity when they join the Pride celebrations today.The group arrived in London this week after waiting for more than two years to be airlifted to safety. Their situation was resolved after the  highlighted the plight of 15 LGBT Syrian refugees stranded in Turkey this year. Others in the group were expected to follow soon.Campaigners claimed yesterday that Pride in London has become too regimented and commercialised.Caroline Davies and Henry McDonald report:Peter Tatchell, one of the organisers of the UK’s first Pride parade in 1972, criticised local authority-imposed limits on marcher numbers. “In the 1990s over 100,000 marched, and similar numbers would probably march today if the parade was not restricted,” he said. “Pride has become so bureaucratic and regimented.

I stand at the crossroads of a barrage of intersections and can feel fragmented at times. I am constantly defined as not white, not straight, not something, instead of being defined by what I am. I now understand pride as a celebration of otherness. To be proud of being queer is to be proud of shattering expectations and norms, and embracing whatever expression, whatever love, we need in order to feel whole.Writer Otamere Guobadia said when questioned about his hopes for the future:That queerness does away with our binaries, our bizarre fixation on fixedness. My hope for the future is that it is truly, unabashedly queer. Queerness is evidence of more. It is a peek into the cauldron at the beginning of the universe. Evidence that we, in acting purportedly ‘against nature’, might ourselves expand it. It is evidence of the ine. Queerness is water from the stone, Lazarus from the depths, something from nothing.Organisers announced yesterday that they had declared a climate emergency in response to demands made by Extinction Rebellion, and said they aim to make the event carbon neutral by next year. This morning, XR LGBTIQ welcomed Pride in London’s commitment, after they presented their demands in person two days ago. In recognising the problematic nature of the ecocidal profiteering of some of the groups in the parade they have acknowledged the basis of a third demand and we welcome their intention to address this between now and next year’s event in London.We are in awe of the actions of rebels in London, across the UK, and internationally whose commitment to the rebellion has brought about this extraordinary statement. We are aware that we are a self-selecting group and that we cannot speak for anybody except ourselves. Some people will be disappointed that companies like BP and Exxon Mobile will be represented and heavily branded in the parade this year. Iniduals and groups both within XR LGBTIQ and outside within the wider movement will make their own decisions on how to respond to that fact.We ask all rebels whether queer or not to treat everybody today with the respect that lies at the heart of the Extinction Rebellion message.Pride in London said in a statement on Friday: Having met with Extinction Rebellion LGBTIQ we are aligned on the fact that everyone needs to respond to the ecological crisis, and that minority causes are likely to be impacted most by planetary breakdown.For this reason, we are joining them in declaring a climate emergency and will be taking steps to review our impact to make Pride in London carbon neutral by 2020. We acknowledge the problematic nature of the ecocidal profiteering of some of the groups in the parade and will consider our next steps on this carefully, in consultation with our Community Advisory Board (who are currently recruiting an Environment \u0026amp Sustainability Representative), to hold businesses accountable to not just their support for the LGBTQI+ community when they take part in Pride, but also their impact on the planet year-round.The parade has been free from plastic glitter since 2017 and other environmentally friendly measures include volunteers being given a refillable bottle on the day. It also does not allow diesel powered ice cream vans into any of its areas.NHS staff will show their support for Pride by wearing a rainbow badge in a bid to break down barriers LGBT+ people can face when accessing healthcare.This is from the Press Association.The badges are “simple visible symbols of support” for people who may come across negative attitudes towards the LGBT+ community, the consultant behind the scheme said. Dr Michael Farquhar, who works at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital, pioneered the initiative as part of a wider commitment to address LGBT+ healthcare challenges. As many as 150,000 doctors, nurses, cleaners, surgeons, midwives and other health service staff across around one in three of England’s acute trusts have opted to wear the badge, which shows the NHS logo superimposed on the rainbow pride flag. NHS England said the scheme is aimed at helping patients identify staff they can talk to about health and wellbeing issues relating to gender and sexuality and showing that those staff will signpost them to resources to explain LGBT+ health issues. It is also an attempt to break down barriers LGBT+ people sometimes face in healthcare, including getting regular cancer screening. NHS England said that as well as the Rainbow Badge initiative, other NHS England trusts across the country are introducing schemes to focus on inclusion of the LGBT+ community. Dr Farquhar said: “We developed the Rainbow NHS badge model at Evelina London Children’s Hospital to signal to LGBT+ people using our services that those wearing the badge are good people to talk to about these issues, but also to help challenge some of the negative attitudes towards LGBT+ people which research has shown sadly still persist across the NHS. “More personally, I know how much seeing simple visible symbols of support would have meant to me as a gay teenager.” Dr Michael Brady, the new NHS national LGBT health adviser, said: “Every single part of our NHS should be a place where LGBT+ people are accepted and respected. “The Rainbow Badge scheme is a brilliant push by hard-working NHS staff, as part of our Long Term Plan for the health service, to show how much the LGBT+ community - patients and staff - is valued.” NHS staff are among those taking part in the annual Pride in London parade today.Welcome to the ’s live coverage of today’s Pride events in London.It comes 50 years after the Stonewall uprising in New York – a moment which changed the face of the gay rights movement around the world. Parade groups will honour five decades of activism, protests and victories, and those behind this year’s march have said it is an opportunity for people to stand up against bigotry and hatred in all its forms. Alison Camps, co-chairman of Pride in London, said:As we take to the streets of London once again, it’s vital that we remember that Pride is not just one day a year - we must fight for the rights of all members of our community all year round. In this momentous anniversary year, we must all take stock of how far we’ve come, and of the contributions and sacrifices made by trans women of colour to get us to where we are today.Our main aim is to ensure that everyone who comes to Pride in London has a safe space to celebrate, protest or mark the occasion however they wish. We will not allow Pride to be used as a platform for hate and we encourage everyone to come out and join us today so we can stand together against bigotry and hatred in all its forms. There will be a new World Area at Golden Square in Soho, in an effort to increase the visibility of black, Asian and minority ethnic LGBT+ people.

Mr Isaac was speaking at the launch of a report by the think-tank Theos about faith on campus.“We are living in an age of hypersensitivity where it is increasingly easier for people to feel offended - or others to be worried about protecting minority groups,” he said.  Last year, a pro-life student group was refused permission to set up stalls at three different university freshers’ fairs.The charity, called Life, wrote to the independent regulator of higher education in England to express concern about discriminatory behaviour and freedom of expression violations… by a number of university student unions. In 2017, an Oxford College banned the Christian Union from its freshers’ fair on the grounds that it would be “alienating” for students of other religions, and constitute a “micro-aggression”.The organiser of Balliol’s fair argued Christianity’s historic use as “an excuse for homophobia and certain forms of neo-colonialism” meant that students might feel “unwelcome” in their new college if the Christian Union had a stall.At the time,  the vice-president of Balliol’s Junior Common Room (JCR) committee, said that if a representative from the Christian Union attended the fair, it could cause potential harm to freshers.  Baby Archie Harrison\u0026#39s christening: latest news as Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive at Windsor CastleTribute or prank?

But it appears that geeks have become the new jocks, as British universities now have more competitive gaming teams than any other sport.For the first time there are more students taking part in “e-sports” than football, according to figures compiled and British Universities and College Sport (BUCS) and  National Student E-sports (NSE).E-sports have now overtaken football as the sport with the highest number of teams at British universities. There are 685 e-sports teams spread across 73 universities in the UK, compared to 662 football teams.The next most popular sport is hockey with 546 teams, followed by netball with 432 teams and then Rugby Union with 425 teams.Jon Tilbury, director at NSE which organises inter-university gaming tournaments, said that while university gaming societies have been around for 15 to 20 years, it is only in the past five years or so that they rapidly increased in popularity.Some societies now have hundreds of members, he said, and certain universities have separate societies for particular games.For the first time there are more students taking part in “e-sports” than footballMr Tilbury said that the surge in interest from university students echoes the growth in the gaming industry more generally. “Interest in e-sports has been there for a long time,” Mr Tilbury said. “The wider e-sports community has grown massively, with professional teams paid big salaries and flown around the world to be in tournaments . “What we see is a lot of university students with technical skills getting involved, we have students who have developed their own custom software.”Some universities, which have a particular enthusiasm for gaming, have different societies for particular types of games, for example, Warwick University has a Nintendo Society as well as an E-sports Society. The average university e-sports team consists of 6.5 players, according to data from NSE. Around 90 per cent of players are male, 70 per cent of them are studying courses in STEM subjects.Mr Tilbury explained that inter-university games can be played by students from the comfort of their own bedrooms, but players would meet up in person for the final of a tournament.The NSE co-ordinates with BUCS, the umbrella organisation that organises sports matches, to ensure that gaming matches to do deter students from playing other sports, he added.   The most popular reason students cited for competing in gaming championships was making and maintaining friendships, and improving and becoming a better player, according to a survey by the NSE.Baby Archie Harrison\u0026#39s christening: latest news as Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive at Windsor CastleTribute or prank?

There is absolutely a perception among students, echoed by teachers, that getting top grades in languages is difficult and is more difficult than other subjects.”Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, says the status quo is \u0026#34unacceptable\u0026#34He said this is not an unreasonable calculation to make, adding that parents also advise their children against languages on this basis. They are making the same sort of calculation: What is going to enable my child to as successful as possible?What will be the best passport to the next stage?Entries for GCSEs in both French and German have dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent, according to figures compiled by the British Council for its annual language trends report. The report, published earlier this week, showed that in 2014, there were 166,167 entries for French GCSE and 60,362 for German but by 2018, this had dropped to 117,046 and 42,296 respectively.Mr Buchanan said that the status quo is “unacceptable”, adding: “Whether its Ofqual or someone else - unless we do something, languages will die. There won’t be students who want to take them, and over time there won’t be enough teachers to teach them”.This summer is the second year that students have taken revamped GCSE exams in modern foreign languages (MFL).The new courses were part of a package of reforms by Michael Gove, the former education secretary, designed to toughen up syllabuses, make courses more linear, and cut down on the number of students getting A*s.Ofqual, the exam regulator, is currently undertaking a review of the reformed GCSE MFL subjects, which is due to conclude this autumn.It said it is “aware of statistical evidence” that suggests that GCSE MFL subjects may be “more severely graded than many others”.However, the watchdog said that this alone is not necessarily enough to “justify a change to grading standards”.An Ofqual spokesperson said that their research so far suggests that the new GCSEs are “functioning well”, but added that it takes concerns about the perceived difficulty of MFL subjects “seriously” and it “continues to look at this issue in detail”.They added: “We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of grading standards in GCSE French, German and Spanish, looking at statistical evidence, contextual data including trends in the numbers taking these subjects and the quality of students’ work, to see if there is compelling case for an adjustment to grading standards in these subjects.”Baby Archie Harrison\u0026#39s christening: latest news as Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive at Windsor CastleTribute or prank?

The ship is just drifting because it’s early for its next port. It hasn’t issued any distress signals or shown any problems on board,” the sources said.A ship tracking website showed the Pacific Voyager coming to a halt off the coast of IranThe United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which coordinates shipping in the Gulf, said later that the ship was safe and well. The UKMTO, had been in direct contact with the vessel, anofficial said.Iran dismissed as fabricated reports that the ship had been seized by its Revolutionary Guard forces. IRIB quoted unnamed senior Iranian government sources denying the boat had been seized.Earlier in the week, Royal Marines helped customs officers impound the tanker near Gibraltar, believed to be carrying two million barrels of Iranian crude to Syria in violation of EU sanctions, sparking a diplomatic spat.The move provoked fury in Iran, which accused Britain of bowing to US pressure to blockade its oil exports, even summoning the British ambassador to the foreign ministry in Tehran to express “its very strong objection to the illegal and unacceptable seizure” of the 300-meter vessel.Gibraltar officials however said that it had acted independently and denied seizing the tanker at the request of the US or any other country.“If Britain does not release the Iranian oil tanker, it is the authorities’ duty to seize a British oil tanker,” said Mohsen Rezai, a Major General in the Revolutionary Guards Corps and head of the country’s influential Expediency Council, which advises the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.“Islamic Iran in its 40-year history has never initiated hostilities in any battles, but has also never hesitated in responding to bullies,” he added.The Pacific Voyager, passed through the strait of Hormuz en route to the Saudi port of Ras Tanura on Friday. It is Japanese-owned, operated by a Singaporean company, and hired by a subsidiary of a South Korean firm. Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, on Thursday announced it would levy a war risk surcharge on cargos transiting the Persian Gulf.The US and Britain have blamed Iran for a series of sabotage attacks against tankers near the Strait of Hormuz in May and June.Ministry of DefenceBaby Archie Harrison\u0026#39s christening: latest news as Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive at Windsor CastleTribute or prank?

That is why Britain is leaving,” she told MEPs in her maiden speech in Strasbourg on Thursday. “It doesn’t matter which language you use, we are going, and we are glad to be going.”Ms Widdecombe, who represents South West England, said it was “a great honour to speak on behalf of the largest single party” in the European parliament – a reference to the Brexit Party’s victory at the EU elections.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit Party: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyNigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyMPs and other MEPs criticised the Brexiteer’s comments. Labour MP David Lammy said: “It is impossible to explain how offensive and ahistorical it is for you to equate my ancestors tearing off their chains with your small-minded nationalist project. Shame on you.”Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said: “Nigel Farage is facing some stiff competition as chief clown of the Brexit Party in the European parliament. By the way, when Widdecombe talks about ‘colonies liberating themselves from their empires’, is she really referring to the American Revolution of 1776?”Johnson boosts fundraising lead with £235,000 from Brexit backersEmmanuel Macron says EU should not be scared of no-deal BrexitGreen MEP Alexandra Phillips said: “Is she drunk? This is beyond embarrassing. It’s this type of behaviour which makes me ashamed to be a British MEP right now.”Martin Horwood, a Liberal Democrat, suggested the former Tory MP had a waning grip on reality and had embarrassed Britain. “To imply that the United Kingdom is any way in a similar situation to the colonies of our former empire or a victim of slavery is deeply offensive. Widdecombe’s comments trivialise the suffering of those who have experienced slavery and colonialism,” he told The Independent after the speech.“If Ann Widdecombe had any grip on reality, she would have the sense to look at her own record on oppressing women and minorities when she defended shackling pregnant women and opposed repealing Section 28. Anne Widdecombe has not only embarrassed herself but she has embarrassed the nation she represents. I hope she withdraws her comments and sincerely apologises to all those she has offended immediately.”Brexit Party MEPs caused a storm earlier this week when they turned their backs on the EU anthem in protest during the parliament’s opening ceremony.Responding to Ms Widdecombe’s comments, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: “I haven’t spoken to the prime minister about it, but I think it is safe to say that that isn’t a characterisation that she would recognise. Nor is it a phrase she would ever use to describe leaving the EU.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is why Britain is leaving,” she told MEPs in her maiden speech in Strasbourg on Thursday. “It doesn’t matter which language you use, we are going, and we are glad to be going.”Ms Widdecombe, who represents South West England, said it was “a great honour to speak on behalf of the largest single party” in the European parliament – a reference to the Brexit Party’s victory at the EU elections.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit Party: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyNigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyMPs and other MEPs criticised the Brexiteer’s comments. Labour MP David Lammy said: “It is impossible to explain how offensive and ahistorical it is for you to equate my ancestors tearing off their chains with your small-minded nationalist project. Shame on you.”Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said: “Nigel Farage is facing some stiff competition as chief clown of the Brexit Party in the European parliament. By the way, when Widdecombe talks about ‘colonies liberating themselves from their empires’, is she really referring to the American Revolution of 1776?”Johnson boosts fundraising lead with £235,000 from Brexit backersEmmanuel Macron says EU should not be scared of no-deal BrexitGreen MEP Alexandra Phillips said: “Is she drunk? This is beyond embarrassing. It’s this type of behaviour which makes me ashamed to be a British MEP right now.”Martin Horwood, a Liberal Democrat, suggested the former Tory MP had a waning grip on reality and had embarrassed Britain. “To imply that the United Kingdom is any way in a similar situation to the colonies of our former empire or a victim of slavery is deeply offensive. Widdecombe’s comments trivialise the suffering of those who have experienced slavery and colonialism,” he told The Independent after the speech.“If Ann Widdecombe had any grip on reality, she would have the sense to look at her own record on oppressing women and minorities when she defended shackling pregnant women and opposed repealing Section 28. Anne Widdecombe has not only embarrassed herself but she has embarrassed the nation she represents. I hope she withdraws her comments and sincerely apologises to all those she has offended immediately.”Brexit Party MEPs caused a storm earlier this week when they turned their backs on the EU anthem in protest during the parliament’s opening ceremony.Responding to Ms Widdecombe’s comments, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: “I haven’t spoken to the prime minister about it, but I think it is safe to say that that isn’t a characterisation that she would recognise. Nor is it a phrase she would ever use to describe leaving the EU.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Blame it on the fact I’ve just spent the last hour on a bloody exercise bike, trying to shed the burgeoning pounds around my gut.But it’s true, nonetheless — or partly true, at least. One third of Britons are obese. You may have noticed them waddling up the high street, gasping with exertion, curtains of lard hanging down from their arms.Worse still, obesity is now officially a bigger killer than smoking. Being overweight is now the chief cause of four really horrible cancers — oian, bowel, liver and kidney. The full English.We’ve known about this obesity epidemic for a long time now. But we’ve gone about dealing with it in entirely the wrong way.First, the ious charities have told us it’s terribly wrong to fat shame people. It might hurt their self-esteem. Well, good.Shaming works. It was when my son called me a “lard-faced tw*t” during an argument that I decided I needed to do some serious weight-loss stuff. Hence the exercise bike.But we’ve also concentrated — quite wrongly — on diet. And when we do that we end up penalising the very poorest in society. Every week there are calls to raise the price of cheap alcohol, sugary drinks, fast food, any stuff with sugar in it. This is called a “sin tax” and it always hurts the working class. They won’t be putting a tax on Chablis, will they Boris Johnson has just announced that he wants to do away with these sin taxes. It’s the first thing he’s said in ages that I agree with.Start with cigarettes, Boris. But also stop persecuting people who occasionally eat a cheeseburger from McDonald’s.That’s not the real cause of obesity. The real cause is lack of exercise. We live increasingly sedentary lives. We don’t walk enough, we don’t play sport. We sit at desks and fester. This is bad enough for the adult population. But it’s even worse for the kids.Our schoolchildren get less exercise than ever before. When they are at school, the PE lessons are fewer than was once the case. And competitiveness is frowned upon by the leftie teachers.Further, over the years, thousands of acres of school playing fields have been sold off for housing developments. So the kids have nowhere to play competitive games, eventhey were allowed to.And out of school, of course, they are not kicking a ball around, or going on walks. They are instead glued to their bloody electronic devices. Sat on their fat ar*es hammering away at some internet game. Living their lives vicariously instead of in the real world.And they are ferried everywhere by their mums and dads — instead of doing what we did as kids and walk everywhere.That’s the problem, almost the only problem. We don’t have worse diets than I had when I was a kid. Crispy pancakes filled with salty gloop and frozen pizzas that tasted like your sofa Today’s diet is no worse than that stuff. And very few of us were fat then.Somehow we need to convince kids that it’s important to get out and exercise a bit. And parents need to let their kids off the leash a little more. Get them to walk to places.Take their devices off them and kick them out of the house. Impress upon them that legs are useful things and might be funthey employed them once in a while.And for the rest of us: Walk, run, cycle. , paces per day minimum, or you’ll end up like Jabba The Hutt. And then drop dead at .APRIL HAWES was caught on CCTV flinging a cat across a road and at a front door. Twice!She got a community service order and had to pay an £ fine.OK, so you probably shouldn’t throw cats around. It’s a bit cruel and it can make a messyou throw them really hard. But the cat kept venturing into her garden. And probably doing theThe cat’s owner, Kevin Yarham, said: “Shadow was scenting near her house. Cats do what they do, they are animals that explore and they’re free- roaming.”Free-roaming, huh  Zatta fact  Well, me too, actually, Kev. I’m free- roaming. And I’m going to swing by and take a dump in your garden and decapitate a thrush.There are few more selfish people than cat owners. If you can’t keep your cat confined on your own property, don’t have a cat.And isn’t it about time we started fining cat owners when they fail to pick up after their pet has defecated AS you probably gathered, I don’t have too much time for Jeremy Corbyn.He’s a dimbo who buys all the adolescent, far-left stupidity. Policies which were dated decades ago.But I am totally on his side when it comes to his battle with the civil service. Someone within that smug organisation leaked an official “worry” that Corbyn was “too frail” to carry outThat was cruel, spiteful and politically motivated.The civil service is against Corbyn because they don’t agree with his policies. Well, me neither. But the civil service is there to carry out the bidding of WHOEVER we elect, even Magic Grandpa.The problem is that the civil service is heavily biased, just like the BBC. Not so much to the left as towards the liberal viewpoint on all things.We saw this during the Brexit negotiations, when one civil servant broke cover and told The Sunday Times that the entire civil service was against Brexit and did its best to undermine it.We need a clear out of these time servers, cocooned in their middle-class bubble.HERE’S Alex Morgan, scorer of the goal which knocked our Lionesses out of the World Cup.She annoyed people by miming the act of drinking tea. Because that’s what Brits do, of course.When the much better Ellen White scored for England she should have mimed shooting people in a school.Anyway Morgan, we now all hope you get stuffed in the final.ANOTHER startling revelation about our next Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.Apparently he had a row with a woman  years ago. He got quite cross and shouted stuff. So that’s TWO arguments with women in  years.I have two arguments with women every bloody day that God sends. I think there must be something wrong with Boris that he gets on with them so well.The next revelation from Boris’s nosy neighbours or ex-girlfriends  “Boris Johnson sings Dire Straits songs while he’s having a shower.”And “Boris would sometimes use the butter kne to spread marmalade on his toast, leaving a small residue of butter in the marmalade jar.”WHO the hell is Jason Mohammad  That’s the question most of the country was asking this week. It was revealed that Jase is paid £, by the BBC. Making him one of their top earners. For what Apparently he reads out the football results in Final Score and does some awful programme on Radio Five.Do you ever get the feeling that the BBC is just a little bit cavalier with your money THE Tavistock Clinic has just released its latest figures. This is the place where medical experiments are carried out on children who wish to transition to a dferent gender.The shocking news is that more  than HALF of these kids are younger  than  .And the youngest was just three years old.We will look back on this in appalled horror, years from now.HERE’S a true story. My missus was in Costa Coffee. Long queue. Customer with green hair and multiple piercings approaches the counter. “I need to see the full list of ingredients for your frappuccinos. I have multiple, serious allergies,” she barks at the barista.He comes back with a big folder. She reads it for five minutes, while the queue gets longer. Eventually, she places her order.The barista goes off to make it. She shouts at him that he can’t use the same equipment that he used to make other drinks. It might be contaminated. Exasperated, the barista says: “Well I’ll have to put it through the dishwasher, then – are you happy to wait ” Queue gets longer.I don’t want to sound callous, buther allergies are that ied and dangerous, shouldn’t she just make herself a drink at home Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I did once come across a good one on  the Channel Island of Sark but that’s about as far afield as the genre works.Spaniards, for a communal knees-up, will hold an evening fiesta with castanet-clacking, flamenco dancers and lots of shouts of: “Ole!”Scandinavians, in their few moments of fervour, will dance around apple trees, drink aquavit and jump into the nearest lake wearing their birthday suits.Germans obey the summons of an oompah band and will sit in orderly rows at long tables to eat cake and take the pils. The French play boules in dusty town squares. Icelandics bubble in boiling mud baths. Swiss yodel. Italians sing. And Russians sunbathe standing up, like armies of penguins.Yet we British attend local fêtes or school fairs, to delight ourselves with cheesy games. Do you like whack-a-mole or are you more of an apple bobber, plunging your head into a barrel of cold water to try to bite an elusive Granny Smith Bouncy castles, face-painting, white-elephant stalls, the suggestive-carrots display, guess-the--of-the-sausage-dog or the dreaded bric-a-brac stall: These are the daft indulgences of the British summer. Sophisticated  No. But that’s the whole point. Fêtes are exuberantly shambolic and unsnobby.You’ll find them in country and urban districts alike, from the Isle of Wight to Inverness. They never wheedle for public money. You won’t ever hear them bragging about their Bame quotas. They just get on with le and are cheerfully self-sufficient and unaffectedly erse.The other weekend a  friend worked the BBQ  at his children’s school in London and reported a joyous snapshot of modern Britain.Lots of women in hijabs played hook-a-duck, spending their cash on halal burgers and cans of pop. It’s not a bad definition of Britishness: Have you ever been to a fête Certain rules apply.RULE ONE: At least one lady on the organising committee shall be called Peggy or Alison.RULE TWO: The trestle tables at the tea stall shall wobble alarmingly, but never quite collapse.RULE THREE: The home-made chocolate eclairs shall start to melt in the cakes tent.RULE FOUR: The PA system operated by the master of ceremoniesshall be prey to random bursts of deafening feedback.RULE FIVE: Evenit rains, everyone will totter home happy.Foreigners often find us hard to understand. At present they are baffled that our Government may soon be led by crumpled, grunting Boris Johnson, and that his opponent will be rambling revolutionary Jeremy Corbyn, an OAP who likes shell-suits and municipal manhole covers.Global diplomats and analysts pore over the socio-economic data, the pollsters’ pie charts, the tax statistics and more, and they puzzle.Likewise, they behold the weekly argy-bargy of Prime Minister’s Questions, or the sight of Nigel Farage and his merry MEPs turning their backs on the EU anthem at the opening of the European Parliament, and they are flummoxed. Brexit bamboozles them — “But why do you wish to leave our European Union ” They really don’t get it.My advice to our foreign friends is this: Follow the bunting and get yourself to a neighbourhood summer beano.Visit a fête and you will soon understand the British character. Bloody-minded,  quirky, unassuming, unfazed about politically-correct crazes.Fêtes are a telling combination of romantic tradition and anarchy. No one wants them to be slickly modern.We want our fêtes to be small-c conservative: The canvas marquee to smell as it did  years ago, the skittles lane to be surrounded by no more health and safety paraphernalia than a few straw bales, and at least one of the domestic-produce judges to become squfy after sampling the home-made sloe gins.At our village in Herefordshire it is always my job to supervise the dog show. In the parade ring things iniably unravel. We have had fights and attempted matings .One year a lad aged  about six entered the ring with a Great Dane twice his size. The dog, naturally, was called Tiny.Another year, in the musical mats competition, a great-gran in her s was so determined to win that she used her walking stick to trip up a teenage rival. We Brits may have an amateurish bent but we are competitive, too. The EU should not overlook that truth.Politicians and quangocrats and the BBC are convinced that the country is in decline and that everyone has some problem or is oppressed by an -ism.A trip to a fête would put them right. Fêtes are optimistic, classless, unpretentious, fun. No race quotas. No safety announcements. No risk assessments. No race or gender angst.They may often look like something from a Richard Curtis film but fêtes are a better reflection of st-century Britain than any state-subsidised art show or any right-on TV soap.See you at the tombola stand. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She has been released on bail until July .Witnesses earlier revealed how they were in fear for their lives after their fellow passenger went for the exit door as they flew to Dalaman in Turkey on June .Amy Varol, who sat two rows behind, told The Sun Online: The woman was walking down the aisle when she literally ran to the exit door.She had her hands on the handle trying to open it.Luckily there were two cabin crew there who pulled her off the door.Ms Varol continued: She started assaulting the two crew members, a woman and a man.A big guy then literally threw her down to the floor and there was one person holding one arm and another person holding the other.Then a man sat on her and one person was holding her leg and someone  holding the other one.Thats when she started screaming get off me, Im going to kill everyone.And a former bouncer revealed how he tackled the woman to the ground during the hijack alert.Steven Brown, , said: She was punching, kicking and screaming at the stewards, they were trying to stop her but they had no chance.She was only petite but she had the strength of a fully-grown man. The only time Ive seen anything like that was when someone had just dropped acid, she had super strength.It was like she was possessed.In a statement, a Jet spokesperson said: We are now liaising with the relevant authorities to support their investigation, and we will not hesitate to prosecute.For years we have been highlighting just how serious the consequences of disruptive passenger behaviour can be. These consequences include huge fines, letime bans and court action. They now also include the authorities having to scramble fighter jets to escort commercial aircraft, proof that this behaviour must stop now.Describing the passengers behaviour as extremely disruptive, they thanked crew and passengers for assisting on the flight.Many people living near Stansted phoned police to report a loud noise they thought could be an explosion when the RAF Typhoons were scrambled to the flight.A sonic boom is created when supersonic aircraft accelerate through the sound barrier - which is banned over land except in emergencies.Cops confirmed Chloe was not detained under the mental health act.Essex Police confirmed at the time of the incident: A woman arrested at Stansted Airport over the weekend has since been released on bail.The -year-old, from Maidenhead in Berkshire, was arrested on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and endangering an aircraft.She has been released on bail until Tuesday  July.Jet have been approached by the Sun Online for further comment, and Costa declined to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now victims will continue to receive support as long as they need it.Jurors heard the accounts of more than  victims, but it is believed at least  more had been through the gangs hands, who had since either ed to their homeland, could not be traced, or were too scared to come forward.Victims would in some cases be frog-marched to cash points, to withdraw money and told they owed debts for transport costs, rent and food.The gang operation was smashed after victims were uncovered by anti-slavery charity Hope for Justice.The charity said  of the victims eventually made contact through its painstaking outreach efforts at two drop-in centres.The organisation was then able to flag the slavery rings existence to police.West Midlands Police then launched an investigation in February .At the end of the second case last month, a jury at Birmingham Crown Court convicted two men, -year-old Ignacy Brzezinski, from West Bromwich, and Wojciech Nowakowski, , of James Turner Street, Birmingham, of modern slavery offences.A third, Jan Sadowski, , from West Bromwich, admitted his part on the first day of trial.At a previous trial ending in February, leading conspirator Marek Chowanic, along with Ignacys cousin, Marek Brzezinski, recruitment consultant Julianna Chodakiewicz, Natalia Zmuda and Justyna Parczewska, the groups matriarch, were all convicted of their roles.Want to help  Here are some of the possible warning signs to look for, according to the Modern Slavery Helpline:Suspicious  You can call the Modern Slavery Helpline on   , or fill in an online report at: www.modernslaveryhelpline.org report"},{"url":null,"title":"princess diana meghan markle hide archie","story":"He told us so this week at the Diana Awards, set up in her honour, on what would have been her th birthday.Diana was the empty chair at Harry’s wedding, and would have been the first one at Meghan’s bedside to smother her fourth grandchild in kisses and cuddles.She would have been so excited today, getting ready for Archie’s christening and, I believe, would have had a quiet but firm word with Harry and Meghan in the run-up to this special day.I totally understand that they want the actual ceremony to be a private affair and to have those precious moments with their little baby boy and close friends only.But they are also members of the Royal Family and everybody wants to see TV footage and photos of the occasion.They have spent an absolute fortune on doing up Frogmore Cottage and will continue to lavish public money on their home to make it perfect and secure.I reckon they were both taken by surprise by the backlash about the refurbishment. Perhaps they feel aggrieved by the bad publicity and have decided to pull up the drawbridge to keep us all out today.It doesn’t work like that.Diana, who knew all about public perception and how to deal with the media, would have advised them to counteract the criticism by making sure that Archie’s christening was an event the whole country could enjoy.There would have been no question of the names of godparents being kept secret, or photos of such a big occasion only being released on Harry and Meghan’s carefully controlled Instagram account.Diana would have known that images of a cute baby and his doting parents, with guests all done up to the nines, would take the heat off the negative stories surrounding the Frogmore building work.I’m sure Meghan has been bruised by some of the, frankly, racist and utterly vile comments on social media, as well as the upsetting and ongoing feud with her family — apart from her mum, Doria.Not even Diana would have been able to silence those hideous trolls, but her wise counsel would have stopped the Markle clan from being a thorn in Meghan’s side.Even before the engagement announcement, Diana would have flown over to the USA and entranced Thomas Markle.I have no doubt Diana would have given him a masterclass in dealing with the media.There would have been no clumsy staged paparazzi shots and Thomas Markle would have proudly walked his daughter down the aisle.Diana, would have been on hand with advice about the announcement of baby Archie’s arrival, which was all a bit messy.She would have been a staunch ally to Meghan and helped her navigate the choppy waters of royal protocol, and been a terric sounding board for any worries the new mum might encounter.Diana would have been a cheerleader for Harry and Meghan’s plans to make a dference both here and in Africa and supported their plans to spend half the year in Botswana with baby Archie, albeit with assurances that “Granny Di” could pop over for regular visits.I understand Harry and Meghan want to protect their little boy and allow him to grow up leading as “normal” a le as possible, but they really can’t have it both ways.Either they are private citizens and pay for their own loft extension, or they are royals and have to share the big events in their lives with the rest of the world. Diana would have helped them achieve that balance.It’s a crying shame she isn’t here, but I truly hope Harry and Meghan have a joyful time today and maybe even change their minds and give us all a peek at the celebrations.FIFTY years ago, Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon and the world was in awe.As a ten-year-old watching this “giant leap for mankind” I genuinely believed that we had taken the first small step into the unknown and were boldly going “where no one had gone before”.I did a primary school project on the first manned voyage to Mars, which we reckoned would take place in  –  nothing seemed impossible.In the years before the Moon landing, we watched Star Trek and thought we’d be living that TV series for real.There was to have been a lunar base, and from there we would explore the solar system and eventually the rest of the universe.Of course none of this came to pass, except in our imaginations and sci-fi films.Scientists had the curiosity and the imagination but, sadly, the general public lost interest.After the space shuttle disasters in  and  that killed  crew members, politicians got cold feet and the manned missions were shelved.This loss of le was tragic but, ever since we started exploring space, astronauts have always paid the ultimate price.Even the Apollo  Moon landing came close to disaster.This week sees the release of Armstrong, an astonishing documentary about the first man on the Moon.Watching the footage, you will gain a new-found respect for this rare breed of human beings.Hopefully it will ignite a new passion among this current generation to once again travel into space.If we don’t seek out “new le and new civilisations”, then what are we actually here for THE biggest kid of all in the le of Coleen Rooney would appear to be her husband.She’s ed home with her four boys and left Wayne in the US with a list of strict instructions most mums would leave for their stroppy teenage sons.Wayne has been warned that there is to be no boozing, no wild parties and he has to phone Coleen every day to check in with her so she can be reassured he really is behaving himself.No wonder the poor lass has to have so many holidays.Looking after FIVE boisterous boys must be utterly exhausting.I AM more than a little bit in love with Suranne Jones as “Gentleman Jack”.This cracking drama based on the real-le th century lesbian Anne Lister is witty, wicked and, at times, impossibly sad.Anne was a bold pioneer trying to find her place in le.At a time when women were kept firmly in their place and either treated like imbeciles or fragile pieces of bone china, she was a sharp businesswoman who owned her own land and took no s**t.When it came to matters of the heart, however, Anne was achingly vulnerable and badly let down by the women she loved.It’s the last episode tomorrow but,you have missed out, you can catch up on BBC iPlayer and a second series has already been commissioned.CAROL Vorderman has the sort of figure that would make Jessica Rabbit turn pea green with envy – proper gorgeous, voluptuous curves.She told me it’s all down to doing thousands of squats, walking for miles in the countryside and the side-effects of the menopause.Under that regime, most of us would end up with rock-hard flat buttocks, sore feet and horric night sweats.GAIL Porter famously once had her derrière beamed on to the Houses of Parliament.It actually made a refreshing change to see a backside on the outside of the building, instead of the usual arses who inhabit the interior.Back then, Gail was at the height of her fame as a TV presenter and lads’ mag favourite.It looked as though she was living the dream, but the poor girl was suffering horribly inside.She’s had well documented mental health issues including being diagnosed as bipolar, and suffering with anorexia and anxiety.At one point, in deep despair, she even tried to take her own le.Possibly due to all the stress, Gail’s hair fell out and never grew back.It’s not been an easy road, but I am delighted this irrepressible and beautul woman has bounced back.She’s now in a good place and keen to help others who have been through similar experiences.Gail has teamed up with The Samaritans, an organisation that has helped her in the past, to ask us all to take part in a marathon.The good news is you can take the whole of July to reach  miles.That’s under a mile a day and you can run, jog or walk.Build up your miles in your nearest park, going to work on foot or just out for a stroll.For more information on the Samarathon, see Samaritans.org. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That Brexit is hard, that we do not know how to genetically-engineer unicorns, that a few weeks of summer is not long enough to renegotiate a thing it took us  years to come up with.But the main reason the next PM will not meet the deadline is because the European Commission with which they have both pledged to talk will not start work until November .Parlez-vous avec vous-mêmes, mes Jambon Fumés. Itaposs vote of no confidence time for you, with a majority of  and a party thataposs just realised itaposs picked yet another plonker.  Boris Johnson would demand a No Deal Brexit, and lose a third of his Parliamentary party. Jeremy Hunt,he were PM, would demand another extension and lose a dferent third. Neither would be able to form a ing government in the  days after losing a vote of no confidence, and so off to the country theyaposd be forced to go.The outcome of a general election in such times is hard to predict. But we do know the party leaders, and the likely leaders, and can predict what theyaposll do. Johnson would form an open coalition of some sort with the Brexit Party in the hope of soaking up enough Bugger It All To Hell votes to leave without a deal. To get it, heaposd need to offer Nigel Faragesomething. Perhaps readmittance to the Conservative Party, a safe seat, or an agreement to stand aside in Leave areas and let the Batsh****rs have a clear run. Itaposs been suggested he might offer a peerage, infor the insurgent party being mothballed in the way that all limited companies can be. Pictureyou will Lord Whiny of Garage, failed public school boy, failed husband, and  times a failed MP, clad in ermine and finally gted a right to rule over us.And in the House of Lords, whereaposd he be about as welcome as a pimple on a porn staraposs bum.   Hunt would be more likely to plump for reason over populism, and fight for a sane and steady Brexit that has as much hope of winning as a one-legged donkey. Whichever of them is PM, and whatever strategy they choose to fight a general election, neither Hunt or Johnson can win.Even - and this is the important bit to remember - even WITH the help of a hugely-popular Brexit Party. General elections arenapost like locals, when no-one cares. Theyaposre not like the Euros, with a system that allows unelectable people to be put on a list and pretend a popularity theyaposd never otherwise have. A general election demands not only a majority to win, but for that popularity to be repeated in a minimum of  constituencies nationwide. Andeveryonecares about them. Remainers, Leavers, atheists, Communists, Muslims, EU citizens: everyone. Theyaposll care about it even more after  years of government by goons, followed by a PM they didnapost get to pick and who turned out to be more of the same.  General elections require groundwork. Labour won in Peterborough and Newport, despite having the least popular leader in history, because they had activists knocking on doors, talking about local issues and presenting a human face to recall when the voter saw names on a piece of paper. Despite losing an estimated , members in the past year, it still has a massive network of people to call on, many of them young and enthusiastic.The Conservative Party has , members, the vast majority of whom are white males with an average age in their middle s. They too have a committed machine that can organise, although nowhere near as vast. While both main parties have problems convincing donors to part with their money at the moment, they will cough upa change of government is threatened. The Lib Dems have more than , members, including a whole bunch of new councillors. The Greens have around ,, with a recent boost from the climate change protests, and disaffected Corbynistas.The Brexit Party has  shareholders. They can throw a rave, but they wonapost get people to knock many doors. Supporters will argue they didnapost need activists to win the Euros. But there they won with limited support in massive constituencies, and still took less than half the seats available:  out of a potential . They have one local councillor,  Welsh assembly members, and zero membership rights.They have , registered supporters. But as has been exhaustively pointed out, their funding sources are questionable, which means the identitiesof these alleged people is entirely unknown. Itaposs not built for democracy, but demagoguery.Farage has no troops for a battle. He has no hardware. He has computer data, social media profiles and the like, and many believe that is enough to sway a signicant chunk of the electorate. But last time I checked, Facebook thought I was a man who likes soft jazz, so donapost bank on its brilliance.Farage, like Vladimir Putin who he so admires, can talk a good war. He can rile the easily-fooled, and get people to put their hands in their pockets. But in the same way he has never been photographed buying somebody  a pint, he has never in  years been able to persuade a majority of voters, plus one, to back him. UKIP once commanded m votes in the United Kingdom. But they were so dispersed across the country there was not enough in one place to generate a single Parliamentary seat. When that party ed one solitary MP in , it was with a majority that had plummeted from , to ,. UKIP made turncoat Douglas Carswell less popular, not more so.  And remember - this was when Brexit still looked possible, even positive. Today one of the Brexit Party candidates admits it will lead to  years of economic stre. Jacob Rees-Mogg reckons itaposs nearer , and both prospective PMs say it will cost billions in subsidies to save just some of the businesses likely to go bust.Brexit seems beyond the reach of the self-cannibalising Tories, while Labouraposs destructive ambiguity has killed its chances of government stone-dead. Neither Red or Blue has a cat in hellaposs chance of forming a government alone.There is a slim chance that, under Johnson, the Tories would strike a deal with Farage and scrape together enough seats to rule with the help of the DUP and the absentee Sinn Fein. But they would be even less likely to agree a fresh deal with the EU, or survive another vote of no confidencethey attempted to leave without one. The Lib Dems and Greens will do well in the impending election butthey co-operated with each other, they could sweep the board in the south, west, and London. Elsewhere, the Labour heartlands have abandoned their backing for Brexit as manufacturers have deserted them, and a Labour Party which backed Remain or a second referendum strongly enough could scoop up seats in Wales, the north, and Scotland.Remain or Leave, we all need a ing government. We wonapost get onewe continue with this Brexit madness. The only chance for stability, and sanity - and, entirely coincidentally, for Remaining in the EU - is a Rainbow Coalition of yellow, green and red.Plaid Cymru and the Greens have already agreed to stand aside in the Brecon by-election. Labour refused in Peterborough.

The small, private ceremony at  Windsor Castle is taking place later today and official pictures will be released after pm. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, is conducting the christening in the Private Chapel, and the couple have asked photographer Chris Allerton to take the photos. The godparents, in keeping with their wishes, will remain private, a statement by Buckingham Palace said earlier this week. And despite the couple wanting to keep the ceremony underwraps, the Palace has revealed some of the intimate details, including how water from the River Jordan will be used during the baptism.  Archie will wear the handmade replica of the Royal Christening Robe, created by Angela Kelly, Dressmaker to The Queen, while some members of the St George’s Chapel Choir will be singing at the ceremony. The choir boys performed under director of music James Vivian at the coupleaposs wedding, alongside the Kingdom Choir, whose gospel performance of aposStand by Meapos was an instant hit. The official photographs will be taken in the Green Drawing Room by Allerton, who was one of the coupleaposs wedding photographers. Among the confirmed guests are grandparents Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The Royal Christening Robe Archie will be christened in a historic gown steeped in decades of royal tradition. The Royal Christening Robe, of fine Honiton lace lined with white satin, was made in  for the christening of Queen Victoriaaposs eldest daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal. The original gown was subsequently worn for all Royal christenings, including The Queen, her children and her grandchildren, until the youngest of The Queenaposs eight grandchildren, James, Viscount Severn.  The Queen commissioned Angela Kelly to make a hand-made replica of the Royal Christening Robe in order to preserve the original. James, Viscount Severn, was the first member of the Royal Family to wear this replica gown at his christening at the private chapel at Windsor Castle on th April . Archieaposs cousins - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis - have all worn the replica frilly cream outfit for their christenings, as did Zara and Mike Tindallaposs daughters Mia and Lena.

It was first used at The Princess Royal’s christening in  and has been a feature of Royal christenings since then. Water from the River Jordan will be used during the baptism.    The same water was also used at the christening of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The tradition is nod to the Royal Family’s faith and the river is where Jesus is said to have been baptised by John the Baptist, a preacher who is believed to have worn a cloak of camel hair and lived on locusts and honey. He developed the practice of immersing people in the river to show they had repented of their sins and turned to God for forgiveness. Music Some members of the St George’s Chapel Choir, who performed at Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, will be singing at the ceremony. Conducted by James Vivian, the Choir of St George’s Chapel comprises up to  boy choristers from St George’s School and twelve Lay Clerks singing alto, tenor and bass.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had already refused public access to today’s ceremony and banned television cameras from filming guests arriving. The christening is set to be a private affair and the Queen, Archieaposs great grandmother, will help by keeping the baptism certicate private. And the coupleaposs choice of venue, the Queen’s Private Chapel at Windsor Castle, helps their quest for privacy.     Normally the godparents’ names would be among the christening details recorded in a parish church register that anyone could look at on request. But the tiny venue for Archieaposs ceremony, which is separate from St George’s Chapel where the Duke and Duchess married, is a ‘Royal Peculiar’. Under archaic rules this means godparents will remain anonymous. In the past the Queen has kept baptism certicates for other royals secret, it is understood. However this was never raised as an issue because previously the godparents names were released publically.    A Church of England spokesman confirmed the royals did not adhere to the normal requirements, saying said: “Under the Parochial Registers and Records Measure  all baptisms must be registered and the record made is normally publicly available for searches and for the making of certied copies of entries.  “However the register to be used in this case is held privately by the Royal Household on behalf of the Crown and we understand that it has never complied with the usual requirement.” Among the guests today will be the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Lauren Etchells, , had allegedly been on the run in Europe for almost three years after defying a court order banning her from taking the girl out of Canada, according to police. She allegedly abducted the child, then aged  months, after her relationship with her we, Tasha Brown, broke down. Ms Brown, , hasnapost seen the girl since she was a toddler in September , and she hopes she will soon be reunited with the four-year-old following the arrest of Etchells, say police.  The girl was safe and in good health, said police. The group claimed they had been on holiday in France and decided to pop over to Jersey for a visit. Etchells, a dual British-Canadian citizen who gave birth to the girl, and Ms Brown had used a sperm donor and were raising their daughter on Vancouver Island in the province of British Columbia.   But Etchells, formerly of South Shields, allegedly boarded a flight from Vancouver to London Gatwick Airport in September  with the child and her then-partner, Marco van der Merwe, and their newborn son, CBC News reported. Ms Brown reported the daughter missing, sparking a search across continents as Etchells - wanted on an Interpol red notice - allegedly evaded police in Britain and a number of other countries. The search finally came to an end this week when Etchells and the daughter were found in a dinghy that came ashore on Jersey on Monday, said the Saanich Police Department, based in the Canadian city of Victoria.  They were with her son and Etchellsapos parents Brian and Angela, said police. A police spokesperson said: The group was spotted landing a -foot inflatable dinghy on the shores just south of St Catherineaposs, Jersey, a small island in the English Channel. When questioned as to their plans, they advised they were holidaying in France and decided to pop over to Jersey for a visit.  None of the five passengers had passports and it quickly became apparent to officials that their story did not add up. When the Jersey Police learned of their identities, they believed the group may have been attempting to get to the UK via Jersey in order to avoid passport control on UK soil. Etchells and her parents, both aged , were arrested for offences relating to child neglect and immigration. All three have pleaded guilty to the Jersey charges, and Etchells remains in custody as a result of an arrest warrant for her extradition to Canada, said police.  Police said Etchells had taken her daughter and son from Canada to England, and on to France, the Netherlands and the Middle East, and possibly to Spain and Portugal while on the run. At some point she ended her relationship with van der Merwe and continued to travel with the children using their British passports, it is alleged. In a statement released by police, Ms Brown, who had issued multiple appeals through the media, said: “I am extremely grateful to learn that her daughter is in good health and good care.  I am celebrating today. [My daughter] is alive, and we know where she is! But I can’t celebrate % yet. Not until [my daughter] is back in Canada. It is for this reason that I am spending today with my lawyer, and the ious other agencies involved in bringing [my daughter] home safely and…SOON!! But there is a lot I still need to do. For now, I wish to thank some of the people and agencies that have helped, including: Elisabeth Strain and the Saanich Police Department for their devotion to this case, along with Global Affairs Canada and the Central Authorities in Victoria, BC and London, UK. Today would not be happening without these special people.  I am also grateful for the love I received from the friends and family who kept me going during the lowest of lows. I guess a person can survive on hope. Thank you all for this reminder. She also thanked her supporters in a video posted on YouTube.

However,  per cent of the drivers polled nationwide think councils treat drivers as aposcash cowsapos, and one in four think most fines are issued unfairly. A spokesperson for the Manchester City Council said: Parking and bus lane enforcement is vital to ensure the safe and efficient flow of traffic and keep our city moving, with revenues received from fines reinvested into highways projects. Many parking options are available for motorists across the city, both off and on-street, while anyone who feels that a ticket has been issued in error has the right to appeal against it.    Amanda Stretton, motoring editor at confused said: The fact that almost three quartersof PCN appeals were successful last year suggests that some fines are being issued unfairly. Challenging an unfair fine can be both complicated and daunting. The appeal process is confusing and needs to be made clearer. With councils raking in over £ million in PCNs, it’s only right that some of this fine money is invested to help make road signs clearer to eliminate the number of fines being distributed unfairly.

The auxiliary coastguards with  years experience between them have been dismissed because, technically they had been stood down from the incident by their bosses. The men say they are going to appeal against their dismissals - and a campaign to reinstate them is underway. Restaurant owner Sean Hassall is one of those behind reinstating Ian Pendrick and Richard Clarkson who are part of the Hope Cove coastguard team in south Devon. Sean said: Two weeks ago I had a phone call from Oceans restaurant on Bolberry Down saying that a customeraposs car had slipped down onto the grassy verge near the clf edge. I was confident that the coastguard would be on hand to help the distressed customer. On all occasions, I have found the person in distress does not think rationally and just wants to get their car or pet back safely. This is when things can go wrong and possibly fatal. I understand the coastguard were called but once in attendance were stood down due to it not being deemed as a coastguard job. Two of the team removed their official coastguard attire and in the true spirit of what we do in Devon, removed the vehicle without any risk to le.  He said he would trust the pair aposwith my leapos and the motorist, who was not in the best of health, got his car back safe and sound. But Sean added: As these two kind men who were auxiliary coastguards did notthe coastguard Land Rover back to base before taking the car retrieval on themselves, to personally help the distressed driver out, they were deemed to have acted inappropriately and have been sacked! However, as they are only volunteers, they have had apostheir membership withdrawnapos.

Sean said as the summer season approaches, he fears for a fatal or serious injury incident and that senior coastguard management have made aposa grave errorapos. Ian Pedrick - whose father and grandfather were coastguards before him in a  year family history - said he had been in the job for  years and said: I have been dismissed with immediate effect.  He said they changed out of their coastguard gear and used Richardaposs Land Rover to pull the car to safety - but did not take their coastguard vehicle back to base first. Ian, in his s, said: We were acting off our own backs but because the coastguard vehicle was still here technically we were still on duty they said.

Now with a distinctive blue vaulted ceiling and white walls, the tiny place of worship sits in the inner sanctum of the Queenaposs favourite home. Among its new features are six stained glass windows designed by Archieaposs great-grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh. Philip came up with the inspiration for the windows - which depict a firefighter battling the flames and a workman salvaging a portrait - during the mass restoration of the ancient castle. More than  firefighters from seven counties tackled the inferno.  Staff rushed to remove precious works of art from the Royal Collection from the path of the fire, forming a human chain, helped by the Duke of York, who was in the castle at the time. The fire, which broke out on the Queen and Philipaposs th wedding anniversary on November  , started when a workmanaposs spotlight accidentally set a curtain alight. More than  rooms including nine State Rooms and the vast medieval St Georgeaposs Hall were destroyed.    The gothic chapel, which was added by Queen Victoria, was irreparably damaged. It was formed from a music room for the monarch in the s by the architect Edward Blore, and Victoria regularly worshipped there. Her daughter Princess Helena was married in the tiny chapel and several of her other children were confirmed and christened in the historic setting, which was separated from St Georgeaposs Hall by a beautully carved screen.    It was also where the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Princess Royal were confirmed, and where royals including the Earl of Wessex and Zara Phillips were christened. But following the fire  years ago it was left a blackened shell with the crumbling masonry of partially collapsed walls rising above a pitted stone floor. As part of the £ million restoration project, it was redesigned and relocated from the end of St Georgeaposs Hall to the more practical position within the area of the old Holbein Room.  It has room for only  people, with short rows of red-backed chairs, and is rectangular in shape, rather than the irregular shape of the original. Archie will be christened in the sanctuary, just like the Earl and Countess of Wessexaposs daughter Lady Louise Windsor was in . The chapel was fashioned with a new vestry, arched balconies with choir and organ lofts and carved wooden doors, matching the ceiling decoration.    Its wooden altar was crafted by the Queenaposs nephew, Viscount Linley, now the Earl of Snowdon. The site of the original chapel is now the gothic-style octagonal ante-room which serves as a grand entrance for state dinners. It features an inscribed stone tablet marking the spot where the fire started. The restoration of the Berkshire castle took five years.

Sir Trevor, , added that staff there seemed “genuine in their care and affection” for the animals.But the Mirror can reveal it is the same facility that came under fire after Michael Portillo visited on his BBC Great Indian Railway Journeys show last year.And photos taken months ago, posted on the Facebook page of the Elefantastic sanctuary, show tourists on the backs of elephants as they are washed.   One blogger who visited earlier this year even daubed “I Love NY” on the side of one of the animals in gaudy paint.They said: “While painting the elephant was a ton of fun, taking them for walks, like it’s your own pet, was a once-in-a-letime experience.” Campaigners say there is no “ethical way” to climb on an elephant as they are not designed to carry weight on their backs.ITV said the show made “very clear to the viewer the controversy surrounding the issue of elephants being kept in captivity” and that it “no way condones the riding of these majestic animals”.Sir Trevor accepts in the documentary that letting tourists paint the elephants “has been criticized”. He says elephants have often been “exploited, held captive, abused and used for entertainment”, adding there “is still a long way to go” to protect them.   ITV added: “Programme-makers sought and were given clear assurances that elephant rides were not being conducted at the sanctuary shown, and acted in good faith on the basis of the information received.” A source added: “Whilst at the sanctuary, the team saw no evidence of such activity.”But animal rights campaigners said ITV failed to adequately research the facility before giving it air time.Audrey Gaffney, of the Ethical Bucket List, said: “Sir Trevor has made a genuine attempt to discuss issues concerning captive elephants. He does grasp that they suffer in many of the captive situations. But it is very disappointing to see him visit this facility though which is a very clear case of failure on behalf of the researchers.”   Dr Chris Draper of the Born Free Foundation said: “Elephants do not need to be washed, petted or painted by humans, nor to be managed as part of a tourist attraction. A genuine sanctuary would focus on providing space that permits elephants to be elephants, minimising their contact with people.”BBC’s Paradise Gardens, in which Monty Don rode an elephant, was taken off air last year amid cruelty claims.The Mirror found footage of animals being beaten where Monty’s ride was filmed.And Martin Clunes was\u2028dropped as a patron of Born Free after being filmed on an elephant for another ITV show."},{"url":null,"title":"man spent 20k drastic makeover","story":"NewsMan spends £k on cosmetic surgery as he looked like Alan Carr - but now regrets itLiam Halewood, , says he now regrets altering his face after struggling to get his break in showbizShareCommentsByVickie Scullard:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsLiam Halewood was sick of people making comparisons between himself and Alan Carr\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who spent a whopping £, on cosmetic procedures because aposhe looked too much like Alan Carrapos has now admitted that he regrets it all. Despite initially using his similarities to the -year-old comedian to bag himself a place in the X Factor auditions, Liam Halewood later decided to drastically alter his face, claiming he felt apostrappedapos by the constant comparisons. In just two years, Liam, , transformed his look with botox, fillers in his face and lips, non-surgical jaw alignment and hair transplants, as well as eyebrow shaping, regular facials and skin peels. But despite appearances on reality TV shows including BodyFixers, Four in a Bed and Judge Rinder, Liamaposs showbi career hasnapost reached the heights he was hoping for. Liam, a singer from Blackpool, told the Manchester Evening News : At first, I used looking like Alan Carr to my advantage, but after a while I just wanted to be known for being me.    I decided that Iaposd need to do something drastic to get my big break so I changed my whole look and my face despite my family begging me not to. On the outside people thought I was happy and had loads of money but unfortunately it wasnapost the case. I was in debt, I became depressed, I was going through a orce, I lost everything to chase my dream. People thought I was a star, but in reality, I had nothing. Liam first dipped his toe into the showbiz world in  when he auditioned for the X Factor to try to boost his singing career. But it would be seven years before the former drag queen was finally featured on the show after producers recognised his Alan Carr-esque features from a stint on Eaposs Four in a Bed in .    Liam said: I ended up in a segment on the Xtra Factor with presenters Melvin Odom and Rochelle Humes.I was dressed up as my drag persona and I had to give Melvin advice about how he could dress like one. It gave me a taste of TV and I loved it. But even though the Alan Carr thing got me on there, I felt trapped in that bracket so much that I felt I wasnapost going to make it looking like I did. Liam decided that the only way forward was a drastic make-over and in  he decided to get a new look, with the help of E programme BodyFixers. But that only spurred him on to go for more extreme procedures, and the upkeep of his new appearance proved costly - along with his new glitzy lestyle.    Liam said: It wasnapost just the botox and fillers that cost a lot - I spent thousands on hotels so I could go to all the best parties and mingle with the right people, and didnapost think twice about the £ drinks I was buying everyone. I even spent £ on a pair of Vivienne Westwood jeans which I donapost even have anymore. Looking back, Iaposm shocked at how much I spent. After securing a few spots on TV, including an appearance on Extreme Diet Hotel which saw him lose four stone, it all came to a head for Liam six months ago when he hit rock bottom. He said: Showbusiness is not all itaposs cracked up to be. Thereaposs barely a one in a million chance that youaposll make it in television, and itaposs not as well paid as you might think. If youaposre  to  then you definitely have a better chance, but as soon as you go over that, no one wants to cast you.It seems programmes only want youyouaposre young.    Iaposm beginning to believe that could be because they think younger people can be more manipulated into doing what shows want them to do. Liam stopped having any work done at the end of last year and is now enjoying a more natural look - apart from when working as a Boy George tribute. He now wants to warn wannabe TV stars not to fall into the same trap he did. He said: I feel guilty that in the past I have gone on about my fabulous showbiz le and my new look - but in reality itaposs not all champagne and parties.You have to work really hard to get anywhere, and sometimes it can ruin your reputation when it comes to doing your regular job.    I used to get messages in my inbox from people as young as  asking me where I got my botox  - I started thinking, what kind of example am I setting to people I realised that isnapost the kind of role model I want to be. I now want to warn people watching Love Island and wishing they could be famous that itaposs an expensive business to become a TV personality.People think itaposs all rosy but it isnapost always the case. TV is a short-lived career. It canapost be sustained.

A term popularised in  during a keynote speech delivered by ex-Prime Minister, David Cameron, the aposage of austerityapos was coined to highlight attempts to curtail government spend and stabilise the economy following the recession. But a decade on - following closures of many publicly-funded initiatives such as libraries, museums and leisure centres - many are still looking after the pennies so the pounds look after themselves. In fact,  per cent are looking for ways to reduce their spending on a daily basis. Shopping in the reduced section, using price comparison sites and withdrawing cash so you can track your spending were among the top ways the nation is keeping a close eye on the purse strings. And seven in  will search the web for discount codes to make ‘luxuries’ more affordable, including treats like spa days, meals out or trips away from home. Buying non-branded foods such as ketchup or beans, making a coffee at home instead of buying one and travelling ‘off-peak’ are other ways Brits are reducing their outgoings.  The study by Microsoft Rewards, the rewards program from Bing, found more than a quarter of people think they have more disposable income now than  years ago, with  per cent putting this down to there being more ways to save money nowadays. Behavioural psychologist, Emma Kenny said, “It appears that in modern consumer society, customers are demanding better deals when making the majority of their purchases. “The positive emotional connection and reward that customers receive after discovering a discount reinforces subsequent shopping behaviour and is a powerful motivator in ing custom. “Undoubtedly, the average consumer no longer feels constrained by the price tags they are presented with and they are happy to spend time online and in the physical world searching for discounts and vouchers meaning their money goes further. “The savvy shopper is fast becoming the largest consumer demographic.”  The study of , adults also found  per cent think they get a better deal online, with the average adult hunting for discount codes online more than once a week. A whopping  per cent of people are also signed up to an average of five dferent reward cards or loyalty schemes. And  per cent will save up these loyalty points to spend when funds are running dry. Four-fths enjoy saving money on everyday items, and two-fths will even boast to their peers when they’ve bagged a bargain. But  per cent of those polled via OnePoll, reckon that no matter what happens in le, they will always look for means to spend less than they need to.  Brian Kealy, international consumer audience marketing director for Bing said: “Our study shows Brits are being more conscious about how they spend their money and it makes complete sense when even simple, everyday items are becoming more expensive. “At Microsoft we wanted to make sure customers earn as they search with Bing.

A ruthless Polish Roma gypsy crime family trafficked hundreds of desperate and vulnerable people while leading lavish lestyles which included a luxury Bentley car. The victims were lured from Poland to Birmingham on the pretense of well-paid jobs and better lives - but many earned just £ a week as the gang stole most of their wages. They would be beaten or threatened by enforcersthey complained, with some revealing their were told they would have to dig their own graves, BirminghamLive reports. One victim has permanently lost the use of his arm after he injured his elbow at work and the gang wouldnapost let him to go to hospital.    A woman was told she would be forced into prostitutionshe continued to complain. When one victim died at a home in Birmingham, gang ringleader Justyna Parczewska, , demanded his ID and personal belongings be taken out of his pockets in a bid to prevent paramedics from identying him and to hide their crimes. Eight members of the UKaposs biggest ever nodern slavery ring have been jailed after two trials at Birmingham Crown Court.    The victims - including rough sleepers, alcoholics, drug addicts and people with mental health issues - lived in horric conditions in West Bromwich, Sandwell, Smethwick and Walsall. They slept four to a room with no beds or bedding in mouse-infested houses. Some slept on used mattresses they had found abandoned in the street. Many of the homes had broken toilets and no flushing water, and one group was forced to wash with water from a nearby canal. The slaves would be moved from house to house at shirt notice, leaving them disorientated.  They were kept in  properties and most spoke no English and had never travelled outside of Poland before. Recruiters were sent to Poland, where they found victims who had just been released from prison, were in a desperate financial situation or were outside homeless shelters or off-licences, the court heard. Some needed cash to pay for medical bills for children, partners or parents. The recruiters ed to the UK with hundreds of people aged from  to their early s - many of them arriving on coaches at the gangaposs base in West Bromwich.  West Midlands Police managed to crack the human trafficking ring thanks to the Hope for Justice anti-slavery charity, which had encouraged the terried and traumatised victims to speak to detectives. More than  victims gave evidence or statements during a five-month trial. Many have since ed home to Poland, and some have stayed in the UK. Parczewska was jailed for eight years, and her husband Ignacy Brzezinski, , was sentenced in his absence after going on the run during the trial. Their home was used as a based for the slavery operation which stole the victimsapos identities and committed financial fraud.  Top news stories from     An expensive Bentley car, linked to Brzezinski, was found at the home. Relative Marek Brzezinski, who was jailed for nine years, brought many of the Polish nationals over in his own car. The Brzezinskis were on benefits but detectives discovered that they had wired money to Poland. Warsaw-born Marek Chowanic, , from Walsall, was jailed for  years, and his partner Natalia Zmuda, , was sentenced to four years and six months for her role. Extremely psychologically manipulative Chowanic had forced the victims to open bank accounts which were then controlled by the gang.  Zmuda stole wages from bank accounts she controlled, and took the victims to job centre appointments for national insurance numbers. Juliana Chodakowicz, who used her position as an account manager at Worcestershire recruitment agency E-response to get jobs for the victims, was jailed for seven years. Unsuspecting and gullible bosses had praised Chodakowicz, who lived in Evesham and was originally from Grudziadz in Poland, for her work in finding labourers for their firms. She had mocked the desperate victims in text messages with other gang members. After being forced to set up bank accounts, the victims were made to work at farms or in manual labour with employment agencies.  They were promised wages of up to £ a week, but they often received less than half as the gang pocketed the rest. The financial exploitation of the victims totalled £,, but £million could be added to that figurethe labourersapos wages and bank accounts were included, the court heard. Gang members Wojciech Nowakowski, , and Jan Sadowski, , met new arrivals and took them to open bank accounts, claim benefits and register with employment agencies. Gang enforcer Nowakowski battered victims and was feared. Police are still trying to find other members of the gang.  Detectives launched an investigation after many of the often starving victims turned to Hope for Justice for food and further help. Ignacy Brzezinski and Nowakowski were convicted of conspiracy to traffic people, requiring them to perform forced labour and acquiring criminal property. Sadowski admitted the same charges. The other five gang members were convicted of the same offences on February  but reporting restrictions prevented them being named until now. A judge praised the “meticulous detective work” of police, who analysed , lines of telephone data,  bank accounts, more than , exhibits and , witness statements.  Police had obtained ten interim Slavery  Trafficking Risk Ordersagainst the gang. Nowakowski and Ignacy Brzezinski breached the conditions and were the first people in the UK to be jailed using STRO legislation. They were jailed for  and  months respectively. After the trial, Detective Chief Inspector Nick Dale, head of West Midlands Police’s Gangs and Organised Crime Unit, said the gang members showed no remorse. He added: “The defendants sat in court listening to evidence and there was no recognition of what they had done or contrition. “They were exploiting anything up to  people in that community at any one time. The evidence of the victims was extremely impactive.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast brits braces","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Britain braced for rain this weekend after heatwaveThe mercury is expected to drop with showers of spell move northerly after it peaked at C on FridayShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video uk-weather-forecast-brits-braces-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrit should expect a temperature drop this weekend, as the short-lived summer heatwave this week takes a break.

She also earns almost £million on top of this from calendar sales while Theresa May - and her eventual successor - is paid just £, to run the entire country.Abigail now wants to use her experience to encourage others to use their social media accounts to make more money. She said: I attribute my success to my perseverance, believing in myself  percent, my creativity, the way I treat others who I work with, and never taking failure to heart.    Abigail didnapost plan to become a model but after her first accidental photoshoot she was inundated with offers to work with brands and started making her fortune. She said: I started building my following after that and once I realised I could make a lot of money through working with brands, selling merch etc, I was hooked. Soon magazines including Esquire, Maxim, Playboy and Sports Illustrated wanted to photograph her. The small town girl, originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania and from a family of seven, moved to LA in  to develop her career. She appeared on several covers and got work on TV shows on TMZ and E! Network.    Meanwhile, social media-savvy Abigail worked hard at developing her Instagram, website and Snapchat.She currently has more than million people followers on Instagram and millions of devotees on Snapchat too. Her latest venture, an app called Escapex , lets fans watch live videos and exclusive content.And rather than label herself an Instagram model or influencer, Abigail insists sheaposs a CEO.

Abigail said: I have big contracts with Ignite and Fashion Nova per month, I also have my own app where people need to pay to subscribe each month for exclusive content.    I also just sold my Snapchat temporarily to a promo company for k a month, and finally my merch which is sold on my website makes me a good amount of money each year.

He knows the things I’m interested in, so that’s what he’ll tend to pursue. Lots of beauty and skincare, bikinis, lingerie, cool apps, all the stuff I would love to use in my normal le. Abigail has advice for anyone hoping to mirror her success. She said: Be creative with your shoots, scope out the best photographers, videographers, locations etc. If you don’t have a manager or an agent yet, contact the brands you want to work with directly.  You get much more respect by being aggressive in this industry than sitting back waiting for things to happen for you. And networking is key to getting more followers. But it isnapost all easy - it can take Abigail two hous to get ready for a shoot.    She said: Definitely make a blueprint of what you want to do. Make a big vision board of all the huge goals you wish to achieve, then break them down into smaller ones. I have whiteboards everywhere in my house. I write out my goals for each month career wise, personal wise, things I want to work on within myself in order to grow and be the best version of myself I can be. Also, connect with the right people, be nice to everyone you work with, build solid working relationships, don’t listen to haters, it’s just white noise, cancel it out and have tunnel vision on your goals and dreams.  aposI love being my own boss, being the creative director of my own le, sharing all the things I love with my fans and being able to make a living off of it.

I know what I have here and I work well with the staff.“I know how big a club this is and I am really happy to be here.“And what is important for me is I want to be one of those players who go in the history books of this club and say he was one who got promotion for the team.“I want to improve and learn every week.

Institute at Aberdeen University came to the conclusion of the project called RuminOmics that the emissions released by cows were controlled by their genetic make-up.The study has been published in the journal Science Advances.Cattle and other ruminants, animals that acquire nutrients from plants, are signicant producers of the greenhouse gas methane and contribute % of the methane emissions.A single cow on average produces between  and kg of methane per year.Prof Wallace said: “When we started the RuminOmics project, all we had was anecdotal evidence that methane emissions were controlled by the cow’s genetic make-up.“Some animals persistently seemed to produce less methane than others, and so did their offspring.“Previously we knew it was possible to reduce methane emissions by changing the diet or by using certain feed additives.“But changing the genetics is much more signicant – in this way we can select cows that permanently produce less methane.”According to the researchers, breeding for low-methane cattle will depend on selection priorities such as meat quality and milk production."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/65886708_10156523683082749_2820945025502806016_n-423x564.jpg ","title":"heading in here 300 wrds

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands.

They are both large, disparate organisations where strong logistical and organisation skills are needed. Teamwork, problem-solving and good communication skills are also essential!ldquoPeople coming in from the forces bring fresh ideas to the business, and itrsquos great to work for a company that has a strong bond with the Armed Forces community. What I like most is that what we do affects peoplersquos lives in a positive way.ldquoOver the  years I was in the RAF, technology and connectivity got better and better. This made communication with families back in the UK possible in a way that didnrsquot happen before.

An interim evaluation took place in December  with minor changes being implemented in January  to address some minor issues.ldquoA more detailed evaluation was conducted in April  which provided useful feedback from students, staff and parents from all nine high schools.ldquoThe vast majority of respondents highlighted the importance of having access to a library for reading, digital, research and study.ldquoThe feedback has been analysed and options for realising the decision of previous council to identy savings is ongoing.ldquoIt will also be critical to ensure that future library provision needs to be equitable across the authority.To which councillor Anderson: ldquoFor Galashiels Academy this has not been a good experience. The school has reported to the parent council that the noise levels in the library has at times been disruptive to other library users and to nearby classes, and excessive litter has been left in the library.ldquoDespite a self-service system that is aimed to be straightforward to operate, books are not finding their way to their correct place in the library once they have been ed.ldquoS pupils have been tasked throughout the year to keep the library running, but they also have their own studies and other activities that they volunteer for.ldquoThe former library service provision has in effect been replaced with a service run by pupils with little or no training, who should not be left to police their peers.ldquoThe perception is that this is merely another cost-cutting exercise by Scottish Borders council with little or no obvious benefit to the pupils.ldquoThis experience has been similar in Eyemouth, in the memberrsquos own ward, and has been backed up by a detailed letter from the chair of Eyemouth Parent Council sent to her and other councillors.ldquoThis backs up the experiences at Galashiels Academy.

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety.

Today, the threat to the ldquohigh street is all about shops, as it is shopping that now defines us. We are consumers, ever exhorted to consume more, and implicitly castigated now for doing it in all the wrong places. That is to say, online, or perhaps in out-of-town malls.This week, the high street minister ndash therersquos a high street minister  who knew  does he cover Scotland  who knows  ndash Jake Berry exhorted punters to stop watching box-sets and get off their butts to waddle forth into the high street, there to spend money on clothes, coffee and, er ndash since itrsquos pretty much all thatrsquos there ndash more clothes and more coffee.It seemed a somewhat inept demand, since we watch box-sets in the evening when the shops are closed, but it was ostensibly prompted by a poll showing that less than half of the apparently important - age group visited the high street every week.I found the idea that they ought to do so quite peculiar since, when I lived in Edinburgh, I never visited the ldquohigh street ndash or city centre ndash from one year to the next.Parking places were few and hideously expensive I never had the massive pile of change necessary for the bus and, besides, the city had authorised large malls and open-air shopping venues on the outskirts of town, where parking was free and plentul, and a chap could stravaig from shop A to shop B without being molested by chuggers, buskers and indigent inebriates.Itrsquos always busy in Union Street and in the nearby malls, so whatrsquos behind the ldquodeath of the high street is a bit of a mystery, eventhe culprit is usually revealed as business rates.At any rate, Mr Berry announced the launch of a high street task force this week, which amounts to experts ndash aye, thaim ndash advising cooncils about how to breathe new le into toon centres.Other great minds have been whirring incessantly and one of these, belonging to Mr B. Johnson, a British leadership contender, came up with a great solution: Brexit, after which everything on the high street will be just dandy. Phew, glad we cleared that one up.Amazon, which is largely blamed for the decline of the high street, is also doing its bit, with the launch of pop-up shops putting new small business on the high street.

Perhaps itrsquos because Irsquom not an exuberant person.Were I to score the winning goal in a cup final ndash something I dream about hourly ndash then I would permit myself a wry smile before accepting a couple of manly handshakes and then ing to my own half timeously so that the other side might have a sporting chance of evening the score.That said,I were on a massive bonus for scoring, I might indulge in a triple-somersault and some light snogging.++++AS regular readers know, I spend large parts of my day thinking about what should happen to my body after Irsquom deid.I wonrsquot be leaving it to medical science, and certainly not to students that they might poke aboot in it.

As Irsquove often been likened to a kind of fertiliser in the past, that does seem apt.This week, with graveyards and crematoria now choc-a-bloc, John Ashton, former president of the Faculty of Public Health, suggested that the sides of motorways, cycle paths or even former industrial sites could be used to house the dead.Not me, mate.

Regarding alleged SNP failures, these are replicated in spades in the public sector south of the Border ndash and we are thirled to what happens there.Mr Howell repeats endlessly the flaws the SNP has, but never promotes any other cause, or any alternative party as an improvement. He does not realise that in criticising the SNP in the way he does, he demeans the integrity of the majority of Scots who troop out in election after election, to vote SNP in numbers unachievable by any other party.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmCOMPETITION: The Orcadian has teamed up with the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland to offer readers the chance to win one of  pairs of tickets for the NYOS Symphony Orchestra’s performance in the Pickaquoy Centre on Wednesday, August .

Service providers are notied of the visit request and receive an overview of the users condition and top tips to aid their interaction with the customer.Gavin Neate, founder and chief executive of Neatebox, said: “Our app helps disabled people to receive a better service, communicate with ease and travel with confidence. Even staff at companies with excellent customer service, like NorthLink, can struggle sometimes to know how best to support customers.We’re delighted that they have seen how the product can help both passengers and staff, and hope that other operators will follow suit.”Seumas Campbell, Serco’s customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “We use the Welcome app to make staff aware of the specic needs of their visitors in advance of their arrival. We can greet customers by name and offer them the assistance they may require. This greatly improves the confidence and interactions between customer service teams and passengers helping to build lasting relationships.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travellers.Earlier this year NorthLink implemented its new ‘Recite Me’ accessibility tool to the website to enable more people to experience the NorthLink Ferries website in a way suitable to their needs.NorthLink staff have also attended disability awareness training with Access Panel Orkney and in , NorthLink teamed up with a sign language interpreting agency to improve access and user experience for its customers with hearing dficulties.For more information Neatebox visit www.neateboxcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Asbestos only poses a health riskdisturbed.You should never carry out major building, maintenance or demolition work on materials that you know or suspect contains asbestos, instead contacting a licenced contractor who can arrange to get the asbestos removed for you.If you only plan to carry out minor work on asbestos containing materials, such as drilling holes for fixtures and fittings, repainting a ceiling or applying new plasterboard, you can do so provided that you’re appropriately trained and know how to assess the risks and work safely.Jonathan Walters OIC environmental services facilities manager said: #From time to time householders may need to dispose of what#s known as hazardous waste # whether that be asbestos, chemical or clinical waste.#We need to ensure that this waste is disposed of properly and safely so additional rules are in place. Full details of these are available on the Council website http:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory R hazardous-waste-materials.htm and also through SEPA.#Where householders don#t stick to these rules, it can cause major disruption at our sites — as we can see with this incident. It also leads to contamination of some our recyclates meaning they can’t be sold on or  used where – thereby reducing valuable income and adding additional cost burdens to the Council.#If you witness misuse at any of the Recycling Centres please do not hesitate to contact the Council to advise and help us to minimise any disruption to our services to the public.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Last year, over £ million was awarded through the three community programme trusts, benefitting thousands of local charities and good causes in every part of the UK.Good causes to have been awarded funding in Orkney include £, for the Papay Development Trust’s kelp store crafts and heritage centre and £, for Orkney Blide Trust to help support those living with mental health problems.Speaking ahead of the event, Mr Carmichael said: “I am very much looking forward to hosting this event for local organisations supported by the People’s Postcode Lottery in Orkney.#Many local projects have been made possible thanks to funds raised by their players, and I am keen to see many more successful applications in future.”Calum Munro, senior community programmes officer at People’s Postcode Lottery added: “We want to do all we can to help local charities and good causes successfully apply for funding from three community programmes trusts.#It is fantastic that funds raised by players of People’s Postcode Lottery are making a huge dference in their own communities.

At the time, the Dexy’s Midnight Runners’ cover version was riding high in the charts and when the song came on, one of my colleagues yelped “Oh I love Dexy’s”. But when I pointed out it was Van the Man himself, she instantly snapped “That’s sh**e”, even though the remake was a faithful tribute to the original. It wasn’t played by the band she liked so, by definition, it was garbage.Last year’s Dexy’s Conundrum was the SNP’s contentment for powers to reside in Brussels but not for those same controls to be held in London, and this week it was the reaction to soon to be ex-Prime Minister Theresa May’s new review of how the UK Government responds to devolution.: Ian Blackford and Theresa May clash over ‘desperate’ devolution review: Theresa May to warn no-deal Brexit risks breaking up UK during final visit to Scotland as PMBroken by The Scotsman on Tuesday and confirmed in a speech in Stirling on Thursday as part of her farewell tour policy frenzy, she has asked ex-Scotland Office minister Lord Andrew Dunlop, a former special adviser to both John Major and David Cameron, to examine how Whitehall works with the devolved administrations. At issue is whether the devolved nations should continue to have separate ministerial departments or, as Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has proposed, there should be a “Union Delivery Unit”.Ms Davidson knows Lord Dunlop very well, first working closely with him in the independence referendum campaign. He recently led her Scottish Future Growth Council, and he has a clear steer from a recentarticle explaining why the unit was needed to ensure “UK legislation is devolution-compatible, that businesses from across the home nations are involved in helping draw up trade policy ... and that civil servants and ministers have a genuine understanding of how power is shared and policy delivered”. Nothing unreasonable, and although Mrs May will be gone in a fortnight, both candidates vying to replace her have clearly expressed their ambition to strengthen the union and the winner would create unnecessary dficultyhe ignored Ruth Davidson or the Dunlop Review.It would be asking too much for the SNP to welcome the review, but the instant reaction was splenetic denouncement as “desperate” and “meaningless”,even though only a fortnight ago First Minister Nicola Sturgeon argued the UK Government had to change the way it interacted with the devolved nations.“Formal frameworks such as the Joint Ministerial Committee are not ing effectively ... meetings only happen when the UK Government chooses. And the committee’s decisions are not binding anyway,” she told the Law Society of Scotland. “There is no sign – none whatsoever – that the UK Government recognises the need for fundamental change,” she added. But having recognised just such a need for change, the First Minister could not have been more dismissive: “It’s for the Scottish people – not a Tory PM – to consider and decide what future we want for our Parliament and country.”Condemned either for action or inaction, the UK Government can’t win, but the clue is in that Law Society speech, when she said that the Scottish Government had commissioned its own assessment which would “draw heavily on academic expertise”.Like the supposedly independent Citizen’s Assembly, now postponed as hastily as it was launched, the SNP will make sure the conclusion is devolution isn’t working. And whatever the Dunlop Review produces, the SNP reaction will be similar to that of a barmaid discovering her favourite Dexy’s tune is being sung by a wee Ulsterman.General Melchett looks set to lead Tories over the top...I was in Perth last night for the Scottish leg of the Hunt v Johnson World Series, eagerly awaited by both Scottish camps but sadly too late for the Perspective section deadlines. It’s been a job to keep up with the flurry of pledges from both candidates, but Mr Hunt laid the groundwork for the Scottish event yesterday with an article aimed at the Scottish business community.On Thursday all members were posted short candidate statements and again the Johnson contribution was al, rounded off with a Boris flourish, sounding rather like General Melchett from Blackadder Goes Forth: “This is it folks. No second chances. Choose me and I will deliver Brexit, unite our country and beat Corbyn.”Mr Hunt included links to a campaign video, his -point Brexit plan and his recent Policy Exchange speech, and dismiss him as a try-hardyou like, but at least he comes across as someone who knows the keys to Number  must be fought for.The ballot papers start landingtoday and whatever happens both sides will have to work together, but with a Conservative Home survey putting Mr Johnson’ on  per cent, no wonder his people think it’s in the bag.... As Monty defends position in FranceOut leafleting down Mountcastle way near where new Brexit MEP Brian Monteith used to live, a craggy old builder shouted, “Whit are ye sellin’ ” When I replied politics, he fired back “Brexit Party  Send them all hame...” “No, sorry, Conservative,” I said, to which he immediately rasped, “Ach, they’re a waste ay f***in’ space” and got on with his digging. I’ll put you down as a maybe, sir. Not every Scot is being dragged out the EU against their will...Meanwhile Monty was in a typically bullish mood on Newsnight when quizzed by Emily Maitlis about his party’s back-turning stunt at the European Parliament opening, swatting off questions about his French residence as “Remoaner ersion tactics”. Whatever his current address and his new party’s politics may be, thousands of Geordies put their cross next to his box.In the same show, Lib Dem MEP Martin Horwood claimed “Nobody wants a super state”, despite new EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen once saying she didn’t “see a loose association controlled by the national interests of a few states”.As I wrote here recently, there are plenty Eurocrats who see Britain as a drag on “ever closer union” and the Lib Dems in Bollocks to Brexit tee-shirts are deluding themselves as much as Brian and the Bring on Brexit brigade who argue only milk and honey awaits us.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"joe nicchi is global hero for taking on corrupt influencers stephen jardine","story":"Beware social media #influencers# who trade good reviews for free stuff, writes Stephen Jardine as he welcomes the global backlash sparked by an ice cream seller in Los Angeles, who has sworn neer to give free ice cream in exchange for publicity.All good food reviewers live by one simple rule. They always pay their way. The best book a table anonymously and do everything possible to make their visit a fair representation of the experience offered by that restaurant. That is why we trust what they tell us.At the other end of the scale are the new breed of Instagram influencers. Some take the same approach as traditional reviewers, posting their visit in an open, fair and honest way. Others are less scrupulous but they are now being served their just deserts.This week Joe Nicchi went viral in a way Instagram influncers can only dream about. However Joe isn’t a millennial with a shiny new laptop. Instead he runs a popular retro ice cream truck in Los Angeles. Sickened by endless approaches from so-called influencers eager to endorse his brand online in exchange for free ice cream, Joe decided to settle the matter for once and for all with his own instagram post. “I will never give you a free ice cream in exchange for a post,” he vowed. Instead, from now on, “influencers pay double”. It was a bold move in a city obsessed with image but as Joe pointed out, online likes don’t pay the bills.: Why NHS fears celebrity ‘influencers’ are damaging children’s health – Stephen Jardine: As a GP, I’m shocked by dreadful health advice from ‘influencers’ – Dr Punam KrishanHis tactic paid off big time with messages of support from other business owners around the world. His social media following has shot up to the point where, ironically, he now has more followers than many of the Instagram effluencers who pestered him for freebies. For some big brands, a relationship with someone on Instagram who has a large following in their target market can be a useful marketing tool. Unfortunately small brands without the budget or need are also now being targetted by hucksters who buy fake followers from China and Russia and spend their days trawling the internet dangling meaningless exposure in exchange for free things.Thankfully the world of Instagram influence is already starting to eat itself. Earlier this year a vegan raw food blogger with two million followers was branded a fake after a video caught her happily sitting down to eat a plate of fish. Last month we had the influencer who shared her apparently surprise engagement which was then shown to have been part of an elaborate marketing campaign to have her wedding paid for. On Instasham, much is not quite what it seems.Ice cream Joe has been one of the first to break the culture of silence around all this but he won’t be the last. This week two UK wedding photographers shared online a remarkable exchange they’d had with an influencer seeking £, worth of photography and video in exchange for endorsement. When they declined the opportunity, they were branded unprofessional and a lot worse.At the end of the day, a few online narcissists seeking free ice cream or wedding photos should generate more pity than resentment. However there is something more worrying about all this. In a world where fake news is a growing problem, who we can trust and why we can trust them is more important than ever before. Your reputation is everything except when it can be bought.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"stefan zweig donna tartt and five other alternatives to usual summer books laura waddell","story":"Writers like Donna Tartt, Elena Ferrante and Stefan Zweig can transport you to a dferent world, writes Laura Waddell.There is a commonly held idea that reading in summer is synonymous with something light and mild, not too demanding or engaging a beach afterthought as insubstantial as froth lapping the shore. But when we think of summer, in the most idyllic sense, our heads fill with colour and warmth. Hazy, dfused circles of heat creeping over snapshots of times past moments of action frozen in time. I don’t want mundane days I want everything in summer to be as full and vibrant as ripe fruit, evenit’s just the extravagant laziness of doing nothing at all to the fullest possible extent.The quintessential summer, in my own mind’s eye, takes the form of one specic picture: sitting on my grandparent’s front steps, eating an ice pole, while the neighbour downstairs gardened and I picked paint off the railing to look at layers of colour underneath. A warm day with the flowers blooming, blue skies and distant lawnmowers, the sweetness in the air of my nana’s roses, suspended in time forever. When my mind wanders, thinking of summer, that moment is always there. I cycle through other scenes: the intention,not necessarily weather-permitting reality, of beer gardens. My papa packing a flask of tea before a day out in the car. Touching the chilly North Sea as a wave comes in. Lying on my back reading, while there’s a breeze blowing in and nothing to do: in a caravan, with the door open and gas stove hiss of tea being made, or rain pattering on the roof. Sometimes I think about being suspended on a plane, with nothing to do but waste away time with a book before stepping out into unfamiliar humidity.: The indignity of modern train travel – Laura Waddell: Fleabag: Priest’s sexual advance has got people talking – Laura WaddellNostalgia is the ultimate Instagram filter, but hope is close behind. When we daydream of the summer we want, we’re not thinking of nothing at all, but of a clearly defined atmosphere, one we want to plunge entirely into, dferent from our everyday lives rather than merely undoing them. Temporarily, we enter alternate reality, whether through memories or hope for how our summer might look. The city itself looks dferent in the sunshine. We rediscover gardens and parks. New ways of being are possible. I walk around looser in my skin, later into the day. We don’t want to drop out of reality entirely – other than a break from everyday chores, tedium, or anxiety – so much as we want to e headfirst into glorious feeling. Sights and sounds, cut crass, chilled wine, and sunshine langour. Summer is intense, in the way that the orange of Aperol spritzes is intense, the smell of lavender is intense, and heat on our brow is intense. Deeper sleeps, longer lies.It’s rarely so idyllic, all of the time. But the best stories, of course, also temporarily take us out of reality and set us down where. And so they are, I feel, the ideal summer reads – like for like. There are some practical considerations. Physically, you’ll probably want a paperback that can be chucked in beach bags or shoved down into a backpack alongside bug spray, water bottles, sandwiches and sunscreen. Books are made for using even an object fetishist like me, who spends a lot of time looking at book cover design, still batters their corners.If I’m travelling I might seek out something set in the destination ahead to double up on discovery. This year, ahead of a pinching-myself lucky work invitation to Vienna to celebrate Bloomsday – books have enabled me to travel to new places, literally as well as figuratively – I dipped back into Austrian author Stefan Zweig’s shorter stories, full of emotion, which often depict longing in settings such as hotel rooms and train stations, reflective of his status as a Jewish intellectual dispersed during the Second World War. His experiences have never felt irrelevant, and his storytelling skills are classic. As I work in the book industry, for summer reading I often choose books I don’t have to review, write about, or recommend in any way. No publication dates looming. A dissolution of everyday demands. It’s a rare, weightless chance to browse shelves without looking for anything in particular, although inevitably, I’ll weigh myself down from trips to bookshops wherever I go.Recently I did an author reading in Shakespeare and Co, the revered, ramshackle, cat-installed English language bookshop in Paris, celebrating the launch of an anthology called We’ll Never Have Paris which invited a sprawling number of writers to depict it as they see fit a theme that emerges is reconciling the Paris of romanticised imagination with the everyday reality. While I was there, I pluckedLauren Groff’s Fates and Furies from a high and tightly packed shelf, a bestseller from a couple of years ago that I’d been meaning to read for ages. It’s a dense and lyrical book exploring one marriage’s successes, sacrices, and hidden rages. While keeping cool from the record-breaking heatwave sweeping Europe, I also read Heartburn by Nora Ephron, a short, sharp satire of eighties New York and Washington society full of wit, humour, and recipes, and Tokyo Ueno Station by Yu Miriwhich shows the city from a rare perspective, that of a homeless labourer asking himself whether years of gruelling work building Olympic stadiums had been worthwhile, capturing the everyday atmosphere of transient camps.In the summer, with more time to wander and get lost, I gravitate towards books that will immerse me in their world some of the very best hazy-dayed reading memories I have include plunging into Donna Tartt’s addictive New England intrigues, Elena Ferrante’s two fists full Napoleon epic that took me through all seasons, and Samanta Schweblin’s eerie Argentinian bio-horror Fever Dream.Each to their own, of course. Wholeheartedly, I believe anyone should read whatever they want, should they choose. But for me, summertime reading will always be something I can travel through, as much as with, taking me to places I don’t yet know or deepening my imagining of those I do, but crucially, upending reality just like a strike of sunlight washing over my face is able to.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow based kilt company to launch world s first vegan tartan","story":"Woven only in animal-free materials, the kilt is designed to celebrate those Scots and tartan enthusiasts from around the world that follow a vegan lestyle.

Ms Sturgeon has said she will ask the new Tory leader for authority to hold a second referendum on independence, as control over the constitution in the UK is reserved to Westminster. This has so far been ruled out by both Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson.Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson has said thatthe SNP wins a majority at Holyrood in two years on a  to stage a second referendum it should happen. But asked directly about this prospect, Mr Hunt ruled even this out.“I’ve made it very clear I’m a Unionist with every fibre in my being sothere is another request for another referendum, the answer will be a polite no,” he said.“I’m a democrat and I remember that in that independence referendum, the SNP very clearly said that this would settle the outcome for a generation and I think they need to be true to what they promised the Scottish electorate, just as we are true to what we promised the British electorate in delivering Brexit.”Mr Hunt pledged that he will work with the Scottish Government on issues like immigration to make progress in the country.“I will engage fully, responsibly and generously with Nicola Sturgeon on everything that helps Scotland move forward,” Mr Hunt said.“But I will not engage with her on the issue of independence which will take Scotland backwards.“And I will certainly not engage with her on the issue of a second independence referendum which is not what the people of Scotland want.”He added: “If she asks for a second independence referendum I will decline in the most British and polite way. But it will be a no.”Mr Johnson also made it clear last night he would rule out granting a second vote on Scotland leaving the UK.“My view is that we had a referendum in , the people of this country were promised it was a once in a generation choice they would make,” he said.“They were told it was a once in a generation promise, I don’t think there is any case for breaking that promise do you ”Askedthis would be the case even under a “democratically elected majority” at Holyrood under the SNP, he added: “I see absolutely no case for having a second referendum in Scotland – I think it’s absurd.”Mr Johnson was again challenged at a hustings about aspects of his personal le. Asked by a Tory member whether a good prime minister needed to be “a loyal husband and father”, Mr Johnson replied: “I think that on these sorts of things, I have been asked all sorts of questions in the last  or  years, and I just don’t comment on that stuff.“What people in this country want to hear is what my plans are to get Brexit over the line, what I’m going to do to unite our country and the ideas I have for a fantastic agenda of modern Conservatism.”The female Tory member who asked the question said that his refusal to answer meant voters would “come to their own conclusion and it may not be a favourable one”.Mr Johnson said: “Then I’m going to have to live with that.”Mr Hunt had made it clear earlier in the day he did not underestimate the threats to the UK after Theresa May warned the previous day in Scotland her successor must seek to protect it.He added: “I do think we need to take the threats to the Union very seriously – I think it’s the most precious thing about our country.”The Conservative leadership candidate said a no-deal Brexit could change the situation on independence and made it clear he did not think enough was being done to prepare for a no-deal scenario in Scotland.“All of us have to do more but to date as I’ve been watching the no-deal preparations I would like to see more focus on that from Nicola Sturgeon,” he said.“[The Scottish Government] have been very disappointing in their preparations of a no-deal Brexit, which none of us want, but any responsible government or authority in the United Kingdom should be taking seriously because there is that risk.”Questioned what more the Scottish Government should be doing, he said: “This isn’t the time to go into details but I think they know, and we know, the areas where more can be done.”Questioneda no-deal could change the situation on independence, the Foreign Secretary said: “If it’s handled the wrong way, yes.“But I’m going to make surewe do end up with a no-deal Brexit that it’s one where we leave no stone unturned in order to mitigate the impact for businesses affected by Brexit whether north or south of the Border.”SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford hit out at the “high-handed arrogance” over a second referendum.He said: “The people of Scotland overwhelmingly voted against Brexit – yet we face being driven off an economic clf-edge by a Tory government which we have also overwhelmingly rejected. This high-handed arrogance from Jeremy Hunt may appeal to the Tory faithful but it certainly won’t appeal to the rest of Scotland.

We should have a real living wage, control of procurement, no public contracts awarded to blacklisting companies, and the right to terms and conditions of work suitable for the st century not the th century.“The Scottish Labour government will use the powers it has to improve the lives of people on benefits both in and out of work. We need to break up the centralisation of politics and wealth and distribute power throughout the UK.“Power must be shared not only between the nations of the UK but also regions and communities.“We need a new way of working together that shares both political and economic power that is based on solidarity and not on competition between dferent parts of the UK.“That means that at last the unelected House of Lords should be abolished. It could be replaced by a Senate of the Nations and Regions that could begin the process of shaking up our political system that for centuries has served the political establishment not the people.”In addition to this he will argue that the private sector can not be relied on to deliver the changes needed to a “green industrial revolution” and new forms of ownership are required.“We will not attain the transformative change we need by leaving it to market forces,” Mr Leonard will insist.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “In , the Scottish low carbon and renewable energy sector supported over , jobs, and generated over £ billion in turnover. This is a signicant result and confirms our commitment to ensuring Scotland maximises the economic opportunity of the transition to a net-zero emissions economy.“We have established a Just Transition Commission to provide ministers with practical advice on the transition to a net-zero economy to ensure that no one is left behind.“The Just Transition Commission, the Scottish National Investment Bank and the Infrastructure Commission for Scotland, will all support the Scottish Government’s approach to meeting our climate change ambitions and create new job opportunities across the country.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

Calum McAuley, an apprentice with Braid Electrical Services, won ‘Apprentice of the Year’.And Jordan Haggan, apprentice electrician with Alexander Bonar  Co, was highly commended in the same category. They were nominated for the accolade alongside another three of their College colleagues. The Northern Ireland Electrical Awards, which represent the pinnacle achievement for the electrical industry in Northern Ireland, recognise and reward the achievements of those working in the province’s erse electrical sector. Organised by the Electrical Magazine and judged by an independent  of respected industry experts, the awards collectively recognise the achievements of both companies and iniduals. Sean McAleese, Training Manager at Northern Regional College, said they are thrilled that the hard work and talent of so many of their apprentices are being recognised at these awards.“We have worked closely with local employers over many years to ensure we are equipping our students with industry-level skills, and these invaluable relationships help us to ensure our students receive training at the very highest level,” he said.Apprentice of the Year Calum, who is currently enrolled on a Level  electrical installation programme, said he always wanted to be an electrician.“I’ve always tried, both in College and on-site, to achieve the very highest standards, in everything I do,” said Calum. “It’s great to have all that hard work and effort recognised with an award like this one.”Jordan Haggan, , said from the outset of his career he spent a lot of time working alongside electricians.“But it took me a while to make the leap of faith and pursue it as a career myself. I thought it was too late to start but the apprenticeship has opened new doors for me, and I really enjoy the work I do and am proud of the new skills I’ve developed,” he said.“This award is really just the icing on the cake for me and it means a lot to be recognised for my hard work.”The  Electrical Awards took place recently at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, in Belfast.

Pig slurry is a good source of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium and producers are reassessing it as a valuable supply of nutrients for grass and crops.What is the fertiliser value of pig slurry  In terms of nutrient supply, a rule of thumb is that a , gallon tanker of undiluted pig slurry has an available nutrient content equivalent to three kg bags of a :: compound type fertiliser. In money terms a , gallon tanker load is worth approximately . Pig slurry is therefore an economical and effective fertiliser. Farmers operating below the kg livestock manure nitrogen per hectare limit have an ideal opportunity to import pig slurry and reduce their reliance on purchased fertiliser and reduce costs.Beef, sheep and predominantly cereal farms tend to be under the  kg N ha yr limit and should consider importing pig slurry. Apart from the major advantage of reducing fertiliser costs,the need for chemical phosphorus fertiliser is eliminated, soil sampling is not required.Pig slurry is a viable, valuable fertiliser.

Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"balmoral master chef provides boost for guide dogs ni","story":"WITH entries for the Balmoral Hotel’s Master*Chef compet-ition drawing to a close on Friday, the competition to find Ireland’s next top chef could also have a positive lasting impact on the work of its charity partner, Guide Dogs NI.Through their efforts, Guide Dogs NI help change the way sight loss affects people’s lives by ensuring that they can get out and about on their own terms. This involves tireless campaigning, fundraising, and, of course, as Guide Dogs NI Engagement Officer, Hannah Lyons explains, the support of iniduals and businesses such as the Balmoral Hotel on the Blacks Road.“It’s wonderful that the Balmoral Hotel have chosen us as their charity partners,” she says.“We are really excited for the upcoming Master*Chef. Fundraising is integral to all of the work that we do. It costs around £, to support a guide dog from birth to retirement. We cover their whole working le as a guide dog including the cost of their food and ongoing training. “Guide dogs are le changing, but there is a lot of work involved in it, so it is essential to have the support from iniduals or organisations like the Balmoral.”As well as raising funds, the Master*Chef competition will also help raise awareness of the work Guide Dogs NI do and inform people of some of struggles faced by the visually impaired.“Our ambition is for a future where everybody with sight loss has the confidence and support to live their lives to the full,” Hannah explains. “A big part of it is access to and experience of services such as shops, bars, hotels and restaurants. We talk about the ‘purple pound’, which is the spending power of anybody living with a disability. We always say that it shouldn’t be underestimated. If someone living with sight loss has a positive experience when they are out and about with any service provider then they are going towith their loyalty and spending power.“We’re quite fortunate here in Northern Irelandthat businesses are supportive on the whole, but we just need to keep that message current and keep it at the forefront of people’s mind. Businesses need to be actively welcoming visitors with disabilities because it isn’t just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.”While there is still plenty of work to be done in making the North of Ireland disability friendly, Guide Dogs NI have helped drive through some vital changes. “We’re somewhat dferent to our counterparts across the water because they’re still campaigning on some of the things that we already have such as audiovisual on buses and disability awareness training for taxi drivers here,” Hannah says.“We have those things in place, so we are lucky in that respect. One of the big things we’re working on at the minute is our pavement parking campaign. Parking is a problem throughout the country but because of rising congestion levels it’s getting worse. It can really negatively impact on somebody’s day when someone un-thoughtfully abandons their car and that visually impaired person then has to turn back or make the decisionthey should walk into the road to complete their journey. That’s a level of stress and anxiety that nobody should have to deal with.”Training guide dogs is, of course, a key part of the charity’s work, but they are now asking for volunteers to become sighted guides for people with visual impairment. “A guide dog sometimes isn’t for everyone and that’s why My Guide is our free service that enables people with a vision impairment to get out of their homes and into the community,” Hannah explains.“With a volunteer as their sighted guide, they can overcome challenges presented by unfamiliar places or crowded areas, enjoy exploring and becoming involved in their local communities and ultimately become more independent. “We provide all the volunteer trainingand ask for a commitment of a few hours once a week to help someone with a visual impairment to get out and about. There are people located across the whole of Northern Ireland currently waiting for a volunteer and it is truly such a rewarding role to take on.”If anyone is interested becoming a sited guide or wants to find out more, they can get in touch with the Guide Dogs NI team at Belfast@guidedogs.org.ukThe Master*Chef grand finale will take place as part of Féile an Phobail at the Balmoral Hotel on Wednesday th of August .For more information, see: balmoralhotelbelfast pro-masterchef"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-02-at-11.22.45.png","title":"meet aaron flanagan","story":"In , Aaron Flanagan and his brother quit their ‘proper jobs’ to open Comic Book Guys, Northern Ireland#s largest independent comic book store and the first-ever authorised CGC dealer.The one-stop shop located on Great VIctoria Street has been serving Belfast’s thriving comic book scene through golden, silver age, bronze to modern comics, movie memorabilia, toys, collectables and even comics made by local creators .In this week’s conversation, we chat all about serving a small market, the impact superhero movies have had on the industry, what it’s like to set up your own business and why a vintage medium like comic books are still thriving today.Check it out.

That compromise was enabled by having a seamless border.\"The backstop insurance policy we agreed with the EU, which would have been activated onlywe were unable to agree our new relationship within the implementation period, respected that compromise.\"And the future relationship will need to respect it.\"It will be for my successor to resolve that issue and I will not today seek to provide any advice on the matter.\"I will simply say this.

Im very proud of it, but Im also surprised and overcome by the enormity of it. Its not something I was expecting at all.\"Born on St Valentines Day, Fr Jude spent the bulk of his career from  to  in Africa before retiring to Dublin, where he is now based, due to his failing eyesight.Having come into the world with his twin brother Fr Brian McKenna, the siblings did everything together - they pursued the same theological studies, were ordained together and then joined the Capuchin Order. It was only when the day came for the young brothers to be allocated postings that the pair got split up, with Fr Brian being sent to Calornia while Fr Jude was given an open ticket to Zambia.Fr Jude said his interest in judo followed on from a love of boxing - he revealed he \"used to box for Ireland when I was a young crazy fellow\" back in the s.He joined the Capuchin Order - an order of friars within the Catholic Church and a branch of the Franciscans dating back to  -  years ago, having yearned to be a priest.\"I always felt the urge that I was being called by God,\" he said.\"After leaving school I spent five years discerning and confirming that was what I wanted and in the meantime I was doing sports, and playing cricket and football and boxing.\"While in Africa, Fr Jude, who has been to Japan three times, said he also picked up \"a few technical words\" of the language.\"I trained orphans, street children, rich people, black, white and coloured Africans for  years,\" he said.And, by way of reward, the Co Antrim priest revealed that \"the Japanese emperor was the one who stamped the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Rays document with his seal\".Fr Jude recently retired from his post in Zambia after  years service where, in addition to his missionary work, he made a major contribution to the development of judo in Zambia and all of Africa. He is getting treatment for his eye condition, macular degeneration, but \"unfortunately its not really working\".He is former president of the Zambian Judo Federation and vice president of the African Judo Union. Since his retirement to Dublin Fr Jude has supported several local judo events including last years Northwest Open in Londonderry and this years Intersity in Coleraine where he was a guest of honour.

Emergency surgery was required to remove it. Thankfully, the operation was a success and Barney is recovering.However, Mr McCloskey said yesterday that an \"irresponsible fisherman\" could have cost Barney his le. \"My we Tracey and I were taking Barney for a walk like we do most evenings along the beach when we spotted him eating something,\" he recalled. \"My we shouted at him to stop and when we looked down, we realised it was discarded fishing line, with hooks and bait attached.\"I didnt know what to do. I was down on my hands and knees trying to take the wire and hooks out of his mouth.

Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.On the afternoon of June , , , young people mdash aged between  and  mdash assembled at Delamont to finally pull the largest megalith in the United Kingdom and Ireland into place.Over the preceding months, the volunteers, recruited from schools and youth groups from all over Northern Ireland, had attended numerous training sessions in preparation for the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch student has a royal date with duchess  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager who battled mental health issues celebrated his th birthday with the ultimate party mdash a date with the Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Cathal McCann, who attends St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, was invited to the palace after he was helped through a mental health crisis by Action for Children Northern Irelandrsquos Blues Programme.His mum, Mandy, said: ldquoHe wouldnrsquot even be here todayit wasnrsquot for Action for Children so to celebrate by meeting Duchess Kate is the icing on the cake.ldquoHe was very low and even self-harming.

That is why we have arranged tonightrsquos meeting and I hope it will be well supported by the people of Downpatrick, across the district and further afield.Mr Morgan claimed many people he has spoken to want change and have an appetite for a new Assembly comprising independent members, not established political party representatives.He continued: ldquoTonightrsquos meeting is the next stage in the campaign and we are approaching this on a county by county basis.

The scheme was originally due to complete at the end of March.Signicant problems which delayed the scheme which the government department described as ldquounforeseen works issues included the discovery of asbestos piping by BT Openreach along both sides of Irish Street, delaying progress by eight weeks.Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station and part of the Irish Street sewerage network.While traders were fully supportive of the regeneration scheme, they expressed anger that the project took more than twice as long to complete than originally planned and that they were not better informed by the government department.In addition, many have expressed surprise at the design of the scheme which has resulted in the narrowing of one of the townrsquos main streets at its junction with John Street and a loss of parking spaces.A number of traders have also questioned why a second footpath has been provided on one side of Irish Street given one was already in place.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said traders, shoppers and residents will be pleased that Irish Streetrsquos two-way traffic flow has been reinstated and hoped that ldquovaluable lessons will have been learned by all those involved with the public realm scheme.Ahead of work on a planned upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction in Downpatrick, which is due to start shortly, he also hopes businesses and residents affected by the work will be provided with regular updates.Five roads converge at the busy junction where roads officials plan to upgrade traffic signals and introduce a new one-way system in Lower Stream Street.The Killough Road merges with Pound Lane, Stream Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue with Cllr Curran hoping disruption will be kept to a minimum.ldquoGiven the nature of this particular junction and the huge volume of traffic it handles on a daily basis, disruption is inevitable, he said.ldquoWhile it is important that road users remain patient and obey any temporary traffic flows which may be in place, roads officials must keep people informed.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWhat happened in Irish Street must not and cannot be repeated.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women.

Deputy Manager of Cats Protection’s Belfast Adoption Centre Andrew Doherty said: “It’s not known how poor Inky broke his leg so badly, but we think he probably burned his ears when he was hiding inside the hot car engine.“His leg was so badly damaged that, sadly, the only option was for vets to remove it. It’ll take Inky a few weeks to recover from the operation, but so far he’s taken it in his stride.“He’s a very friendly and relaxed kitten and is enjoying all the fuss and attention from volunteers and staff at the centre.“Inky isn’t yet available for rehoming, but anyone interested in offering him a new home can keep any eye out for him on our website.“He’ll be able to do most things cats do on his remaining three legs, but as he won’t be able to scale fences or escape from potential dangers as well as four-legged cats can, he’ll be looking for an indoor home.”If you’d like to help the adoption centre pay for Inky’s treatment, you can donate to the JustGiving appeal at: www.justgiving fundraising cats-protection-helpinkyAndrew said: “We’d be extremely gratefulanyone who would like to help Inky could donate to our appeal – every penny will make a huge dference and help us pay for his operation and continued aftercare.”Church call: do not force liberalised laws upon NI Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"As a member of the public found Inky and took him to vet in East Belfast before he came into Cats Protection’s care on Friday, June , the exact location and circumstances of where he was found aren’t known.You can find out more about the work of Cats Protection’s Belfast Adoption Centre in Belfast Road, Dundonald, at: www.cats.org.uk belfast.try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group.

Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.
