The London gallery’s researchers found the Leonardo’s initial designs for the angel and the infant Christ, with “significant differences to how they look in the finished painting”.“Why Leonardo abandoned this first composition still remains a mystery,” a spokesperson said. “Handprints resulting from patting down the priming on the panel to create an even layer of more or less uniform thickness can also be seen, probably the work of an assistant – but perhaps even by Leonardo himself.”A team of six experts started using the latest imaging techniques on the composition in January, and because the drawings were made with material containing zinc, they could be seen in macro x-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) maps, and with infrared and hyperspectral imaging – the same technology that was used by US navy seals to examine Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan in 2011.“Both figures are positioned higher up in the drawing, while the angel, facing out, is looking down on the infant Christ with what appears to be a much tighter embrace,” the National Gallery spokesperson added.The discovery comes as the gallery announces the an exhibition of Leonardo’s work as a painter, focusing exclusively on the Virgin of the Rocks, which originally stood as an altarpiece in a chapel devoted to the immaculate conception of Jesus’s mother, Mary. The museum’s ground-floor galleries will be transformed into a space that investigates the painting and there will be “multisensory experiences” in four rooms, including a chapel-like environment to recreate what its original setting may have looked like.Dr Gabriele Finaldi, director of the National Gallery, said the exhibition would give “visitors the opportunity to explore Leonardo da Vinci’s creative process in making this masterpiece”. The gallery’s head of conservation, Larry Keith, said there could be more discoveries as the team continued to look for more changes.The exhibition has been co-created with 59 Productions, which worked on the V\u0026ampA’s David Bowie exhibition in 2013. “It’s somewhere between an exhibition and an experience,” said Richard Slaney, the company’s managing director.“Da Vinci’s view of the world meant he was fascinated at looking deeply into anything that interested him and by giving people the chance to refocus on one painting we’re allowing people to do the same thing. It’s a bit like mindfulness in a way, as it slows things down and people can focus on one idea,” he added.Slaney said the exhibition would reveal a different aspect of the painting in each room before the main work, the Virgin of the Rocks itself, was revealed at the end. “This is scholarly research that has been turned into an experience that feels theatrical,” he said. “You’re learning by seeing rather than reading a paper.”In 2010, the  art critic Jonathan Jones looked into the provenance of the painting. “Since it was bought by the National Gallery in 1880, the Virgin of the Rocks has been exhibited as a ‘Leonardo’,” he wrote. “But the small print was more complicated.” Jones said that for a long time the gallery believed it was mostly the work of assistants, with possibly only the basic design recognisable as Leonardo’s.In 2005 researchers discovered that the Virgin’s pose had been changed, and in 2008 its restoration started. This included the oil and varnish that was applied in 1949 being cleaned and the work being installed in a new frame that was constructed from fragments of a 16th-century original.In May this year, a sketch of a bearded man – found in among the Leonardo drawings contained in the Royal Collection – was identified as a work by the painter.“It is a very quick casual sketch of Leonardo it is the closest that we get to a snapshot of Leonardo during his own lifetime,” said Martin Clayton, head of prints and drawings at the Royal Collection Trust. “It may be trivial as a work of art but it’s hugely important, even moving, as a record of the man himself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17b5064ecdea8511942482b0ec9dd30cdc331d9e/0_0_1349_2000/master/1349.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5c1a32323582868a9bbe7f08b4b8b3b1 1400w","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost.

The principles in the book can be applied to gardens of any size … I wholeheartedly recommend it.The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 and ¾ by Sue Townsend still works for writeronthestorm:Taking me back to my childhood when I borrowed this off my older brother and thought it was hilarious… It still stands up as a funny and enjoyable read. I’ve got the next couple of books in the series and will move onto them at some point.For the 15th time I think. I call it my summer book. It never fails to delight me.Mission To Tashkent by Frederick Marshman Bailey has impressed SchwarzwaldBummel:An incredible true-story romp about an English spy hired by Lenin’s Cheka to capture himself. Bailey a national treasure who deserves more recognition.“Thank you to everyone on here who recommended Elizabeth Taylor,” says Rick2016. “Without Tips, Links and Suggestions I’d never have discovered Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which proved wonderful”:It’s a quiet, understated book, but every line is so well crafted and has such power. The lessons it teaches are, when you write them down, obvious. Everyone needs love, physical contact, to feel wanted and like their company is a pleasure, not a burden. And yet it’s so easy to forget that everybody else feels these things in the cavalcade and clamour of everyday life.. Elizabeth Taylor’s empathy, compassion and ability to portray the irreducible human core of her characters are utterly remarkable and I thoroughly recommend Mrs Palfrey ... to anyone who hasn’t read it.More good work by you guys: FrogC has started reading When Mystical Creatures Attack by Kathleen Founds, “following a tip from a reader of this column”:It’s a series of linked short stories about a high-school class in Texas, most of them troubled, and their teacher who is equally so, being confined in a sort of capitalist asylum where they give Wellness Points(TM) for fulfilling various therapeutic tasks. The construction is ingenious - you might say gimmicky, but I like that kind of thing: the title story, for example, consists of the essays written by the students on how their favourite mythical creature might solve some world problem (though a lot of the problems chosen, inevitably, are on a more personal scale). Funny and moving. I love the fact that the most feared teacher is referred to simply as “The Sir”.Alexia_R has been pleased to pick up The Runaways by Fatima Bhutto:I picked this up on a whim in Foyles because it was a beautiful, signed copy. It’s a fast-paced story of three Pakistani young people (one of them British-Pakistani), negotiating their culture, religion etc. One of them is gay and struggling to accept it, another is from a very privileged background, another is from a slum of Karachi. I can’t say too much about the plot without giving it away. I was absolutely loving this and was about to praise it to the skies but I wasn’t too sure about the ending. Still, very good.RedmonT has almost finished Purity by Jonathan Franzen:Not quite as good as The Corrections and Freedom, but then that might only be because of how the account of Tom and Annabel’s relationship makes me feel. It’s awful – the feeling of dread I felt throughout that section, the nerves, the butterflies, the absurd behaviour. It’s been a long time since a book made me feel that way.He is amazing at threading stories together. It doesn’t even matter that it’s occasionally haphazard - realising things in a non-linear order affects the way you realise them (and changes what you thought you knew). There have been two or three moments that made me sit up and exclaim “FUCK” or “OH MY GOD”.I think he does something inwith his books that no other living writer does.Catch-22 attracts all the plaudits but this is well worth checking out as a study of the office environment and the feeling of ‘Is this all there is?’ It’s as sharp as TV’s Mad Men, which I suspect was influenced by it. I read about one third of the book in a single evening until the early hours. It’s that good.It is that good.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

There are Instagram accounts, podcasts and even subscription boxes dedicated to reading. Chances are you’ve noticed your friends joining book clubs or posting beautifully lit bookstagram photos. Reading is – if it ever was – cool again.Why? Perhaps for the same reason we’ve seen a surge in interest in hobbies such as jigsaws and cross-stitch: right now, our brains are saturated with digital information so it’s no surprise that we’re returning to unplugged hobbies. (But also going online to talk about them.)Being overwhelmed by information has shattered a lot of our attention. As a child with undiagnosed ADHD, I read voraciously because my brain needed constant stimulation and I didn’t yet have a phone to distract me. But as the internet became part of my life, reading lost ground and in my early 20s, I went a year without reading a book at all. But by making a conscious effort to read – partly, I confess, because of recommendations on Instagram – I’m back up to at least one book a week.It hasn’t been easy. I’m still busy, I still have ADHD and I still have myriad distractions. But here is what I’ve learned, and what might help you to fall back in love with reading in a way that fits in with our ever-online world.1. Follow book accounts on social mediaIf you’ve been away from reading for a while, it can be hard to know where to start. It can also be really tough to go from living your life online to building a separate one. By following Instagram accounts that regularly post about books, you’ll get ideas: try Book of the Month, Books on the Subway and Strand Bookstore for beautifully shot recommendations. 2. Read what you want toIf you haven’t read in a while, it can be tempting to set yourself lofty goals. For many of us that’s unrealistic, so instead: are there particular topics you’d love to read a non-fiction book about? Is there an author you’ve found easy to read before who has other books? Is there a favourite you can reread? When I’m finding it tough, I often punish myself by trying to slog through something hard before I let myself enjoy something that’s 200 pages and a laugh. But it’s enjoying the 200-pager that gets me in the swing of things, and makes it easier to concentrate on something tougher.3. Join a libraryLibraries are dying, and it’s partly because a lot of people don’t seem to consider them an option. But if finances are holding you back and you can trek to a library, it’s worth it. You can get recommendations, read for free and give up on books you can’t get into. Many have book clubs, too. For readers in the UK, you can find your nearest library here.4. Make a TBR (to be read) listHaving a realistic to-do list can be a great motivator. You can easily put one together on Goodreads, where you record what you’ve read, want to read and have read. You can also add friends, which introduces a competitive element and holds you accountable. 5. Try audiobooksIf you really can’t concentrate on reading – or set the time aside – maybe it’s a good idea to try a service such as Audible. Sure, people can be snobs about audiobooks, but they shouldn’t be. You still get the exact same information, and can participate in all the chats about the biggest book of the summer – but you can get it done while cooking dinner or out walking.6. Can’t escape your phone? Put books on itBetween work, friends and everything else, it can be hard to imagine finding time every day to read. The chances are, though, that you could. Do you commute? If you’re not forced to work on it, you can read. Lunch break? Read! I’m guilty of flicking between social media accounts whenever I get a spare five minutes. But it is just as easy for me to open the Kindle app on my phone as Twitter. Reading ebooks can be more expensive than secondhand books – but reading on my phone is often the only way I can commit.• Do you have any tips on overcoming distractions or finding your love of reading again?

He told the Financial Times that the investigation should look into why the networks allowed power to be cut to critical infrastructure such as railways and hospitals.National Grid has said that the rare blackout was caused by a sudden drop in the energy system’s frequency - or energy intensity - after two unexpected generation outages within minutes of each other.In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Pettigrew denied that the grid’s frequency had fallen to dangerously low levels with increasing regularity in the three months before the blackout.To safeguard the energy grid, the industry regulator expects National Grid to keep the grid’s frequency at about 50Hz and no lower than 49.5Hz. The grid’s frequency fell to 49.55hz on 9 May, 49.52Hz on 20 June and 49.58Hz on 11 July.Energy industry sources and experts agree that the energy system has become more volatile in recent years.Thomas Edwards, an analyst at the energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: “We’ve observed that the fluctuations in frequency are getting wider. Frequency levels are less clustered around 50Hz compared to three years ago and we can see a clear trend of higher volatility in the system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4305f27995f97ad562b7b5594b8f3f3155b7ecb7/0_0_5757_3454/master/5757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28719bdf421dafffc4ad2c9215225e3f","title":"germany economy shrinks gdp recession uk inflation stock markets business live","story":"Investors are alarmed to see longer-dated UK and US bonds trading at lower interest rates than shorter alternatives, a possible sign of recessionTime for a recapStocks have plunged on both sides of the Atlantic as fears grow that America could fall into recession, dragged down by a global slowdown and the trade war with China.In London, the FTSE 100 tumbled by more than 103 points, hitting its lowest closing level since March.The selloff was sparked by alarm that both the US and UK government bond yields inverted today, as bond prices soared. That means that traders are accepting a lower interest rate to hold longer-dated bonds than the shorter-dated alternative.An inverted yield curve is an unusual situation that typically only happens before a recession, at least in America. It’s a classic warning light, which has flashed ominously brightly today.However, some experts - including former top central banker Janet Yellen - believe that a recession can be avoided. They believe the bond market is predicting low growth in the future, but hopefully not a full-blown downturn.The White House has responded by renewing its call for US interest rate cuts soon. President Trump claimed the Fed had made two huge mistakes, while trade advisor Peter Navarro predicted borrowing costs would be slashed in the coming months.Germany’s economy suffered from a slump in exports, due to trade war tensions. Economists believe that Berlin should boost government spending quickly, to prop up growth. Otherwise, Europe’s largest economy could soon fall into recession.Newsflash: President Donald Trump has launched another salvo at Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell.Trump is unhappy with the way Powell presented last month’s interest rate cut, and (as usual) is pushing the Fed for more aggressive cuts.Given the torrent of criticism from Trump, Powell may feel his first mistake was accepting the offer to run the Fed at all!The president has also appeared to welcome the plunge in US bond yields today, caused by a dash to buy Treasury bills.Former Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen believes the markets may be wrong in assuming that the inverted US yield curve is signalling a recession.Speaking on Fox Business, Yellen said that this time things are different....“Historically, it has been a pretty good signal of recession, and it think that’s when markets pay attention to it, but I would really urge that on this occasion it may be a less good signal.The reason for that is there are a number of factors other than market expectations about the future path of interest rates that are pushing down long-term yields.”Yellen also believes that America will avoid a recession, but revealed she is becoming more concerned:I think the U.S. economy has enough strength to avoid that, but the odds have clearly risen and their higher than I’m frankly comfortable with.”Ouch! The Dow Jones industrial average has now lost more than 700 points, as Wall Street traders continue hammering their sell buttons.Recession fears are flooding over the trading floors, even though several economists have cautioned against panicking over the inverted US yield curve.As David Madden of CMC Markets puts it:The inversion of the US 2 year yield and the US 10 year yield has sent shockwaves through the markets, and that has forewarned recessions in the US, and traders are running scared.The major indices sold-off sharply for fear the US is heading for a recession. The underlying fundamentals are solid as the jobless rate is at multi-decade lows, and average earnings are outstripping inflation, but for now dealers are focusing on the yield curve, and equities are taking a hammering.Economics expert Duncan Weldon has written a interesting thread about today’s bond market developments.He argues that the slump in bond yields shows anxiety about growth prospects, but not necessarily a recession.Why? Because previous recessions have often been caused by rising interest rates (to cool inflation), while today’s central banks are likely to cut borrowing costs (where possible) to stimulate growth.Bloomberg’s Michael McDonough makes a good point -- who will get the blame if America slides into recession?Many economists would point to the US-China trade war, which has disrupted the global economy and contributed to the slowdown.President Trump, though, has already blamed the US Federal Reserve for raising interest rates too high (nine times since the financial crisis ended), and being too slow to respond (it’s first cut in a decade came last month)The Fed’s next meeting is on September 17-18th, where it could lower borrowing costs again.But Steen Jakobsen, Chief Economist \u0026amp CIO at Saxo Bank, claims the Fed might have to unleash an emergency rate cut to calm the markets.He told clients today that the Fed is behind the curve:The only way to “move” market now in my opinion being moving between scheduled meetings.They need to produce faster or more. Both is likely, but by faster would be my choice! Rip off the band aid.Here’s a video clip of White House trade advisor Peter Navarro predicting hefty cuts to US interest rates this autumn:Wall Street is showing a distinct reluctance to bounce.Today has seen investors scramble desperately into safe-haven assets, such as government bonds and gold, and out of the risky stuff including oil and shares.That’s driven bond yields to record lows (Germany’s benchmark 10-year bund fell deeper into negative yield territory), and pushed stock markets to their weakest point in several months.European stock markets have hit their lowest level in six months:Newsflash: Britain’s FTSE 100 stock index has just closed, down 103 points at 7,147.That’s its lowest closing level since March this year, and means the index has lost over 400 points since the start of August.In the City, the FTSE 100 is being dragged lower and lower too.Fiona Cincotta, senior analyst at City Index, says fears of a global downturn are stalking the markets:Doom and gloom dominated after data showed that Chinese industrial output grew at the slowest pace in 17 years, whilst the German economy contracted.Recession warning bells rang out across the markets as Trump’s delaying of tariffs on some Chinese imports is a case of too little too latte – the damage to economies has already been done.Here’s a reminder that inverted yield curves don’t IMMEDIATELY lead to recessions it can take a year or more.Investors have been snapping up long-term US government debt today, sending the yield (interest rate) on 30-year Treasury bills to record lows (meaning prices are at record highs).A US recession may be approaching, but it might not actually arrive for a couple of years.So argues Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, who predicts the downturn could be delayed until 2021, if central bankers take action.“The US economy is clearly weakening and risks are piling up. Capex will inevitably slow further, but under the assumption that the trade war doesn’t escalate further, it will not weaken so much as to tip the US into recession. The Fed pivot in early 2019, global central bank easing, China stimulus and the reversal of its deleveraging process will support the global economy. Certainly our own recession risk model suggests that while the probability of a US recession has increased, it still isn’t our central scenario.“Notably the historical success of the yield curve as a recessionary signal is too strong to dismiss. However, the lead time of its signalling can be several years, so it is our best bet that while recession is unlikely in 2020, the following year may be a fairer bet as concerns about leverage in the corporate debt maker start to come to the fore. Even so, there are certainly enough risks globally to prompt investors to take reasonable defensive positioning in their portfolios right now.Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, says this morning’s weak German GDP report has helped to drive bond yields down today.He also cites poor Chinese industrial data released overnight, showing the smallest rise in factory output since 2002 -- another sign of economic slowdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f849a88f6fc0e7ef4d08b1afa21da1bc099b9937/68_387_3432_2059/master/3432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3800f124d155d7cbfbfb744e46680cf","title":"britain social infrastructure money national grid","story":"Whole swaths of Britain experience a blackout and the country lights up with fury. Cabinet minsters, the press, members of the public rightly demand answers: why was Newcastle airport plunged into darkness? Who is responsible for rail services being halted for hours? Threats are issued of a whopping fine, an official inquiry, heads rolling. Days of rage for a power cut of less than an hour.When it works, infrastructure is invisible. Point out the crumbliness, by all means, and lament the dangerous compromises – but as long as the wretched system judders on, voters shrug and politicians look the other way. Until the day the bridges collapse, the trains seize up and the lights no longer come on. By which time it is too late for anything but blame in 24-point headlines.Between these two extremes lies a much rarer phenomenon, which blights Britain today. We are right in the middle of an infrastructure breakdown – we just haven’t named it yet. You’ll know what I mean when we list the component parts. More than 760 youth clubs have shut across the UK since 2012. A pub closes every 12 hours. Nearly 130 libraries were scrapped last year, and those that survive in England have lopped off 230,000 opening hours.Each of the above is a news story. Each stings a different group: the books trade, the real-ale aficionados, the trade unions. But knit them together and a far darker picture emerges. Britain is being stripped of its social infrastructure: the institutions that make up its daily life, the buildings and spaces that host friends and gently push strangers together. Public parks are disappearing. Playgrounds are being sold off. High streets are fast turning to desert. These trends are national, but their greatest force is felt in the poorest towns and suburbs, the most remote parts of the countryside, where there isn’t the footfall to lure in the businesses or household wealth to save the local boozer.When I am out reporting it is not uncommon to go into a suburban postcode short of money yet still bustling with people – but the banks have nearly all cleared out, the church has gone and all that’s left of the last pub is an empty hulk. The private sector has buggered off, the state is a remote and vengeful god who dispenses benefits or sanctions, and the “big society” never made it out of the pages of a report from a Westminster thinktank. I’ve seen this in the suburbs of London and in the valleys of south Wales, and the word that most comes to mind is “abandoned”.Politicians bemoan the loss of community, but that resonant word is not precise enough. A large part of what’s missing is social infrastructure. It can be public or private. It is often slightly dog-eared and usually overlooked. But when it vanishes, the social damage can be huge.The American sociologist Eric Klinenberg lists some in his recent book, Palaces for the People: “People reduce the time they spend in public settings and hunker down in their safe houses. Social networks weaken. Crime rises. Older and sick people grow isolated. Younger people get addicted to drugs … Distrust rises and civic participation wanes.” A New York University professor, Klinenberg’s observations hold as true for Brexit Britain as they do for Trump’s America. How often have you read about a grandmother found dead in her own home, with no one popping by for days? How many news stories do you read about teenagers experiencing mental illness as they compare themselves to the images on their screens? And how many times have you complained that everyone is so stuck in their own bubble that politics is hopelessly polarised?When it comes to transport or energy or sewage, Britain has a National Infrastructure Commission that monitors the country’s needs and guides parliament on where to direct spending. After all, the quality of such hard infrastructure influences where multinationals set up shop: it is money-making. But parks and libraries don’t generate cash. Social infrastructure has no lobby, no registry of assets and certainly no government agency. No Whitehall official monitors how much of it has closed or withered away – that relies on civil society groups to file freedom of information requests or badger town halls with survey. Everyone knows we need it, yet just as our economic model prizes shareholder returns over investment in the National Grid, so our politics relies on drawing in the voters with unfeasibly low taxes. Until one day, something breaks and all hell breaks loose.So here is a suggestion for Jeremy Corbyn or Nicola Sturgeon or Adam Price or whoever else fancies it. Talk about the importance of social infrastructure. Promise to set up a commission explicitly to audit what we have and help protect it. Commit public money to it, alongside gentle pressure on the private sector to do its bit. That way, we can publicly mark the public institutions we all know we need – and show the esteem due to the people who keep them going and use them. The spirit we need is that summed up by the librarian who rhapsodises to Klinenberg about his branch: “The library really is a palace. It bestows nobility on people who can’t otherwise afford a shred of it. People need to have nobility and dignity in their lives. And, you know, they need other people to recognise it in them too.”Our people deserve palaces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76917b5409fde1e049a45ce058d9ee5fd7649685/0_75_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34f6db7b5947f3eaff67ce9f0fa1dbe1","title":"jeffrey epstein conspiracy theories case","story":"Mishandling of the billionaire’s case has prompted a crisis of public trust. The investigation must continueJeffrey Epstein, the shady businessman accused of running a child sex ring that allegedly catered to some of the world’s richest and most famous men, is dead, reportedly from suicide in a Manhattan federal jail. It’s an infuriating, unjust end that leaves Epstein’s victims with justice undone and the many of us watching this case with questions unanswered. But the end of Epstein’s life can’t mean the end of the inquiry into his deeds – and those of the many people who allegedly looked the other way, or even partook.That Epstein was even able to die by suicide suggests a huge breach. He was the nation’s most notorious federal prisoner at the time he apparently took his life, and had reportedly attempted suicide just weeks earlier. The world’s eyes were on Jeffrey Epstein – but prison guards apparently looked the other way. The first step in seeking justice must be a thorough inquiry into what went wrong. Why was Epstein so loosely monitored? Why was he removed from suicide watch? Why was he in his cell alone, contrary to protocol? Guards were supposed to check on him every 30 minutes – why, that night, didn’t they? How is Epstein’s alleged co-conspirator, Ghislane Maxwell, reportedly somewhere overseas and unaccounted for? And most importantly, who were the decision-makers at the top? All those who enabled this absolute failure of incarceration should pay a significant professional price.Online, conspiracy theories now abound. Observers suggest Epstein was killed by one of the men who may have been implicated in his crimes – maybe Bill Clinton, according to the fringe right, or maybe Donald Trump, according to the fringe left. The entire Epstein case has been shrouded and illusory, which does suggest that there is something darker, and deeper, than we are all seeing. Why else did Epstein get such a sweetheart plea deal from Alex Acosta,a former US attorney from Florida and then Trump’s labor secretary – a deal that, because it did not inform Epstein’s victims, violated federal law? That Epstein evaded true justice for so long, and then managed to cobble his reputation back together after serving his (short and gentle) time, had already raised suspicions of which powerful people had an interest in his discretion. That he was able to end his own life while supposedly under federal watch in a secure facility only feeds into the perception that the shadowy and powerful are pulling some dangerous strings behind a facade of justice.This is dangerous even if it’s not true. America’s criminal justice system, like our government generally, only functions if the population trusts it. The official explanation for Epstein’s death comes down to rank incompetence. And it’s probably true. But of course in this broader context it is fueling conspiracy theories. Of course even those of us who are skeptical of conspiracy theories are pausing here to wonder how this guy got away with so much – and whether the secrets of a great many rich and powerful men will die with him.The only answer is to refuse to let this inquiry end with Epstein’s life. An independent investigating body must look at every decision that was made, and every person involved, in the lead-up to Epstein’s death. Federal prosecutors have already said that they will continue their criminal inquiries into anyone associated with Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking operation. I hope now that Epstein is dead, his accusers will push even harder in their civil cases against his estate (although of course his death may also create some uncertainty and fear in vulnerable young women).The saddest part of this story is that the many women who say they were abused by Epstein as girls are now unable to look him in the face and demand he answer for his alleged crimes. Thanks to Epstein’s death, we may never get the full story. But every person who contributed to this spectacular failure must be held accountable. And every entity that was going after Epstein, from federal prosecutors to lawyers in civil court, should redouble their efforts. Epstein, a narcissist and coward until the end, escaped his obligation to face down the consequences of his abuses. His enablers must not be similarly relieved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecafd6afcbbd9fc5443d703b12dc985dc848c39d/0_187_5287_3173/master/5287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26fde7805c20c3bfae6d8380ab81e7c4","title":"narendra modi kashmir hindu first india autonomy","story":"Narendra Modi’s nationalist takeover runs roughshod over Kashmir’s special status and its people’s rightsI haven’t been able to hear the voices of my parents for more than a week now. We usually talk or exchange messages a few times during the day, mostly about their creeping health issues or about my children’s latest antics here in London. But now, not a peep. It’s because, like all Kashmiris, they’re under siege, experiencing the worst crackdown in three decades, imposed by the Indian government as it revoked the region’s autonomy by abrogating article 370 of the constitution.The article, dating back to 1949, guaranteed Kashmir’s special status within the larger Indian union and enshrined the conditions of the state’s accession to India soon after partition in 1947. The newly created states of India and Pakistan had gone to war over Muslim-majority Kashmir, an independent kingdom at the time. After mediation from the United Nations, all parties agreed that the future of Kashmir was to be decided later via a referendum – something India and Pakistan have failed to honour. The provisions of the article meant that, pending the final resolution via a plebiscite, the state had its own constitution, its own national flag, a prime minister and a president, even as successive Indian regimes, starting in the early 1950s, diluted the article in order to diminish Kashmir’s autonomy.India has also abrogated article 35A, introduced in 1954. It empowers the state legislature in Srinagar, the capital, to define who is a permanent resident with the right to buy property and apply for jobs. It’s the dissolution of this article that perhaps presents a graver threat to Kashmiris, as it potentially clears a way for Indians to acquire land.By erasing what was left of its independence the government of India, led by Narendra Modi, has chosen to unilaterally alter the future of an entire people (who have never submitted to Indian sovereignty). Not only that, it has effectively instituted a mass detention of Kashmiris by rushing in thousands of troops in addition to the half a million already stationed there.All of this happened without any consultation with Kashmiris, without any discussion among India’s own parliamentarians, and, most crucially, without any sound legal foundation. Article 370 can only be amended with the approval of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, which was dissolved in 1956. In its absence, it falls to the legislative assembly of Kashmir to debate and approve any changes to the article, but India suspended that in November last year, putting the state under its direct rule. In place of an elected government, Delhi sent a governor to rule Kashmir.Legal and Kashmir experts agree that a man who’s neither elected nor a representative of the Kashmiri people cannot be a surrogate for an elected body. The necessary legal approval for the revocation, according to India’s own constitutional guarantees, was never sought, therefore rendering the whole exercise a farce, a travesty of democratic norms.As part of this shock-and-awe move, political and civil leaders in Kashmir, including unionists who’ve been arguing India’s case, have been arrested. The entire population is under the severest curfew in decades and an unprecedented communications blockade has been put in place, with mobile phones, broadband, even landlines blocked. The world’s largest democracy has cut off Kashmir from the rest of the world.The decision, however, has wide support across India. Most political parties, most of the Indian media, film stars, some writers – everyone seems to say in unison: take away the rights of these ungrateful Muslims. Imagine a small landlocked region with a few million people incarcerated in their own homes, up against a mighty power, its army, its people, its media, and you get a sense of the crushing injustice of the situation.India’s treatment of Kashmiris is the clearest glimpse yet of the path that Modi, a Hindu nationalist leader, wants to tread. His vision is for a majoritarian, Hindu-first nation where all debate, difference and dissent will be crushed. The rebellious others on the margins, especially if Muslim, are to be subjugated and subjected to a medieval siege to force them to bend to the will of the mega-state. For some, this comes complete with references to spoils of war. Two lawmakers from the ruling party, including a chief minister, have made jokes about “bringing in girls” from Kashmir.Kashmiris will inevitably see this new attack on their body politic as part of a long list of betrayals, and it reinforces the idea that India’s behaviour towards Kashmir has always been like that of a coloniser. The erasure of autonomy, however tenuous, however token, is the starkest display of that relationship – and it’s important to remember that Kashmir is subject to the densest militarisation on the planet. A video filmed by the BBC shows thousands protesting after Friday prayers in Srinagar. Another video, recorded by Indian journalist Siddharth Varadarajan, shows boys in hospital beds who’ve already been hit in the eyes with lead pellets.As statist Indian journalists (some of whom have been given access to Kashmir while most local journalists remain incommunicado) work overtime to project a narrative of normality, it has fallen to the international media, and a few brave Indian outlets, to report the truth. The BBC, the New York Times, Reuters, Al Jazeera, the , the Wire India, Scroll India,  India and a few others have shown protest marches, wounded civilians, and a grieving people seething with anger, despite the unprecedented siege.Addressing the people of Kashmir in 1952, India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, said: “Kashmir is not the property of India or Pakistan. It belongs to the Kashmiri people ... We have taken the issue to the United Nations and give our word of honour for a peaceful solution. As a great nation, we cannot go back on it. We have left the question of final solution to the people of Kashmir and we are determined to abide by their decision.”India has now done exactly what Nehru ruled out, going back on its word, and scripted a final betrayal of the Kashmiri people. The journey from being a colony of the British empire to colonising the unyielding Muslim other next door reveals a catastrophic mutation at the heart of the Indian state.I asked a Kashmiri journalist who had returned to Delhi after spending two days in the state if he knew where it was all headed. He responded with one word, Falasteen, the Urdu for Palestine – a clear reference to the settler-colonialist occupation there.I pray that when I go home next, I do not visit my parents in a colony of the Hindu nationalist empire.• Mirza Waheed is a journalist and author of the novels The Collaborator and The Book of Gold Leaves"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb28349a6efff7b2743fda632b234372e9a4afc6/348_679_3147_1888/master/3147.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7ae1406aeff2829b0bf89b981990f37","title":"the guardian view on brexit and the economy storm clouds on the horizon","story":"Former chancellors often criticise serving prime ministers but usually when they represent different parties. The case of Philip Hammond is all the more remarkable: only a month has elapsed since he sat in the Treasury and already he is savaging Boris Johnson for pursuing a no-deal Brexit.On that point, the two men might as well be in different parties. Mr Hammond is conservative in an old-fashioned sense of the word – inclined to preserve things suspicious of ideology fiscally hawkish. Mr Johnson represents the new style of conservative radicalism – contemptuous of governing conventions, profligate and prone to nationalistic bombast. Both would describe themselves as Eurosceptic, but for the former chancellor that means wariness of the federalising side of the European project. For the prime minister it extends to aggressive severance of Britain’s ties to the continent, without alternative arrangements.Mr Hammond knows that would be an act of national self-harm. He also claims to have had private assurance from Mr Johnson that every effort would be made to avoid a no-deal Brexit. He accuses the prime minister of reneging on that commitment by taking dictation from “unelected advisers” who are sabotaging any prospect of constructive talks with the EU. It is a serious charge – weakness, recklessness and duplicity. Mr Johnson’s allies counterattack by accusing the former chancellor of having undermined the UK’s negotiating position when he was in the Treasury by failing to make adequate preparation for the no-deal scenario. That is like accusing someone of failing to put an armoured boot on their own foot in case they might one day want to shoot at it.Brexit plays a complicated role in this picture because it has not yet happened. A partial economic downgrade is manifest in sterling’s depreciation (which can stoke prices by making imports costlier). But in other areas – employment, for example – the UK has proved resilient amid great uncertainty. That has bred complacency among hardline Brexiters.The 2016 referendum did not precipitate a crash, partly thanks to a central bank intervention and partly because markets expected an orderly transition. (Some Europeans doubted Brexit would happen at all.) The remain campaign’s direst warnings – “project fear” – were not realised. Emboldened leavers have denigrated their pro-European rivals for crying wolf ever since. That jibe resonates with voters who want to believe that Brexit can be a success, although it is worth remembering that in the original fable there was, in the end, a real wolf.The economic risks of Brexit might have been crassly mobilised for campaigning purposes but that does not make them imaginary. And every credible analysis makes it abundantly clear that the no-deal scenario is the riskiest of all – too reckless to entertain even in economic conditions more benign than the ones that Mr Johnson is now facing this autumn. In a serious administration, well-staffed with financially literate people, that would not be a controversial view. But it falls to Mr Hammond to spell it out from the backbenches because the prime minister heeds only those who willingly turn their backs on responsible government and economic reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df178c09a8d7005c6143cde1994f088dbfae423/310_0_2538_1524/master/2538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=673c2d485d6ea2779aedde7ed62837f3","title":"english a level tell us whats driving the drop in take up of the subject","story":"We want to hear from students and teachers why English is declining as a choice for A-level pupilsOnce a popular subject choice for sixth formers, schools are now seeing a sharp drop in the take-up of English literature and language at A-level.Some blame the recently reformed English GCSEs for “sucking the joy” out of the subject, while others suggest the push for vocational secondary education is stopping people from choosing it.We want to hear from students, educators, parentss about why you think fewer people are studying English at A-level.

Uptake was also down for English literature, from 41,000 to 37,500, while combined English language and literature dropped from 9,000 to 7,600.“We should be very, very concerned at this drop in the study of English,” said the author and former teacher Joanne Harris, whose works included the best-selling novel Chocolat. “This, combined with the loss of so many public libraries, could be the start of a catastrophic decline in the quality of our secondary students, graduates and future colleagues and employees.”The award-winning poet, novelist and teacher Kate Clanchy, who is writer-in-residence at Oxford Spires Academy, where she sees the impact of the reformed GCSEs on pupils, said: “English has just been made less fun. It’s hard to describe just how deeply disastrous it is. English is under pressure in universities as well. We need these people to come through.”This year’s A-level cohort, who will receive their results on Thursday, were the first to sit the new GCSE English qualifications introduced in 2017 as part of the former education secretary Michael Gove’s sweeping qualification changes, which were intended to make exams more rigorous and challenging.Teachers have since expressed concerns that the new GCSE English language exam is focused too heavily on analysis of historical texts, while English literature involves memorising large amounts of content. The changes, they say, have hit the least able the hardest.One assistant headteacher said: “GCSE English language is sucking the joy out of the study of how we communicate: the power and beauty in words. English literature favours those with excellent memories it has reduced our most magnificent pieces of writing to a collection of quotations.”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is right that we should have the highest aspirations for all our students, but this should not equate to turning exams into a joyless slog. We are concerned that the current GCSE specifications are failing to encourage a love of English in young people and this year’s entries at A-level appear to confirm our fears.”Other factors may also be at play, including the government’s drive to increase the uptake of science, technology, engineering and maths – the Stem subjects.“English has always been thought of (quite wrongly) as an ‘easy’ (or even vocationally irrelevant) subject for English native speakers. It’s not,” said Harris. “Falling levels of literacy suggest that its importance in all areas of the curriculum – and indeed, in life – has not been sufficiently emphasised.“It also doesn’t help when politicians make untrue and ill-advised comments about the lack of career opportunities in the arts or indeed when secondary education is constantly portrayed as solely vocational, rather than a means of enriching a person’s life experience.“It is vitally important that the government now pays attention to what teachers have been saying for years: that the way to promote literacy is to make reading enjoyable, instead of using it as a means of returning to a failed agenda of ‘literary tradition’, rote-learning and pointless, demoralising testing.”The writer and poet Michael Rosen, who is the professor of children’s literature at Goldsmiths, University of London, said the new English literature GCSE was more “mechanical” and less about creative interpretation of books. “The student’s own response is not seen as relevant. For some people who before might have thought English was worth a go, they’ve felt that maybe it’s not what they thought English was going to be about,” he said.Dr Rebecca Fisher, the chief executive of the English Association, said: “Without a erse, rich, engaging curriculum at GCSE, more students will be discouraged from pursuing their studies at A-level, but it’s important to acknowledge the other factors, such as the government’s support for Stem subjects at the cost of the arts and humanities, and the misperception of risk associated with studying humanities subjects in a period of economic instability.”The Department for Education insisted English remained one of the most popular subjects: “We are confident that the reformed GCSEs in English are better preparing pupils for further study at A-level.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/622707563b70d32e83241c9fa28bdc86b65b0fc9/0_345_4608_2766/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b6e072e8ade763ccda556a9082bdabf","title":"game birds poland undercover footage","story":"As England’s pheasant egg imports double in three years, campaigners condemn lack of laws regulating rearing and breeding for shooting industryPheasants whose chicks are destined to be shot in the UK are having their septums pierced in order to attach plastic masks to their beaks, according to an undercover film released by activists this week. The method of restraint is illegal in the UK.The video, shot on a farm in Poland, also appears to show the birds being fitted with “breeding aids” and confined in small boxes to repetitively mate. The farm exports ready-to-hatch eggs to the UK for eventual shooting. Animal rights campaigners renewed calls for an end to the “factory farming” of game birds.The shooting industry in the UK has experienced rapid growth in recent years. More than 20m pheasant hatching eggs were imported into England from the European Union last year, more than double the number in 2015.Undercover footage obtained by the Hunt Saboteurs Association (HSA) appears to show how Bazanty pheasants bred at a farm in Klon, central Poland, have their septums pierced to attach plastic masks over their beaks so they cannot peck at each other.Pheasant rearing in the UK is only governed by a code of conduct, as there are no specific laws regulating the breeding and rearing of birds for sporting purposes. The 2009 code of practice states that plastic spectacles fitted to beaks can “cause significant damage” and are illegal under wider animal welfare laws if the birds are pierced through the nasal septum.“Plastic spectacles fitted to the beak to prevent feather pecking or egg eating may cause significant damage to the nasal septum and should not be used except in response to a specific need in consultation with a veterinary surgeon. Any type designed to pierce the nasal septum is illegal in birds,” section 5.6 of the code of conduct reads. However, it is voluntary and does not apply overseas.According to the activists who shot the video in Poland, there are hundreds of raised cages on the farm, each containing eight females and one male confined to a small box. The females were fitted with saddles that protect their backs to keep them productive amid repetitive mating in order to produce eggs. Saddles are not mentioned directly in the code of conduct. Campaigners claim they are considered a management device which is not to be used routinely and should be kept under review. However, the saddles are also sold openly in the UK and are not illegal.The video has been released as the legality of releasing millions of non-native pheasants and partridges into the British countryside every year is under heightened scrutiny, while pheasant shooting was banned on public land in Wales earlier this year. The environmental consequences of grouse-shooting are also being looked at.A spokesman for the Polish pheasant farm told the  that it bred pheasants in “decent conditions” that were compliant with Polish law, adding that “continuous veterinary care” was also provided. “In my business I observe all ethical standards related to the keeping of birds, their feeding, care and treatment,” he said.Campaigners claimed the farm had expanded to meet the growing British demand, and the HSA and the League Against Cruel Sports have called for an end to the breeding of birds later used for sporting purposes in industrialised facilities where birds are kept in cages, which they say make up the majority of game bird farms. They have also called for the abolition of the shooting industry altogether.“Around 43m pheasants are released into the British countryside each year and half of these start off life in factory farms in Europe. All this suffering is just to provide live targets for wealthy shooters to blast out of the sky,” said HSA spokesperson Lee Moon. “It’s cruel.”Nick Weston, head of campaigns at the League, said the importation of intensively farmed game birds and ready-to-hatch eggs from Europe was fuelling the rapid expansion of commercial shoots across the UK.“Millions of partridges and pheasants are shot out of the sky for entertainment every year, only to be thrown into incinerators, buried in pits or fly-tipped by the roadside,” he said. “We are calling for a ban on the import of ‘game’ bird chicks and eggs and we are campaigning to bring an end to the shooting of ‘game’ birds in the name of ‘sport’ across the UK.”The British Game Alliance said it sought to improve animal welfare standards in the game sector and that it was already moving towards effective self-regulation in the UK through audits.“It would breach internal market rules if we were to encourage a boycott of poultry imports from other parts of the EU,” said Thomas Adams, managing director. “We would urge the European Commission to raise game farming standards around the EU to the UK level.”It is understood that Defra is exploring how to strengthen the regulatory system, but a spokesperson said the government was proud the UK had some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world.The department was asked what resulted from a 2012 Defra study that set out to determine whether cage-based breeding could “meet the needs of game birds” – after the industry itself raised concerns that the practice was incompatible with its ethical values. It did not provide a direct response.“The Animal Welfare Act 2006 already makes it clear that no animal should suffer unnecessarily,” Defra said. “In England, the legislation is backed up by a statutory Code of Practice, meaning those mistreating game birds and not complying with the law and the code can face prosecution.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/877d572c4020666e4174ecd72503bccadaf0cec8/0_0_1955_1173/master/1955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e06e33f8780aff7633eaede83e874c3c","title":"what the stars can teach us about travelling in style","story":"Mia Farrow opted for a kaftan while Marilyn Monroe went for high heels. What can vintage celebrity fashion tell us about cool, comfortable travel?Air travel was nothing if not a photo opportunity for Marilyn Monroe, one of Hollywood’s first jet-setters. A tiny clutch bag suggests a seat in first class (no lugging a jumper and snacks around), while carrying a book about a former president implies an aspirational approach to in-flight entertainment. Ever checked your step-count after a day in the air? You may have crossed oceans, but you’ll walk mere metres – meaning white stilettos aren’t as impractical as they may at first appear.Style tip: Dress for the flight you want, not the flight you are booked on. Leah HarperCirca 1968 – post-Rosemary’s Baby, pre-The Great Gatsby – Mia Farrow stepped off a plane in London wearing an embroidered, full-length kaftan, promptly redefining the style rules of long-haul travel. The actor had just returned from two months of transcendental meditation in India – where she presumably picked this piece up – and the relaxed lines of her diaphanous gown clearly reflected her mood. Until then, Farrow had been the poster girl for baby-doll dresses, thigh-skimming hemlines and Peter Pan collars. This arrival-hall look at Heathrow heralded the start of a new sartorial era for the star, not to mention a lesson in how to fuse comfort and style.Style tip: This is a hard-working holiday outfit: a roomy kaftan or a maxidress is a perfect beach cover-up, nightie or comfy airport option. Scarlett ConlonDavid Bowie, seen here at London Victoria train station in 1973, just a few days after he hung up his platforms as Ziggy Stardust, had the right idea when it came to what to wear on the Great British rail network. A chameleon of style, his sartorial prowess clearly stretched to travel dressing with layers preparing him for window drafts, as well as overzealous air-conditioning and heating. His flight jacket would double up nicely as a pillow. But, as was his wont, it is not all sensible: dungarees may be comfortable, but they’re not ideal for a train bathroom.Style tip: Wear a shallot’s worth of layers and take a scarf for a pillow – but opt for an all-in-one only if you have unshakeable faith in the integrity of the electric locking system of train loos. Ellie Violet BramleyThe doyenne of airport chic, Jane Birkin not only pioneered the now-much-imitated all-white look, but established one of the world’s most famous handbags while in transit. The story goes that she was sitting next to the Hermès CEO Jean-Louis Dumas in 1984 when the overhead locker burst open and the contents of her bag fell out. He said he should make her a bag and name it after her. She agreed. The rest is fashion history. When she didn’t have her namesake accessory on the crook of her arm, her airport vessel of choice was at the opposite end of the style spectrum: a fruit basket. Worn with her signature white jeans, blazer and an air of insouciance, the cheap-and-easy accessory went to show that true style is born of attitude, not just altitude, and inspired a million modern-day iterations.Style tip: Opt for a squishy raffia (rather than structured bamboo) basket bag that will squeeze under your seat – no one likes the sound of snapping twigs. SCLos Angeles airport has long been so packed with celebrities that in 2017 a terminal was built for them.

Of his recent work, I loved his Stasi thriller Barbara (2012) but put myself in a minority of one by objecting to a serious plot hole in his hugely admired postwar noir Phoenix (2014) – a plot hole that I couldn’t accept was unimportant, or conversely some anti-realist stylisation. Well, now I have to admit that Petzold has shown himself to have a flair for just this kind of anti-realism or quasi-realism in his new and rather brilliant film, Transit. Its experimental premise was alienating for me at first, but its mysterious, dreamlike quality began to surround me like mist.Petzold has adapted a 1944 novel by the anti-fascist German author Anna Seghers about a fugitive German in Paris who has escaped a concentration camp and flees to Marseille at the time of the Nazi invasion. He has been entrusted with delivering a letter to a renowned author sympathetic to the anti-Nazi resistance, but on discovering that this man is dead, he steals the writer’s identity papers and two visas for him and his estranged wife that would allow them safe passage abroad. Once in Marseille, he passes himself off as this writer, which embroils him in a romantic and political crisis.Petzold has updated the story to the present, but like a Brechtian modern-dress adaptation: it’s a 1940s drama with 21st-century cars and streetscapes and police uniforms. This creates a genuinely disorientating, disturbing effect. What was originally a period suspense drama is now a metaphysical mystery about identity – a dream of something that happened long ago or something yet to come. Franz Rogowski plays the fugitive Franz and Paula Beer plays Marie, the beautiful, enigmatic woman who like everyone else is looking for a way out of there.Of course, it initially resembles Michael Curtiz’s Casablanca, and one actor here, Barbara Auer, playing a woman miserably stranded and stuck with looking after an American’s two dogs in return for some promised future help, does look weirdly like Ingrid Bergman or possibly her daughter, Isabella Rossellini. But then, as the action reveals a weirdly ubiquitous paralysis and obsession with the correct documentation, Transit begins more to feel like Kafka’s The Trial. When Franz tries to check into a hotel, the proprietor will accept only short-term residents, not long-term squatters who will wind up not paying the bill, so Franz must produce transit papers and onward ticket. “So someone can only stay if he can prove he doesn’t want to stay?” asks Franz drolly.Stealing someone’s identity is a dangerous game, and a narcotic fantasy that undermines your sense of the real: and there is another resemblance: Antonioni’s The Passenger. And perhaps in the deep background there is the ghost of Stefan Zweig, the great author who fled Nazi Europe for a melancholy death in Latin America.Petzold finds his eerie leitmotif in Franz’s repeated encounters with the captivatingly elegant Marie who on repeated occasions comes up to him, taps him on the shoulder, appears to flinch and look disappointed or even affronted when he turns around questioningly. Franz is not who she is looking for. Over and over again it happens. Why? Is Franz in a dream, a Groundhog Day of loneliness and wrongness?Franz feels himself in need of an identity that really belongs to someone else – and not just this dead writer’s. Once in Marseille, he makes contact with the wife of a Resistance comrade who died as they made their escape: in fact, he has to break the news, and then he befriends this woman’s lonely, football-mad son. Could he be a dad to this boy? Or is he just stealing someone else’s identity?As it happens, there is a logical explanation for what is happening with Marie – and also a sensational and poignant final twist. This explanation for the dreamlike repeated meetings might have amused Hitchcock or Patricia Highsmith – and that brings me briefly and unimportantly back up against the credibility factor. Just as the identity-theft plot of The Talented Mr Ripley would not really work in the present day when digital technology can track and verify people so easily, so we have to ask if Franz really could pretend to be an author who is reasonably well known, and whose author photo, even in the early 40s, would have been reasonably accessible.But the generic superimposition, the hallucination of the present in the past, makes this a marginal issue. The strangeness of this story will live in your bloodstream like a virus.• Transit is released in the UK on 16 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ad6cb545f5f841b34258bbf3e777032d3ded86/0_234_4160_2496/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ef08920aa853f2d92da4793ddd1f8a4","title":"the joy of six football and the outside of the boot","story":"From Brazilian screamers to an extravagant shank via Peruvian insouciance, we celebrate one of football’s most difficult skillsNB: The point of the Joy of Six is not to rank things, only to enjoy themWhen the Joy of Six was growing up, it cherished one VHS more than any other: the Boys from Brazil. That video, which showed Brazil’s World Cup highlights from 1930-86, is the perfect document of a time when jogo bonito was a mantra rather than a slogan. And though we effused about umpteen bits of skill on that tape, nothing captured the visceral brilliance and sheer fantasy of Brazilian football quite like the screamer with the outside of the foot.We’ve mentioned Nelinho in a previous Joy of Six, so let’s move swiftly on to Éder, the luxury left-winger in that glorious 1982 team. In cricket, those who swing the ball prodigiously are said to make the ball talk. When Éder hit it with the outside of the foot, he made it talk like Brian Blessed. At Wembley in 1981 he sent Ray Clemence the wrong way from outside the area, while his free-kick against Argentina at the 1982 World Cup was so spectacular that he is associated with the goal more than the actual scorer, Zico.That free-kick was revelatory to the rest of the world, but not those familiar with Brazilian domestic football. Éder had been doing it for years. In 1978, he scored a quite ludicrous howitzer for Grêmio against Internacional. His run-up was so long, the cameraman had to sweep to the right just to get him in shot. As he did so, commentator Celestino Valenzeula, familiar with Éder’s prowess from 40 yards, delivered an urgent public service announcement: “Atención.”See also (Brazil department):Verón belongs to a select group of players – Dennis Bergkamp and Ricardo Quaresma are others – who have greater control and range with the outside of the foot than most do with the inside. That allows them to curl it both ways and find angles that are beyond other players, something especially valuable when it comes to opening up a defence.Verón was ultimately a failure at Manchester United but he had his moments, and most were orgasmic through balls. Not unlike Paul Pogba, then. Verón’s best was a devastating pass to set up Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s second goal against Deportivo in 2002. The match is famous for David Beckham adding the word metatarsal to the football lexicon. But it’s Verón’s use of the fifth metatarsal that deserves to be remembered.The longer video shows that Seba treated himself to three preparatory touches, all with the outside of his right foot, before flicking a regal pass that took three defenders out of the game and put Solskjaer through on goal. The ball fizzed along the turf with a trajectory and precision usually seen on the bowling green – except this was played at defence-splitting speed.The most brilliant thing about it is the late curve. The more you watch it, the more mystifying it gets. Had it started to straighten any earlier, it would have been intercepted by Héctor any later and it would have pushed Solskjaer too wide. A crack team of air-traffic controllers, with the ability to freeze time, could not have plotted a better path to goal. Verón had a couple of seconds to work it all out, while a series of shapes moved in his peripheral vision – and had to execute it as well. If you can’t see the greatness in that, youse are all effing idiots.See also (through ball department):No Joy of Six on this subject would be complete without a bit of the old ultraviolence – the long-range shot in open play. This is where the World XI comes to Hackney Marshes where the superior technique required to smack the ball with the outside of the foot is combined with the primal screamer we see at every level.Enzo Scifo didn’t actually score against England at Italia 90, but his spectacular shot that slammed off the inside of the post was one of the tournament’s more eye-widening moments. He scored a superb goal with the outside of his foot against Uruguay earlier in the competition, yet that owed most to precision. The effort against England was hit with thumping force. The technique was immaculate, too, his left arm pointing sideways and his body falling slightly to the left like a broken Subbuteo player as the ball detonated off his right foot.In those days, hardly anyone in the old Barclays League Division 1 dared use the outside of the foot to move the ball two yards, never mind scorch it off the post from 30. The World Cup was a portal to a more exotic place. England won the game – you might remember David Platt’s goal – but Scifo captured the imagination.See also (screamer department):Before Scotland’s first match of the 1978 World Cup, one of the travelling press corps told the goalkeeper Alan Rough to watch out for the free-kicks of Peruvian genius Teófilo Cubillas. Rough approached his manager, Ally MacLeod, to ask if there was anything in particular he should know. “Och, forget him lad,” said MacLeod. “He’s nothing special.”You probably know what happened next. Cubillas scored two superb goals, the second a free-kick, to give Peru a stunning 3-1 win over a Scotland side who had been among the favourites. MacLeod really did stretch the philosophy of focusing on yourself rather than the opposition to breaking point. In his defence, no amount of preparation was likely to have done Rough or Scotland much good. Cubillas could use either side of the foot to go to either side of the goal.Yet even by Cubillas’s standards, this was special – and not just because it was on the grandest stage. Thousands of free-kicks have been scored with the outside of the foot, and thousands have been placed delicately into the net from 20 yards in the McAllisterMata style. But we’re struggling to recall many that have combined the two, as Cubillas did with that delicious, insouciant pass into the top corner.Franz Beckenbauer patented a flicked chip with the outside of the foot. Yet Cubillas’s was even better, not least because the free-kick was a fair way left of centre, the wrong side for an outside-of-the-right-footer. It’s a subtly extraordinary piece of skill, one that should have been named after him – if only anybody was good enough to repeat it.See also (insouciance department):Mick Harford and Zinedine Zidane were not entirely similar footballers, but they had a couple of things in common: decisive application of the forehead, and ingenious improvisation with the outside of the foot. Harford’s goal for Luton against Wimbledon in the 1988 FA Cup semi-final, when he briefly turned into Fred Astaire to deal with an awkward bounce, would have received rave reviews had it been scored by a product of La Masia rather than 6ft 3ins of slumbering menace. (In the same game, Dennis Wise became the first man to score with a two-footed tackle on the ball, but we digress.)And then there’s Zidane’s extravagant shank against Bayern Munich. You half expect it to be accompanied by a few sound effects: a clonk here, a parp there. But this is no piece of Soccer AM gold Zidane intended to bring a touch of the Crucible Theatre to the Olympiastadion. The outside of the foot has always been a useful tool for deception, and by the time the four Bayern defenders in close proximity realised what Zidane was up to, the ball was on its way through to Roberto Carlos.Sir Alex Ferguson once said Zidane “does all his fancy tricks without really hurting you”. He looked a bit silly when, a few days later, Zidane’s unfancy passing helped put United out of Europe, but Ferguson was essentially right. Zidane’s productivity in terms of goals and assists was never that great, and he wasn’t much of a Fantasy Footballer. But, as moments like this remind us, he was one of the great fantasy footballers.See also (improvisation department):The outside of the foot should come with a dignity warning. Most daren’t use it, for fear of mistiming the connection and toebunging the ball into another postcode. That risk is even greater when they are expected to score, which is why one-on-one finishes with the outside of the foot are so rare. They require three of football’s most alluring qualities: confidence, nerve and class.Such goals are, by their very nature, often quite ostentatious think Faustino Asprilla at Anfield. This one, from Teddy Sheringham in a long-forgotten 4-2 win over Newcastle in 1994-95, is slightly different. Sheringham had the image of a flash Cockney off the field, yet on it he was a symbol of understated excellence. This goal is typical Sheringham, a mixture of economy, awareness and technique.When Sheringham was at his best there was, as anyone with a passing memory of Euro 96 will attest, a soft, even sensual quality to his play. He couldn’t run as fast as anyone else, so he did everything in his own time. The faster the game got, the more tranquil he seemed. He played elite football with a resting heart rate.It’s no surprise that the most technical English footballer of modern times loved playing with him. “You should,” said Gary Neville, “have heard Scholesy drool about him.” Scholes would have loved to score a goal like this – one that, like most of the good things that are done with the outside of the foot, demonstrated the relaxed certainty of the superior footballer.See also (one-on-one department):"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97e19930067bd56aae03d932a8639531d1284987/0_240_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3eee57eb823bf249fe5445fdd7cb05e","title":"liverpool v chelsea uefa super cup 2019 live","story":"Liverpool make a few changes to the side that beat Norwich last Friday.

You’ll also notice that the referee is Stephanie Frappert, who’s making history by becoming the first woman to officiate a major men’s European match. She refereed the women’s World Cup final in July and has taken charge of Ligue 1 matches since April.Hello. The news cycle has a habit of moving at dizzying speed in football. Three days after being crushed by Manchester United, Frank Lampard is in Istanbul and has a chance of winning a European trophy in his second match as Chelsea’s new manager. Take that, Jose! In your shiny studio. On that sofa. Doing your punditry up there. It’s Lampard in the dugout now and though he’s faced criticism since Sunday’s defeat it is possible to see what he’s trying to do at a club labouring under a transfer embargo and wounded from the sale of Eden Hazard to Real Madrid. If the youngsters develop then Chelsea could have quite the side on their hands in time.The problem with that theory, though, is that this is a club that doesn’t have the strongest history in the patience department - and another complication is that the competition at the top is growing ever fiercer. Time was when Chelsea sat at the top of the tree in England, competing for titles and largely able to sign whoever they wanted. But this evening they face opponents who are much further along in their development, which feels a strange thing to say given that Chelsea won the league two years ago and Liverpool ... well, we know when Liverpool last won the league.Twenty-nine years ago! But that wait doesn’t sting quite so much at the moment. Not after they ran Manchester City so close last season and went to Madrid to collect their sixth European campaign. They’re clearly moving in the right direction under Jurgen Klopp, even though they had a quiet summer in the market, and are bound to challenge for major honours again. Chelsea, on the other hand, are in a transitional period. Lampard needs time, no matter what happens here, in the first ever Super Cup between two English sides.

Though they were originally used to prepare brides for marriage, to ensure a healthy sex life, the aphrodisiacs are becoming increasingly popular among all women across the country. Recipes are passed down from generation to generation.“All my ingredients are natural. Honey is one of the ingredients. We have spices like cinnamon, cardamom, mustard seeds, chilli peppers, dates and sugarcane. We have some herbs, roots, powders we get in Nigeria, especially around Zamfara, Gusau and Sokoto,” she says. “These herbs have to come in their natural leafy form, so we see what we are buying.”Not only is Kayan Mata becoming a thriving business, it is challenging the taboos around sex and marriage, and women’s role in society.Many northern women are expected to fulfil the conservative roles of wife and mother. “The image we have is not to be sexual tigresses – we are supposed to be demure,” says journalist Fatima Umar. Speaking about sex openly is not expected of women.“At first, I thought this is going to be so controversial because even though we northern women take it, I wasn’t married at the time,” says Mansur, who added her own family recipes to those gathered during her time making up brides, before opening her business. “It was a taboo for someone who isn’t married to be selling Kayan Mata openly. Even when you are married and selling Kayan Mata, there is this stigma that is attached to it.”Umar remembers the backlash she faced after airing a four-part radio programme she produced and presented.“The backlash was from men who said we were being immoral by giving women a platform to talk about sexuality,” she says. In two of the episodes, women talked about being married to a man who didn’t satisfy them. “To hear a Hausa woman in rural Kano say these things – we thought it was ground-breaking journalism, but it became such an issue that I had to switch off my phone because I was getting all sorts of talk that this is an abomination.”Beyond the backlash, Umar is excited and fascinated by the new wave of Kayan Mata and how it is opening conversations around female pleasure within communities and social groups. “Hopefully in the next 10 to 15 years, we will see more open public conversations.”One myth that needs to be debunked is the mysticism around Kayan Mata that compares it to love potions and charms used by women to bewitch husbands or lure them away from their wives.“Kayan Mata is sex food. That’s what I call them,” says Mansu. “You take this food and they make you wet and sweet. That is just their aim, not to make you bewitch your husband. If you are like that in bed and then he enjoys you, if he does any nice thing afterwards, then that is on him.”Social media platforms like Instagram have been crucial to increasing the popularity of these local aphrodisiacs, giving room for more open conversations around sex and pleasure as well as financially empowering many northern women.Although it’s difficult to put a value on the Kayan Mata market, Umar says: “It is definitely empowering women as they are employing people whom they pay well. There are people back home who source the herbs and have been able to get better opportunities for themselves and families because of this boom.”Hauwa Sule Yaro was three years into running her business when her 17-year-old daughter convinced her to open an Instagram page. Within weeks she says orders started flooding in from places like the US, UK, Istanbul, Cyprus and Dubai. However, she explains that coming from a conservative community still means that she isn’t permitted to discuss sex explicitly on her social media.“A lot of people think talking about sex in public is not a good thing in Nigeria. People look at you as someone who is wayward or irresponsible, so people hide a lot when it comes to sex or using aphrodisiac products.”Much of the history around the use of Kayan Mata centres around men as the principal recipients of sexual pleasure, a myth Mansur is keen to bust.“When I started, all the women were like, ‘Give me something that is going to drive my husband crazy! Give me something that he will enjoy.’ And then they say, ‘I don’t care if I have fun, as long as he does.’”As these requests continued, she believed that women needed a change in mindset and decided to teach them about embracing their own sexual pleasure.“I am so proud of myself because now, I have women who actually enjoy having sex. I have women who have had orgasms and climax because a lot of women didn’t know what orgasms were.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7249d976cdd22d8cd0c55633702c1086737d15d/0_161_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eeaf568043bcf5df7a791aa874b9783","title":"joy despair and determination photographs from kibera","story":"Despite its poverty, Kibera is a vibrant place where people survive in testing conditions, both physical and mental.

Why bother holding a regular prime ministerial press conference for Westminster journalists who will ask about tricky subjects if you can select the questions yourself?Why bother trying to influence traditional media outlets by submitting the prime minister to a tough one-on-one interview that could backfire – as Johnson found out during an excruciating encounter with Eddie Mair in 2013 – when you can cut out the middleman and reach the audience directly?And why bother inviting cameras from the BBC or ITV to Downing Street when No 10 officials can frame the camera shot themselves? This way they can portray Johnson exactly as they wish.Johnson’s first Facebook event saw him promising to answer “unpasteurised and unmediated” questions, in a visual style instantly recognisable to people used to watching YouTubers rather than traditional political interviews.Just like an online influencer promoting their personal brand, there was a relentless positivity in Johnson’s responses and no comeback from the people asking the questions. There was certainly no detailed scrutiny of Johnson’s funding figures or ambitious claims.The strategy is being shaped by Chloe Westley, Downing Street’s new digital adviser, a 20-something former Vote Leave campaigner who until recently was at the Taxpayers’ Alliance.Westley – who once praised the far-right anti-Islam activist Anne Marie Waters – has close links to Turning Point UK, the British arm of a pro-Donald Trump youth organisation. She is part of an influx of young Downing Street advisers who are used to fighting their corner on Twitter and know how to create a social media storm by highlighting isive cultural issues in order to “own the libs”.Two months ago she recorded a spoof video for Turning Point UK entitled Shit Champagne Socialists Say, in which the lefties portrayed came out with lines such as “is there wheat in this?”, “honestly this new Spotify playlist is amazing” and “have you finished with your copy of the ?” It provoked a largely negative reaction on Twitter, which after all may have been the intention in a media ecosystem where attention at any cost is considered a success.The live audience for the prime minister’s initial Facebook broadcast was tiny – fewer than 50,000 views in the first half hour – but in an election, boosted by relatively cheap Facebook advertising, such a broadcast could easily reach millions.More importantly, Downing Street is confident that broadcasters and news outlets starved of their own access to politicians will end up using the footage and quotes regardless. If No 10 wants to provoke an argument, it can do so. If it wants to avoid scrutiny, it can equally do so. And it can accuse opposition to such an online-first approach as coming from a jealous anti-Brexit media who wouldn’t give Johnson a fair crack of the whip in any case.Other political campaigners are pushing in-house news creation even further. The lobbying company run by Johnson’s close ally Sir Lynton Crosby has gone as far as to simply create their own purported “news outlets” on Facebook to spread paid-for propaganda on behalf of clients.This strategy won’t work for everyone. It mainly benefits frontrunners who have more to lose from extra scrutiny. But unless the entire media industry refuses to run quotes from this sanitised version of a press conference, Downing Street and other political parties are likely to increasingly pursue this route."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dcbbfe6e46d0639def302c8c79d2da1d1210736/1571_297_2754_1653/master/2754.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb7aa083c4cd7e063fc386c33e2eefaa","title":"labour bloc plans radical move to push through brexit deal","story":"Call for ‘dramatic intervention’ to thwart no-deal Brexit by passing withdrawal agreementLabour MPs opposed to a second referendum are considering a “radical and dramatic intervention” to make clear to Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson they are prepared to vote for a Brexit deal, with one estimating that dozens of colleagues are now ready to back the withdrawal agreement.Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP who coordinates around 30 MPs in a group called Respect the Result, said he believed that passing the withdrawal agreement was the most certain way of stopping the UK crashing out without a deal.Kinnock, who had been urging Corbyn to do a deal with Theresa May in cross-party talks, said there was an increasing feeling among many of his colleagues opposed to a second referendum that passing the withdrawal agreement bill was the best option.Despite Johnson’s refusal to negotiate with the EU unless it drops the backstop, Kinnock said there will come a time in the autumn when a compromise deal can be done based on the withdrawal agreement bill that emerged out of cross-party talks.“We’ve got to make a radical and dramatic intervention,” he said. “If enough of us do then it’s up to Boris Johnson to see where he goes from there. It means a large number of us going to see Jeremy and trying as hard as we possibly can telling him to make that big, bold offer, to face down the second referendum campaign and say there’s no time for that. We’ve got to get this deal over the line.“And by the way, if it is the second referendum that you want then the only way you’re going to get it through a parliamentary route is having the opportunity to debate and vote on it at committee stage.“If that doesn’t work then it’s perhaps a joint statement, a public gesture that says here are the 50 Labour MPs that would vote for this. You need to get 260 of your guys to vote for it and we can get it over the line. Then it’s a question of whether he can deliver it. I think Boris Johnson could lose about 50 of the hardliners. But I think he could gain 50 on our side.”Kinnock said he believed the time for a deal could potentially happen after MPs have tried to block no deal without cast-iron success.A number of Labour MPs have suggested they could now be prepare to back a deal in some circumstances, particularly if faced with the possibility of no deal, including Sarah Champion, Gareth Snell and Melanie Onn. The  reported that John Mann, a Labour MP, was a “go-between” with the government and some of those potentially willing to vote for a withdrawal deal.“I think Boris will present a deal to parliament, roll something in glitter and get themselves over the line and a number of my colleagues would vote for that deal at that point,” one MP said.“Many of them are at a point now where they will take whatever is on the table, a second referendum is so isive and no deal is so damaging.”It is understood at least one Labour MP has consulted the House of Commons clerks about whether a backbencher could table something like an amendment to a motion that endorses the withdrawal agreement, by setting aside the requirement for parliament to agree the deal.It is unclear however, whether Tory MPs would be whipped to accept the previous deal in such circumstances, given how Johnson has railed against “the undemocratic backstop”.Snell, who has abstained or opposed several motions designed to delay Brexit, said he and many other Labour MPs wanted the opportunity to vote for a deal, that he regretted not doing so in the spring and hoped Johnson would present a deal to parliament.However, he said he would be prepared to give efforts to stop no deal a reasonable chance. “I want to stop no deal. My preference is still a deal but no deal would destroy Stoke. So I would grit my teeth and vote for mechanisms to stop no deal, but I want to know what they are working towards,” he said.“People asking us to vote to stop no deal cannot ask us to keep doing it blindly for every madcap scheme.”Snell said he was concerned Johnson would not respect the views or mandate of parliament in the way Theresa May had previously. Government sources have suggested they believe that even if Johnson was compelled to request an extension, there would be no way MPs could force him to do so faithfully.“Yes, you can pass a bill to mandate the PM to ask for an extension to article 50 but you cannot legislate for sincerity, we could compel Boris Johnson to ask for an extension but we cannot stop him making it impossible for the EU to grant one,” Snell said.Some MPs remain sceptical about parliamentary devices designed to delay Brexit in order to prevent no deal. The former Labour MP Ian Austin, who voted for May’s deal and later quit the party over its antisemitism crisis, said MPs would only be delaying facing an inevitable choice.“I voted for a deal because I thought it was the best way of avoiding no deal and because the only result of Theresa May having to leave was a harder Brexit,” Austin said.“This is displacement activity, people can pretend there is a clever procedural device that makes it all go away but in the end, they are going to have to face up to their responsibilities and make a decision. They need to understand that there isn’t some parliamentary device that means they can keep avoiding the question.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5399142a7d615df5fe15afedbf8b3630a6c9bebb/212_53_2505_1503/master/2505.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88d2dd6076de71cef161907f7f5f14da","title":"human sized penguin fossil discovered in new zealand","story":"New species said to have been four times heavier than emperor penguinA giant penguin that stood as tall as a person has been identified from fossil leg bones discovered by an amateur palaeontologist on New Zealand’s South Island.At 1.6 metres and 80kg (12st), the new species, Crossvallia waiparensis, was four times as heavy and 40cm taller than the emperor penguin, the largest living penguin.The penguin joins other oversized but extinct New Zealand birds including the world’s largest parrot, an eagle with a three-metre wing, 3.6 metre-tall moa birds and other giant penguins.Enormous penguins are believed to have rapidly evolved in the Palaeocene epoch – between 66 and 56m years ago – after the dinosaurs disappeared and large marine reptiles also vanished from southern hemisphere waters that were much warmer than today.The giant penguin was identified as new to science by a team from Canterbury Museum in Christchurch and Senckenberg natural history museum in Frankfurt after bones were found by Leigh Love, an amateur palaeontologist, at Waipara.It is the fifth ancient penguin species described from fossils uncovered at Waipara, where a river cuts into a cliff of greensand.According to researchers, the penguin’s leg bones suggest its feet played a greater role in swimming than those of modern penguins.It is not clear why the giant penguins disappeared from the oceans millions of years ago but it may be linked to the arrival of large marine competitors such as seals and toothed whales.The new species is similar to another prehistoric giant penguin, Crossvallia unienwillia, which was identified from a fossilised partial skeleton found in the Cross Valley in Antarctica in 2000.Dr Vanesa De Pietri, a natural history curator at Canterbury Museum, said the discovery of a second giant penguin from the Palaeocene was further evidence of the large size of ancient penguins. “It further reinforces our theory that penguins attained a giant size very early in their evolution,” she said.Dr Paul Scofield, the senior curator of natural history at Canterbury Museum, said finding closely related species in New Zealand and Antarctica showed the connections between the now-separated land masses.He added: “When the Crossvallia species were alive, New Zealand and Antarctica were very different from today – Antarctica was covered in forest and both had much warmer climates.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a64e8aa7258520bc7febbe98e2ac5010b962e1f0/0_125_5550_3329/master/5550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7e46ac194fe3375bdf3cff83f80ffd6","title":"rps 2019 science photographer of the year shortlist","story":"The shortlist for the Royal Photographic Society’s science photographer of the year competition will be exhibited at the Science Museum in London from 7 October until 5 January.

It would cover various items including t-shirts, baseball caps and hats. The trademark would be seen as particularly valuable due to Ohio State’s popular college football team. The Buckeyes have won eight national titles, the last of which came in 2014. The team’s home, Ohio Stadium, has a capacity of 102,082, the seventh largest in the world. The college’s athletic budget comes in at just over $109m a year, and the football team alone is thought to generate income of around $90m per year.

After six hours of rain, play was abandoned for the day at 4.15pm. There was not so much as a coin toss let alone a ball bowled.There was a brief let-up after lunch, a lull between showers, when everyone got out on the field and pretended they had not seen the forecast for the rest of the afternoon. It lasted just long enough for Chris Jordan to present Jofra Archer with his England cap. Then it started raining again. There was a hint, too, for those watching closely, that England plan to stick with Joe Denly rather than pick Sam Curran, who was fielding at slip while the other bowlers got busy warming up.Australia confirmed their own team changes. They have brought in Josh Hazlewood for James Pattinson, which means that Mitchell Starc has been rested again. Justin Langer said it was all to do with their bowling strategy. “He hits a great length, and he’s usually pretty miserly with his economy rate,” Langer said. “That’s what gives him the edge in this game.”If Australia have brought in Hazlewood to try to bore out England’s batsmen, England have brought in Archer to try to blast out Australia’s. But then given Steve Smith’s appetite for batting, they are never going to beat him in a game of patience.Over at the bookies’ tent at the back of the Nursery Ground they were running a special on whether and when England will be able to get Smith out again, with Archer the three-to-one favourite to take his wicket in the first innings. England had not even confirmed that he was playing when they wrote those odds up on the whiteboard. It is a lot to load on to a 24-year-old kid who is playing his first Test after three years of first-class cricket. But no more, perhaps, than Archer expects of himself. The story goes that he was so sure he would make his debut here that he asked the management to arrange for Jordan to be here too.The two of them are best friends. “Apart from receiving my first England cap, this is easily one of my proudest moments,” Jordan told Archer in the huddle. “Every single challenge that’s presented itself to you so far, you’ve found a way of rising to it, and I don’t see Test cricket being any different.“You’ve had a taste in the shorter formats, been in the World Cup, travelled the world in various leagues and dominated, but I know this is the pinnacle for you. One of the first things you said to me when you came over to England was that you wanted to play Test cricket for England, and that time has come. You’ve crossed that line.”Earlier in the afternoon they ran the highlights of the World Cup final on the big screens, and the empty stands echoed with the commentators’ screams and shouts during that wild final over Archer bowled. It was exactly a month ago, and it seems both so long ago and yet no time at all.It is an open secret that the World Cup has taken a lot out of some of the players in this England team, that the turnaround was too quick for the players to be at their best in that first Test. The management are hoping that it will work the other way for Archer, that freshened by a short break he will be coming into this series flush with confidence, in the form of his young life.The highlights were better than anything else there was to watch. Some of the old hands in the crowd beat an early retreat to the St John’s Wood High Street, reckoning, rightly, that the best way to spend the day was to hole up somewhere and have a long lunch. Thousands more milled around the ground, huddled up in the lower tiers, or under umbrellas or the lee of the stands, waiting on announcements over the PA or watching the groundstaff hokey-cokey the covers.There should be more to see on Thursday, at least. This is a four-day Test now, which means the follow-on has been cut to 150 runs but, like Langer said, it should not make too much difference. “There’s plenty of time,” he said. And plenty of intrigue, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0396ab6b6b323231d89146649cf6ab9db9d8f0d3/0_181_3741_2246/master/3741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=476ce8bc23f9af2659d7bb1a7577db5d","title":"england rugby union world cup squad diverse ugo monye","story":"Whenever a World Cup squad is announced it elicits a lot of emotions: joy for those who have been picked, anger for those who have not, excitement for those of us eagerly anticipating the start of the competition – and perhaps a little bit of worry in this case at the risks Eddie Jones has taken. But personally, the overriding emotion I feel at the moment is pride. I’m incredibly proud that these 31 players get to represent our country as the most erse England World Cup squad ever selected.More than a third of the players in the squad are from BAME backgrounds. There are so many different cultures but they are all united by the purpose of representing England. It is a true reflection of modern society and what pleases me most is how it has come about naturally. There has not been any box-ticking or anything like that, this is Eddie’s best 31 on merit.Rugby has always been seen as a white, middle-class sport in England. That was the case when I played the game. I believe it still is. I cannot say it was something that bothered me during my career – that’s the beauty of team sport, you put everything to one side because you’ve got a job to do as part of a team – but I just love the way that things are changing. It has not been forced or manufactured it has just happened organically.Eddie often says to judge him on the World Cup and, of course, he is talking about success in terms of results. But, with the huge increase in exposure, in terms of the number of casual rugby fans tuning in, this incredibly erse World Cup squad can succeed in changing the perception of rugby in this country and I just love that. We’ve seen it with the cricket team, we’ve seen how both the men’s and the women’s football teams have inspired at recent World Cups and I hope Eddie’s squad will do the same with upwards of 10m people watching. Put simply, the more erse the squad is, the more relatable it is to the wider public.Eddie’s remit is simple: to pick the best players, and that is regardless of where they or their parents were born. That goes without saying but I do think Eddie’s own heritage and background helps, as does the fact that he has coached Australia, South Africa and Japan. He’s a well-travelled man with so much experience and he understands different cultures.It is inconceivable a squad will come together and win the World Cup without being totally united and Eddie knows that. You need that shared mindset because team culture is absolutely everything in sport. That starts with the relationships you build with one another.And this squad is not just erse in terms of ethnicity. Look at two of the headline names in the squad – Lewis Ludlam and Ruaridh McConnochie. Both have such inspirational journeys to a World Cup squad. The usual route to international rugby in this country is to start playing the sport at five, go into an academy system at 11, progress through the club, play at all the age groups and then play for England. I’m not sure you can say that about those two because this time last year Ludlam was fighting for a contract at Northampton. The Olympic sevens medallist McConnochie has had more XVs experience at an amateur level than professional. Their selection brings a lot of hope to a lot of people. It makes them so likable, because they’ve had to work so hard.I’d be lying if I said I don’t have concerns about the unknown quantity of some players, simply because we do not know how they will cope in a competition as intense as the World Cup but the last thing I am going to do at this stage is criticise someone or write them off. This will be Eddie’s fourth World Cup and I do believe that, when you combine that with the experience of John Mitchell, it will help to offset the fact that there is not as much experience in some departments of the playing squad.Finally, a word for those players who just missed out. They can go into mourning for a week or two, or even longer if that is what they want to do, but ultimately that will not help. I narrowly missed out in 2011 and, speaking from experience, I would say you have to get yourself ready for if and when that phone call comes. It may never come – it didn’t for me because there wasn’t an injury – but I used the anger at missing out as motivation to prove people wrong. Myself, Chris Robshaw and Danny Care were all overlooked for that tournament but we hit the ground running at the start of the season and ended up as Premiership champions. It can be a driving force if you use the disappointment in the right way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91b5124e0331bba189f20dd32b55b92d980ef0f1/0_198_5114_3068/master/5114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1154149b16802d1f45e652b5a2f0c5b5","title":"simone biles usa gymnastics larry nassar","story":"After the Larry Nassar saga USA Gymnastics should not exist but Biles continues to bring her sport dignity – and moneyOn Sunday night Simone Biles, on her way to securing her sixth US gymnastics title, performed a triple-double in her floor routine, one of two moves she executed during the contest that had never been accomplished before in women’s competition gymnastics. Have you seen it? You honestly have to see it, and then see it again in slow motion. I haven’t spoken to any physicists on the matter but, as someone who watched the move multiple times on my phone while eating a packet of crisps, I can assure you: she defied gravity.Biles finished an astonishing 4.95 points ahead of her nearest competitor but remains markedly perfectionist, even in the hour of historic victory, reflecting: “It wasn’t as good as in some of the trainings.”That she pulled off such feats at all has been hailed as “historic” for her sport that she accomplished them amid the far-from-resolved fallout of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal is somehow even more extraordinary and indicative of the vast extremes of light and shade that have characterised US gymnastics since gymnasts first reported concerns about the team doctor’s behaviour. Extremely belatedly these were acted on and Nassar is now serving life imprisonment. The story remains the biggest court-proven sexual abuse scandal in the history of sport.“I think we’re very good at compartmentalising things,” Biles said at the time of Nassar’s sentencing, in January 2018. But even four days before her astonishing victory last weekend she had wept during a press conference at the competition when discussing the handling of the scandal by the governing body that, even now, she must reluctantly represent.“I don’t mean to cry,” Biles told reporters. “But it’s hard coming here for an organisation having had them fail us so many times. And we had one goal and we’ve done everything that they’ve asked us for, even when we didn’t want to, and they couldn’t do one damn job. You had one job. You literally had one job and you couldn’t protect us.”By way of a recap Nassar was accused of molesting more than 260 athletes under his care (he was also a doctor for Michigan State University). 144 of them testified at his trial, many of them making extraordinary impact statements face-to-face with him in the courtroom. “Little girls don’t stay little for ever,” one declared. “They grow into strong women that return to destroy your world.”Some were unable to testify. Donna Markham spoke on behalf of her daughter Chelsea, who began seeing Nassar after picking up an injury at the age of 10. The abuse that followed precipitated a spiral of despair that ended with Chelsea taking her own life when she was 23.The most widely publicised testimony came from Biles’s former teammate Aly Raisman, who stared down Nassar in the courtroom and declared: “Over those 30 years when survivors came forward, adult after adult – many in positions of authority – protected you, telling each survivor it was OK, that you weren’t abusing them. In fact, many adults had you convince the survivors that they were being dramatic or had been mistaken. This is like being violated all over again.” She declined to speak optimistically about the future. “It’s clear now,” she stated, “that, if we leave it up to these organisations, history is likely to repeat itself.”And yet, to most intents and purposes, the task of rebuilding for the athletes has been left up to those institutions. Despite attempts to take the moral high ground the US Olympic Committee is deeply compromised on the Nassar scandal, with a congressional report a fortnight ago including it in a series of institutions that failed to protect child and young adult athletes from Nassar in a way that was “a cover-up in spirit … whether it was a criminal cover-up remains to be proven”.It is difficult to escape the obvious conclusion: that USA Gymnastics, which failed Biles and so many others so spectacularly, should not really still be standing. Last year the USOC began a push to decertify the body. Yet here we still are, with the expectation, certainly on the part of USAG, that its death sentence will be reprieved. While Michigan State has so far paid out $500m in compensation, none of Nassar’s victims has yet been compensated by USAG. Allegedly to expedite this, USAG has begun bankruptcy proceedings – but these have had the (intended?) effect of staying the executioner’s hand. It cannot be decertified until bankruptcy proceedings have been concluded. At this rate USA Gymnastics will still be running the show for the Tokyo Olympics next year, and perhaps for good.The congressional committee who wrote the report are outraged that declaring bankruptcy could buy USAG almost indefinite time. As one senator puts it: “Bankruptcy proceedings should not impede real accountability for bankrupt morals and leadership. American gymnasts deserve so much more than the inept and ineffective USAG.”But will they get it? For all the leadership churn at USAG – they are currently on their fourth president since allegations surfaced – many senior officials remain in post.In a particular irony, another part of the reason USAG enjoys success is because of Biles, the only gymnast who disclosed abuse by Nassar to be still competing. Double the crowds turned out for the women’s competition than graced the men’s event – record crowds – and they come in large part to see the historically sensational Biles at work. If only she could be permitted to have just one job – instead of both striving to win and having to push for justice against all the adults who did not do theirs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78e40e28109f6ccc3339d227b94a8671d77f4fa2/208_300_3145_1886/master/3145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d33c40c67576b99a0f7ba8d590f7726","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia second test day one live","story":"Who does a washout benefit? Obviously there’s more chance of a draw, with a day lost to rain. Is that to Australia’s advantage, with one fewer match for England to make up the series deficit? Is it to England’s, to nullify a ground where Australian teams have played well for over a century? The wilds of the north will be different. Of course, we’ll have extended hours over the next four days and might well still get a result. But if any more rain comes – and there are bits and pieces forecast – we’ll lose serious time with each delay.Let’s come back tomorrow to see what happens next. Thanks to Rob Smyth for being my comrade in damp, and everyone else for playing along on THE RAIN SHOW! Until next time.“550 tests out of 2355, but how many days commentating?” asks Mark Lewis. “Something statisticians might (struggle to) get their teeth into. How many of the 550 tests were washouts, 3 day drubbings, etc? Where would one begin!?”Good stat from some sentient books.I know, I know... but it’s about the ball, innit? It gets wet and soggy and it doesn’t work. And it’s about the pitch: it gets boggy and then dries and then you need Victor Trumper dancing about to make a match-high 37. And it’s the combination of ball and pitch, because if you thunk a bouncer into the mud it won’t bounce at all, it’ll just stick there in the ot like a strawberry in icing. That’s it folks. We will not get on today after the soaking that the ground has taken. So the traditionalists will get their wish: the Lord’s Test will start on a Thursday after all. Though the iconoclasts will get their wish too: another four-day Test match. That was plenty of time when Ireland visited a few weeks ago, and it might well be plenty of time for us here.Alright then. Bill Frindall’s obituary suggests 377 Tests professionally, and as he took that job at the age of 27, probably had a couple of dozen before that. The Wisden piece below had Richie Benaud’s tally at 486, but that was when the piece was written in the Ashes summer of 2002-03. Richie had another three summers in England and another nine or ten summers in Australia, so you can probably add another 65 or so to that, round it out at 550 or so. Today, if we get on, is Test 2355. So even today Richie would have seen almost a quarter of all Tests ever played.“Isn’t it likely that Bill Frindall saw more Tests than Aggers, CMJ or any other TMS person? He always seemed to be on duty during every session of every match. At least in what remains of my memory.”Good point from Kim Thonger: the scorers do tend to see more cricket than the callers. Andy Zaltzman was at more than 30 World Cup matches this summer, for instance. But I don’t know how much Bill Frindall toured overseas – others can advise. And I don’t know that he did matches other than England’s. Someone like Benaud covered two countries’ seasons every year.“There doesn’t seem to be any mention of the toss having been made. Surely the rain doesn’t need to stop that part of the game, or do the rules say otherwise? It’s not like they would have had a re-toss if it started bucketing down straight after, so the argument that it would affect what the winner would choose seems irrelevant. It would at least give us something to dissect. Am I wrong?”Well... yes, Nick Mills, if I can be so indelicate. You are. You’re not wrong about there being no mention of the toss, because there hasn’t been one. But of course a captain after days of lost time and lots of moisture affecting the conditions might make a different decision at the toss. You can’t ask someone to decide on one day what they might not start doing until four days later. They haven’t even formally named teams yet, because the match hasn’t formally begun.Of course it could start raining straight after a toss, but that would just be bad luck. There has to be a starting point drawn somewhere, even if it’s arbitrary. But likewise there’s no point ruling a start before there has been an opportunity to make that start.Hello, English friends. Hello everyone else too. I can answer one question below about who has seen the most Test cricket: this is Jim Maxwell’s 305th Test match attended in a professional capacity. He may not track these numbers but I do. Throw in perhaps another 20 that he would have watched in Sydney before starting professional work in 1973, and you’ve got a decent number. Scyld Berry though of the  has seen upward of 400 Test matches, and if I remember the story correctly had never missed a Lord’s Test in his lifetime until last year when his daughter’s wedding fell on that weekend. I wonder if it was a test.That’s it from me for now. Geoff will be with you until the inevitable abandonment - bye.Meanwhile, in Port-of-Spain, West Indies are 114-0 after 1o overs against India. And it’s not even a T20 match. (Thanks to Rob Smith for alerting me to that.)“I recall that about five players were given new caps in the England v Ireland ODI in May 2015,” says Paul Chandler. “I don’t think a ball was bowled that day. Certainly not more than a few overs. Not sure if all those players went on to get more caps.”That was Zafar Ansari’s only ODI appearance, but it’s in the book because 18 overs were bowled (though none by him). He also went on to play three Tests. The other debutants in that ODI were Jason Roy, James Vince, Mark Wood and David Willey, whose subsequent exploits need no further descIT ONLY BLOODY WELL CAME HOME! “I remember reading a while back that, before he passed away, Richie probably had a good claim to have watched the most live Test cricket of any human being, ever,” says Neil Stewart. “Richie obviously can’t add to his match tally now, and there must now be some other candidates to nominate. Clive Lloyd seems a good bet, or perhaps Geoffrey Boycott. Jim Maxwell or even Jonathan Agnew. Ranjan Madugalle seems to referee every match I’ve been to. Do you or readers have other nominees?”It’s now pouring down at Lord’s. Plotspoiler: ain’t gonna be no cricket today.“Has any unfortunate ever been given their national cap without ever getting on the field for their country?” asks Sean Clayton. “And would they have to give the cap back if it did happen?”I suspect the answer to both questions is no. The one person who does come to mind is poor Alan Jones.“Was any cricketer as universally loved (particularly in England and Australia) as Richie Benaud?” muses William Charlton. “Did any cricketer do as much both on and off the field? His integrity and impartiality shone like a beacon. Could we not honour his greatness with a statue at one of our Test grounds?”I agree, Benaud was cricket’s best friend. There is a statue of him at the Sydney Cricket Ground I suppose people would say there are English players more deserving of a statue at the Test grounds in this country. I don’t feel strongly either way, I just want a quiet life.“Dear Rob,” says Jason Ali. “I have a query related to Jofra Archer’s debut Test cap. If the entire match was washed out, would his cap truly count?”No, it wouldn’t. The last time that happened in an England Test, I think, was in Guyana in 1990.‘Remember when’ is the lowest form of conversationAll hail the Marmy ArmyI’m sorry to say it’s raining again, and I fear that might be it for today. Heavy rain is forecast for between 3-5pm.If the match does start, the afternoon session with be 3.30-5.10pm, with the evening session from 5.30-7pm.Jofra Archer has been handed his Test cap by Chris Jordan, which is a nice touch.

At first, denial: you watch him shuffle across his stumps and think he’s going to get out LBW every ball. Then anger: you can’t believe this joker is getting so lucky as to play across his pads and never miss it. “Then, as you realise that it’s not luck, it’s skill and technique, you switch to bargaining: I’ll settle for him getting 80 and hope that England take wickets at the other end. Then, and this was particularly the case on the Sunday at Edgbaston, depression: he is never going to get out. I am going to spend the rest of my life watching him bat. I think I’ve got to acceptance, that we’re in the presence of an all-time great and we might as well enjoy it. But this might change if he’s 150* on Saturday morning.” “Inspection by Leftfield?” muses James Debens. “That’s bare lame from the insomniac’s boyfriend, Boris Starling, my superannuated amigo. All we hep daddios are grooving to the Balearic beatz of Introspection by MGMT, only the band that Can could have been. Introspection was a cover of a deeply obscure psychedelic cut by Faine Jane. As in the Edge is faine...”“Good to see we are still in with a shout in this Test,” says Ian Copestake. “Loved your Joy of Six, sir. Go on, give it a plug!”Oh go on then.“Afternoon Rob,” says Matt Emerson. “The article on GD McGrath had me scuttling off to Statsguru. Here’s the list of the England batsmen who had the best average when McGrath was playing for Australia (min 5 matches). No surprise to see KP highest – his average is actually under 40 when McGrath isn’t in the side. Cook’s average of 27.60 v 42.63 when McGrath wasn’t playing is an interesting counterpoint...”I’d be loath to read too much into that Cook stat, simply because he only played one series against McGrath. Mind you, I’d love to see head-to-head data from the 1980s and 1990s. I remember producing some statistical F.U.N. before the 2002-03 Ashes, and found that Ponting averaged something like 160 against Caddick and 20 against Gough. Gough was then ruled out of the series and Ponting hammered centuries in the first two Tests, but it’s the thought that counts.“How’s the panel going?” says Emma John. “I’m doing one on the best country music alter egos… it’s pretty niche. But it did introduce me to Lester ‘Roadhog’ Moran and the Cadillac Cowboys.”When you say pretty niche. As for Smith, I’ve cracked the case - all we need is a flux capacitor and Chris Tremlett.“Dear Rob,” says Boris Starling. “Whenever I see the word ‘inspection’ in an OBO, I think of this (frankly epic) Leftfield track.”You and nones of others, I suspect. Great song, though. They’ve done some rare old corkers. Snake Blood, which I think was done for the film The Beach, is my favourite.The umpires will inspect against at 2.30pm. They are worried about a few damp patches on the outfield.The umpires are inspecting at their leisure. If it stays dry I suspect play will start around 3pm, but there have been smaller ifs. “How to get Smith out?” muses Matt Dony. “Hmmm. If there’s one thing I know about Australians, it’s that they flipping love You’re The Voice by John Farnham. Regular blasts of that through the PA, then when he starts joining in with the ‘Whooohooohooooaah’ bits in closed-eyed rapture, send Archer in to demolish the stumps. I’m not one for the moral high ground.”“Archer is the key to dismissing Steve Smith,” says Ian Batch. “The fact he bowls so close to the stumps (bowlers end) and fast, means that Smith’s trigger movement across the stumps will make him more susceptible to LBW because he can’t get outside the line of off stump like he can to those that deliver from wider on the crease. “Archer should also bowl a knuckle ball an over with a catching cover and midwicket in place so that any mistimed shot can be taken – similar to Maxwell’s dismissal in the WC semi-final when he was through his shot early and completely deceived. The faster you bowl, the harder it is to detect the slower ball, so ideally one after a very slippery bouncer would be my instruction.” Smith averages 92 in Tests when facing 90mph+ deliveries, you know. That said, Archer is different for the reasons you state. The fact he gets so close to the stumps will be a problem for their left-handers as well.“Rob,” says Bob O’Hara. “Does the apocalyptic forecast for later just mean that England will be batting first?” Inspection at 2pm!It has stopped raining and the covers are coming off, though the forecast for later is apocalyptic. Don’t get your hopes up.Have you listened to this week’s Spin podcast? If not, do so at your earliest convenience - it’s a gem.“There doesn’t seem to be any mention of the toss,” says Nick Mills. “Surely the rain doesn’t need to stop that part of the game, or do the rules say otherwise? It’s not like they would have had a re-toss if it started bucketing down straight after the toss had been held, so the argument that it would affect what the winner of the toss would choose seems irrelevant. It would at least give us something to dissect. Am I wrong?”You are. They only toss up when they have a scheduled start time. That seems fair to me, because the captain who wins the toss deserves to have a vague idea of the conditions in which the game will start. Also, both teams need to name their final XI at the toss. If England had to pick a team today, they might choose Curran over Leach. If the game doesn’t start until tomorrow, and the sun shines as expected, they’d be much more likely to choose Leach.Nobody does nostalgia as well as Scott Oliver, and this is a masterful piece on the man who shattered a million English dreams.Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Nothing much to report, so I’m going to proceed with a panel on how the flip England can dismiss Steve Smith. If anyone changes at Lord’s, you’ll hear it here fourth.“Here in Somerset, whence London’s weather comes, it’s not exactly sunny, but it’s no longer raining, and with a drying breeze. I’ve already been outside to check whether the Husqvarna can go on yet, with a further inspection due at 1.30.

Wonder how that will turn out?”“I thought that ‘not clever’ was an example of litotes, but it’s been a very long time since I studied grammar and am probably mistaken,” writes Ben Powell. Aside from litotes sounding like things that grow on your tonsils, that’s true, it is a positive expressed by the negative. My thought is just that the adjective doesn’t match because cleverness is an attribute of a sentient being acting deliberately, not a fortunate turn of events. Good and clever are not synonyms, even if cleverness is generally good.“I think cricket’s use of language adds to the charm,” writes Dave Adams. “I love the Australian use of ‘ordinary’, which is similar to when you hear commentators say a batsman averaging 7.9 in a series is ‘pretty moderate’ when they actually mean ‘dismal’, ‘shocking’, or just ‘shit’. There’s a fine line between cowardly and diplomatic, and I guess it’s difficult to be too harsh on a player as a journalist if you’re reliant on them being willing to give you an interview at some point. By the way - forecast says it’s going to stop raining (properly this time) in 53 minutes...”I’ll believe it when I see it.“I used to have a knack of coming to Ashes Tests on wet days,” writes Tim Sanders. “The Friday at Lords in 1977 was the last rain in England for 3 months. The Sunday at Headingley in 2001 had just enough play to avoid refunds, and led to Gilchrist’s bold declaration. The Saturday at Old Trafford in 2005 gave me a treasured memory of my late father-in-law, as he sat alone in the stand attempting the crossword as the Yorkshire Post turned to papier mâché in his hands.  “So when my son and I made our way to Trent Bridge on a cloudy Thursday morning in 2015, I was pessimistic. However, that day turned out OK for most of those present. I’m convinced that it was Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow’s batting that made the sun come out that afternoon.”“I can’t wait to see how you keep yourself entertained over four days of rain at Old Trafford.

I was worried because I’ve been bored all summer and Twitter passes the time for me.”The user was worried about losing her “mutuals” – accounts she follows that follow her back – and devised other ways to get tweets out. Her self-described “fan account” is used primarily to send tweets about Ariana Grande.Dorothy then sent a tweet saying: “my mom took my phone and my nintendo ds so i have no choice but to use my wii … thank u all for the support and love.” The tweet’s source label, which indicates the device from which a tweet was sent, confirmed that the tweet came from a Wii U.Finally, after her mother apparently took her Wii U away as well, she sent a tweet from her LG Smart refrigerator: “I’m talking to my fridge what the heck,” she said.LG did not respond to request for comment, but its website confirms the refrigerator does have social media capabilities, and the tweet source confirms it was sent from the device.After the saga went viral, with more than 12,000 retweets, Twitter itself stepped in and joined the calls for Dorothy to be returned to the internet, tweeting “#FreeDorothy”.Dorothy did not answer questions regarding how long she will be grounded. “I may be late to reply, as it is difficult to find something to use Twitter,” she told the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/833edc16435de60d406f1a7367fc5f25b02be4c9/0_205_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eec257a2b3ea255833e8a11875b9221","title":"mix it up the mixologists guide to drinking rum","story":"Still drinking gin? Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

Now, with the help of Tiffany Haddish, a new Netflix show is bigging up black voices at lastIn 2017, Tiffany Haddish, the breakout star of Girls Trip, told the  that she has never wanted to “steal the show”. “I’m not a thief. Where I come from, you don’t call someone that.”This week, Haddish is going to practise what she preaches, handing the mic over to six comedians she thinks deserve our time. The stars subvert the male, pale and stale status quo: they are mainly women of colour, and also represent queer, trans and working-class identities. The show undoubtedly breaks new ground in representation in comedy.Haddish, who turned her hand to the art of laughter when she went into foster care aged 12, has described her candid style of comedy as a “safe space” to discuss adversity. She lived in her car while trying to land work in her 20s, then shot to fame after giving it her all in Girls Trip. Now, They Ready on Netflix will pass the baton to other comedians who have been sidelined by history.The show also fits into a rapidly changing comedy climate, which is more erse than it ever has been. In 2011, Shappi Khorsandi joked that she was probably the “only female Iranian comedian” – but since then, dozens more women of colour have sprung on to the scene and become household names. HBO’s Insecure blew the stage wide open for black women comics in 2016, while women of colour-fronted podcasts such as 2 Dope Queens have become mainstays of the morning commute, and standups such as Ali Wong have seen their shows go stratospheric on Netflix. But what is responsible for the boom? Historically, comedy has always been a boys’ club in which women of colour have faced lazy stereotyping and struggled to demonstrate demand for their work to white bookers. So what has sparked the change?On the come-up, the biggest issue for Tracey Ashley, one of They Ready’s comedians, was stereotyping. When she was first scouted by Louis Lee of Acme comedy club, she says Lee told her: “You’re star quality, but it’s going to be hard. You don’t fit the stereotype of what a black female comedian should be.” He was right. “Everywhere I went, people thought I was gonna get on stage, shuck and jive, and be loud,” says Ashley.Meanwhile, both Chaunté Wayans and Flame Monroe, who will also take to Haddish’s stage on Netflix, say that being LGBT+ presented additional challenges on the comedy scene. As a self-described lesbian stud, Wayans says people often tried to make her into something she wasn’t. “People would ask me to show my breasts more, to look the way I felt the most uncomfortable. I was like: ‘I’m funny! You haven’t even seen my set yet!’”Monroe adds that being black and trans, it was common to be outright ignored. “I worked in comedy for 10 years before men – some women as well – would even acknowledge me in the green room,” she says.The presence of black women specifically was also highly controlled by the bookers. Ashley says: “You could go to a club and look at their calendar for the year, you wouldn’t see two women of colour ... they kept us separate.”In the UK, the British and African-Indian standup Athena Kugblenu has run into the same problems. “I still never see the other black women on the circuit, because people won’t book more than one black woman a night.”“The biggest challenge is still getting people to see us as iniduals, not a genre. ‘Black female’ is not a genre of comedy.”That’s not to say comedians themselves don’t fall into the trap of feeling that race is their only selling point. The Afro-Latinx comedian Aida Rodriguez, who also stars in They Ready, thinks this mindset used to influence lots of performers of colour. “When I started doing standup there was a lot more ide and conquer,” she says. “This idea that there can only be one person of colour at the top – even though the Seinfelds, the Louis CKs, the Jim Gaffigans and the Jay Lenos didn’t have to operate like that.”Ashley echoes this: “When I was coming up on the road by myself, they would pit women against each other. I would tell other women: ‘Y’all realise if we come together, we can do some groundbreaking things?’”Over time, a strong culture of solidarity has built up, which has played a big part in the industry shakeup. The premise of They Ready is Haddish using her platform to spotlight other marginalised comedians – but this tradition has a history.Rodriguez met Haddish five years ago at a standup competition: “She came up to me and said: ‘I’ve heard about you, now I see why. You’re so pretty, and I want to be your friend.’ It was just like being on the playground when you’re five. It was that pure, and that sweet.”From giving her tips (such as stop offering your labour for free) to FaceTiming her on dark Chicago walks home to make sure she stayed safe, Haddish helped Rodriguez out however she could. “She would call me in the mornings when I was taking my babies to school and give me a word of encouragement, because she knew I would be tired.”The two made a pact “that whoever made it first would throw the rope back – and she made it first.”Ashley agrees that getting gigs is still mainly about who you know, which makes it all the more important for women of colour to help each other up when they find success. “Friends get people in – recommendations and stamps of approval,” she says.She remembers what Viola Davis said when she won her Emmy in 2015: “The only thing that separates women of colour from anyone else is opportunity.”Like most creative industries, much of the change in the comedy landscape undoubtedly has to do with the internet. Pointing to social media comics such as Judy Love, Kugblenu says: “Once you prove you’ve got that online audience, that’s when the mainstream starts to pay attention. At that point you’re undeniable – people can’t make excuses about what you do being ‘niche’.”The internet allowed women to create comedy in spaces they could control. Kugblenu says that when she was starting out, most open-mics would take place in pubs and bars, which felt alienating. “They’re very white, male spaces.”Like Judy Love, Chescaleigh Ramsey found an audience on YouTube, publishing homemade listicle-style skit videos. In a similar vein, podcasts such as 2 Dope Queens and the spinoff Sooo Many White Guys landed their stars an HBO special.For many, Insecure, Issa Rae’s hit web series-turned-TV show, was a turning point for television. Ashley says: “When that show came out, I was so excited. Issa Rae found her lane online.”Regardless of budget, as views, clicks and downloads racked up for women of colour online, it became obvious there was a huge appetite for it. Ashley jokes: “I finally get here, and now they’re just laying it all out. There are women of colour all over television – who just popped out.”For women of colour, it seems the scene has changed unrecognisably. As well as networking more widely – with people of colour collectives such as FOC It Up coming together – more women of colour getting recognised means more ersity in how they are portrayed in comedy. “In the past it was all stereotypes,” says Rodriguez. “But now people are speaking about politics, social issues. It’s not just comedians going on stage and giving people what they’re accustomed to seeing.”And the more representation there is, the easier it is for others starting out. Monroe points to the prominence of other black trans people like her in the media: “With women like Laverne Cox and Janet Mock, it has helped. Hopefully I’ve kicked the doors open for transgender comedians coming behind me, so now they don’t have to show up and make excuses for who they are all they have to do is show up and be funny.”The natural next step, it seems, is for those in positions of power to give a platform to others who struggle to get on the scene – whether that’s due to racism, classism, homophobia or transphobia. Ashley agrees: “I’m hoping that what Tiffany did will open the eyes of a lot of people, because that’s what you’re supposed to do. This is the only way to move us all forward.”Nonetheless, she already believes things have changed for good. “For a long time, we all wanted to be in the boys’ club,” she says. “That was the only place there was. But now, that’s been obliterated. That is gone now.”• They Ready is on Netflix now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ded851e5f5767713e7a77399c78b3dec394cafd/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe0d5ffa8f6faa8d0e8546b16f4e5637","title":"stacey abrams voter suppression campaign states","story":"As of 2018, 10 states – all with Republican-controlled legislatures – have strict voter ID laws in placeThe former lawmaker Stacey Abrams – who energized Democrats in Georgia with her near-miss run for Senate there – said this week that she would not enter the Democrats’ race to be the party’s 2020 candidate.Instead she will be focussing on a new multi-million initiative aiming to protect voters in battleground states around the country, although she added she is open to being a running mate in a presidential bid.Abrams, who accused her ultimately successful Republican opponent Brian Kemp of voter suppression in Georgia’s Senate race last year, launched the Fair Fight 2020 campaign, saying: “There are only two things stopping us in 2020: making sure people have a reason to vote and that they have the right to vote.”Andrew Gillum, a former gubernatorial candidate for the Democrats in Florida, similarly earlier this year launched a big voter mobilization campaign in the crucial state, Bring it Home Florida.But what is the size of the challenge to tackle voter suppression?At least 17 million voters were purged nationwide between 2016 and 2018, according to a recent study by the Brennan Center for Justice.Research has shown that strict voter identification laws suppress voter turnout and favor Republican candidates. As of 2018, 10 states – all with Republican-controlled legislatures – have strict voter ID laws in place, meaning voters without acceptable identification must vote on a provisional ballot and also take additional steps after Election Day for it to be counted, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. An additional 10 states request a photo identification for citizens to vote, and 35 states total request some form of voter identification at the ballot box.Restrictive voter ID laws disproportionately affect Native American voters, especially those who live on reservations and do not have standard residential addresses. And states with such laws may not accept tribal IDs as a valid form of identification. Ahead of the 2018 elections, communities in North Dakota mobilized to overcome any hurdles imposed by the state’s voter ID law.The trend has resulted in confusion and long wait times at polling locations on Election Day.This week Donald Trump repeated his warnings of voter fraud – which has long been a Republican talking point, and criticized by many experts as a cover for voter suppression moves by the party.In a piece for the  last year Carol Anderson pointed out: “As the law professor Justin Levitt has documented, between 2000 and 2014, there have only been 31 cases of voter identification fraud out of one billion votes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57790b97ed9a02407b87dae632dfdb39b73a21ef/329_202_4088_2453/master/4088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60b5a9f24973370fd0bba2d833958f23","title":"first cracks appear in matteo salvinis charge to be italys pm","story":"Former coalition partner M5S and opposition could unite to scupper far-right leader’s plansThis time last week the Italian far-right leader, Matteo Salvini, seemed invincible. His League party had managed to push the latest version of its draconian anti-immigration bill through parliament after winning a vote of no-confidence. The party then claimed victory after its coalition partner, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), failed to block an Alpine rail link with France.Italians have been squabbling over the TAV rail project for 30 years, but for Salvini the clash was the ideal catalyst for liberating his party from the tempestuous coalition. Seeking to capitalise on the League’s flourishing popularity, he called for snap elections and immediately declared himself a candidate for prime minister, urging supporters in the coastal town of Pescara to give the League “the strength to take this country in hand and save it”.“Italians need certainty and a government that does things, not a Mr No,” he said after announcing last Thursday that he was pulling the plug on the coalition. It was pointless carrying on because of all the quarrelling, he said.Just under a week later, Salvini’s path to the premiership looks less than smooth after the League’s attempts to call an immediate no-confidence vote in the current leader, Giuseppe Conte, were thwarted on Tuesday by M5S and the centre-left Democratic party (PD). Conte has been summoned to parliament on 20 August to address the crisis and face a possible confidence vote then, but the outcome is uncertain.Salvini’s political ascent has been aided by his relentless campaigning on social media and rallies on piazzas and beaches across the country with what he presents as a “man of the people” style. His demonising of a succession of so-called enemies – migrants, Roma people, Muslims, leftwing “do-gooders” – has also been a reliable component of his success.Demographics played a key role in his EU election campaign as part of his nativist vision of reversing Italy’s shrinking population and protecting Italian identity. He regularly kisses crucifixes and thanks the Virgin Mary for his successes, while attacking Pope Francis. All of this has appealed to a support base yearning for a strongman to restore pride in Italy.Now though, the emerging relationship between former rivals M5S and the PD could jeopardise Salvini’s plans. Spearheaded by the former prime minister and PD senator, Matteo Renzi, factions from each party have been in talks about carving out a majority in parliament that could see the government through to the end of its term in 2023. The PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti, opposed the suggestion earlier this week but is now warming to it. Recognising the threat, Salvini made another surprise move during the heated senate debate on Tuesday by saying he would be willing to accept a proposal by the M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, to cut the number parliamentarians from 951 to 605 – on condition the reform was swiftly followed by new elections.“It’s a very cheap tactical game toward M5S and a way to bide time while Salvini invents a new line of communication to maintain his popularity,” said Mattia Diletti, a politics professor at Rome’s Sapienza University.Salvini’s moves to revive a coalition with Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and the smaller far-right party, Brothers of Italy, also hit a stumbling block after Forza Italia said it would not contest new elections on a single electoral list or scrap its party symbol. Berlusconi could easily shift his support to the opposition if he is not granted status within the coalition.Salvini has also faced protests on his beach tour to woo supporters in M5S’s southern strongholds. “It’s not only the traditional southern leftwingers opposing him, but M5S supporters who are calling him ‘traitor’,” said Diletti."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9ccc7bdafc13a3aed262e1c9cd87940d612dca/0_110_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86e2f2789a3bdb663ea0091aa31721dd","title":"satellite photos show chinese armoured vehicles border hong kong shenzhen sports stadium","story":"Paramilitary police personnel carriers appear to be parked in Shenzhen sports stadiumSatellite photos show what appear to be armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles belonging to the China’s paramilitary People’s Armed police parked in a sports stadium in the city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, which some have interpreted as Beijing threatening increased force against pro-democracy protesters.The pictures collected on Monday by Maxar’s WorldView show more than 100 vehicles sitting on and around the soccer stadium at the Shenzhen Bay sports centre just across the harbour from the Asian financial hub that has been rocked by more than two months of near-daily street demonstrations.Flights at Hong Kong’s airport, one of the world’s busiest, were disrupted on Monday and Tuesday by a mass demonstration and occasional violence inside its terminal.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world\u0027s most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene.\u0026nbspUnderlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Lam has shown no sign of backing down beyond agreeing to suspend the extradition bill, while Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city\u0027s semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongChinese state media have said only that the Shenzhen exercises had been planned beforehand and were not directly related to the unrest in Hong Kong, although they came shortly after the central government in Beijing said the protests were beginning to show “sprouts of terrorism”.The US president, Donald Trump, tweeted that US intelligence believed that the Chinese government has moved troops to its border with Hong Kong, and that: “Everyone should be calm and safe!”Beijing has been apparently reluctant to send in police or army units from the mainland or to mobilise the People’s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong to quell the unrest. It’s seen as mindful of the devastating effect that would have both on the territory’s reputation as a safe and stable place to invest in, and as indication of the Communist party’s failure to win over the hearts and minds of the city’s 7.3 million residents, 22 years after the former British colony was handed over to China.It would also be a shocking reminder of the PLA’s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations centred on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square 30 years ago, which remains a taboo subject in China but is memorialised with a massive rally and march each year in Hong Kong.Mainland China is believed to have already dispatched officers to fortify the ranks of the Hong Kong police, and may also have planted decoys among the protesters in order to encourage more violent acts that could eventually turn ordinary Hongkongers against the protest movement.Such a change in sentiments does not yet appear to have happened despite rising violence surrounding protests and the shutdown of the city’s usually bustling international airport for two days after it was occupied by demonstrators."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adfc524303df2299f0f5a8eb916f50ab64f02fde/0_36_6092_3655/master/6092.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df42c97eac43fab125a7d3313c44999","title":"trudeau broke ethics law in snc lavalin case watchdog rules","story":"Report describes PM’s ‘flagrant attempts to influence’ Canadian attorney generalCanadian prime minister Justin Trudeau violated the country’s ethics laws when he urged his attorney general not to prosecute an engineering company in a conflict of interest case, a watchdog ruled on Wednesday.According to a bombshell report by Canada’s ethics commissioner, Trudeau engaged in “flagrant attempts to influence” his attorney general and minister of justice, Jody Wilson-Raybould.The ruling marks a major blow to Trudeau’s governing Liberal party less than 10 weeks before a general election. The prime minister and his aides are accused of pressuring Wilson-Raybould to abandon prosecution of Montreal-based construction giant SNC-Lavalin. In the report, independent ethics commissioner Mario Dion said Trudeau and his officials attempted to circumvent, undermine and discredit a decision by federal prosecutors that the firm should face trial on corruption charges.While senior prosecutors sought criminal charges against the company for fraud and bribery in Libya from 2001 to 2011, Trudeau and his team instead lobbied for the deferred prosecution agreement, in essence allowing SNC-Lavalin to pay a fine in lieu of a criminal prosecution, with no ban on bidding for lucrative federal contracts. After Wilson‑Raybould refused to overrule the prosecutor’s decision, she was shuffled out of her role as attorney general and minister of justice.The prime minister has consistently denied any wrong-doing in the affair. Trudeau, who said he was worried about potential job losses should the trial go ahead, admitted he tried to persuade Wilson-Raybould last year to reconsider the decision but insisted he did nothing wrong.Dion disagreed, saying Trudeau had contravened conflict of interest rules forbidding public office holders from trying to improperly further another person’s private interests.“The evidence showed there were many ways in which Mr Trudeau, either directly or through the actions of those under his direction, sought to influence the attorney general,” Dion wrote.“Because SNC-Lavalin overwhelmingly stood to benefit from Ms Wilson-Raybould’s intervention, I have no doubt that the result of Mr Trudeau’s influence would have furthered SNC-Lavalin’s interests. The actions that sought to further these interests were improper,” he said in his decision.“The prime minister, directly and through his senior officials, used various means to exert influence over Ms Wilson‑Raybould. The authority of the prime minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the director of public prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms Wilson‑Raybould as the crown’s chief law officer,” Dion said.In addition to a fall in the polls for Trudeau, there were several other political casualties of the scandal. Trudeau lost his closest advisor, Gerald Butts and expelled Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, both considered rising stars in the party, from the Liberal caucus for their vocal criticism of his handling of the case. Canada’s top civil servant, former privy council clerk Michael Wernick, also resigned. In his report, Dion determined discussions between Trudeau and Wernick over the political fallout of SNC-Lavalin’s prosecution were “improper”.Dion concluded that Trudeau, in his lobbying of Wilson-Raybould, breached a doctrine aiming to discourage improper political interference of the attorney general by the executive.It is not the first time Trudeau has run afoul of the country’s conflict of interest laws. In 2017, then ethics commissioner Mary Dawson found that the prime minister violated the law a year earlier when he took two all-expenses-paid family trips, including a helicopter ride, to a private residence in the Bahamas owned by the Aga Khan. The prime minister has consistently denied any wrongdoing.The scandal, which has been politically costly for the governing Liberals, had largely faded from view in recent months. But Dion’s findings are likely to reinvigorate criticism of Trudeau by political rivals.Charlie Angus, a member of the left-wing New Democratic Party, who joined initial calls for an ethics investigation, called Dion’s report “disturbing” and Trudeau’s actions’s “unacceptable” on Twitter.To blunt Dion’s findings, Trudeau is expected to release a report by former Liberal cabinet member Anne McLellen, on the SNC-Lavalin affair, which the prime minister described earlier as “great”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3985336.1565719872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"80 year old leaving cert student delighted with his results","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnthony Lynam, aged 80, who sat and passed the higher English Leaving Cert paper, with his results.

We seem to know now that a higher range happens every three to four years, but this year it is unique because also there is a one degree rise in temperature over the last 10 years.”Opigo said conditions allowing mosquitoes to thrive will continue until the beginning of September. “We have prepared for a three-month battle because we cannot undo the weather, all we can do is mitigate its impact and make sure people don’t die.”Uganda’s government gave out 26 million free mosquito nets to its population in 2017, but many now have holes or other problems. Opigo said they plan to distribute more early next year.In July, local media reported that the Ugandan government is also establishing an insectarium in a bid to tackle malaria. The insectarium will be used to conduct research on genetically modified mosquitoes.More aggressiveBurundi, a small Great Lakes country to the south of Uganda, is also experiencing unusually high levels of malaria. Almost half of the population is infected, according to the World Health Organisation.Experts say this is also related to climate change, and mosquitoes are becoming more aggressive while reaching higher altitudes.The death toll in Burundi has topped 1,800 since the start of the year – roughly the same number that have died from Ebola in nearby Democratic Republic of the Congo, since the Ebola outbreak began one year ago. Burundian victims included Darcy Irakoze, a six-year-old YouTube star known as Kacaman, who died last week.In 2017 there were an estimated 219 million cases of malaria in 87 countries globally, according to the World Health Organisation. About 435,000 people are estimated to have died from malaria that year alone.Children under five account for the majority of malaria deaths, with Unicef saying 3,000 die every day from the disease."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3986142.1565791681!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democrats need to put their minds to the china question","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Seth Moulton: his “mistake” has been to run on foreign policy above all else. Photograph:  Ethan MillerGetty Images Imagine for a moment that you are Seth Wilbur Moulton. It is no great hardship. Scholars who follow these things rank you in the top decile of US congressional members for bipartisan conduct. You have the patriotic bona fides of a man who gave his best years to the Marine Corps. You have medals of valour that it took an investigative journalist to make public. Cosmic luck gave you an expensive education and the looks of a beau ideal American president from a moreish, if middlebrow, Netflix series. When you run for that office at age 40, all of Washington mumbles: “But of course.”Then something novel happens. You fail. Three months into your candidacy, you are struggling to register in opinion polls or to qualify for televised debates with your fellow Democrats. Many people reading this will be wholly new to your name.The parable of Moulton signifies many things: life’s randomness, his own limitations, the still-early stages of a contest in which he may yet break through. But it also signifies the parochialism of the primary race. Moulton’s “mistake” has been to run on foreign policy above all else. Democrats – electors and candidates alike – prefer to think and talk of other things. Where the outside world does impinge, it is as something to be saved from climate change, or from the Dickensian labour standards of too-free trade.Both causes matter, no doubt. With a millennial-heavy electorate, the Republicans’ insouciance about the first is bad politics as well as bad planet-management. But neither constitutes a geopolitical view. The lack of any such thing marred the recent debates, where Democrats made profuse mention of China, but almost always in the context of trade. You would not have guessed that China is also the most credible usurper of America’s position in the world. Indeed, eight months since the first candidates filed their papers, it is hard to know what any of them would say in response to this: Should it be the business of the US to retard the advance of China? If so, how?Great-power competitionPresident Donald Trump’s answer to both questions is unmistakable. He and those around him believe the US is joined in a great-power competition that his naive predecessors chose to duck. To that end, they are willing to use tariffs and to spend huge sums on the preservation of military supremacy. It is a pointlessly bellicose account of the world and it might overrate the willingness of the American public to endure a generational struggle. But it is an account of the world. What is the Democratic version?The party’s terseness is not as canny as it seems now. Yes, voters are more worried about healthcare than “abroad”. The refusal of the seas to part for Moulton is salutary to observe. But in a general election, a candidate still has to clear a minimum standard of foreign policy seriousness. Trump will spend much of 2020 accusing the Democrats of weakness on China. He has already done it to Joe Biden, who, as vice-president, was putting tariffs on Chinese tyres when Trump was still “firing” people in shiny suits for television ratings. Imagine what he will do to less seasoned Democrats. The more the party skirts the China debate now, the less prepared it will be for the coming barrage.Good answersIt is not as though there are no good answers to the China question. One is that, no, relative power is not a worthwhile concern in itself. The state’s duty is to the wellbeing of the citizenry, not to the abstraction of external greatness. Democrats might ask how American voters benefit from a trade war, or from the augmentation of the armed forces that already account for half of discretionary federal spending.Another answer is that America cannot compete abroad without internal cohesion, and that Trump picks away at this all the time. Yet a third is that, if the US is to vie with China, then it must cultivate the loyalty of third countries through diplomatic attentiveness and economic largesse. For all their belligerence, their revival of the Committee on the Present Danger, the right has an amazingly narrow sense of what the cold war actually entailed. It was a contest for the allegiance of wavering countries, nonaligned countries, loyal-but-vulnerable countries. It was not just a bilateral arms race. Trump’s confrontation with China has never looked less advisable than it has of late. The Democrats are spoilt for alternatives to it. But they cannot expect voters to read their minds. It is true to the point of cliché that US foreign policy has become unpredictable. At fault is not just the volatility of one president. At fault is the reticence of his putative successors. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Fifty years since British troops deployed in Northern Ireland, the border question is as relevant as everTanzanian governor proposes database to catch out cheating menNo trade deal if Good Friday Agreement is undermined, top US Democrat warns BritainNovices banned from Everest after deadliest climbing season in four yearsM\u0026ampS criticised for photoshoot near closed shop, as locals complain the town is only considered \u0026#39good enough\u0026#39 for picturesCitizens Advice accused of \u0026#39propagating racist stereotypes\u0026#39 with training document on working with BAME communitiesThe Crown\u0026#39s Olivia Colman on attempting Queen\u0026#39s accent: \u0026#39Every syllable in every word, you’ve got it wrong\u0026#39Comment: Guinness World Records should reward the weird, wacky and relentlessly committed – not honour dictators\tZimbabwe opposition activists \u0026#39abducted and tortured\u0026#39 ahead of protestsGrant Shapps casts doubt over Heathrow\u0026#39s third runway after he  questions if figures \u0026#39stack up\u0026#39 Family of teenager fatally stabbed by his friend launch legal challenge against \u0026#34unduly lenient\u0026#34 sentenceNew Zealand police admit \u0026#39mistake\u0026#39 in allowing Christchurch to send letter from prisonFossilised remains of adult human-sized penguin found in New ZealandScotland\u0026#39s drug death rate behind stalling of life expectancy figuresNational Gallery to launch \u0026#39immersive Leonardo Da Vinci experience\u0026#39 as they unveil hidden sketch and fingerprintsComment: Brexit in a blaze of no-deal glory would leave the climate, consumers and the Tories worse offDaughter of millionaire entrepreneur found dead in Majorca villa swimming poolPet owners warned about toxic blue-green algae after four dogs die from swimming in contaminated waterChildren burning their school uniform caused Jersey wildfire in \u0026#39end of year prank\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/14/TELEMMGLPICT000190829948_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqiMJbMc1Fn6QpHV6dG3V3Wlu0mTvxd5LGWMJkuI2s6x0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"footballer emiliano sala exposed harmful levels carbon monoxide","story":"The footballer died in a plane crash on January 21The Emiliano Sala plane tragedy may have been caused by the footballer and his pilot breathing deadly levels of carbon monoxide in the cockpit.Toxicology tests on Sala show he had a carbon monoxide saturation of 58 per cent in his blood.Anything over 50 per cent is likely to cause seizure, unconsciousness, heart attack, according to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.The discovery raises new questions over the air-worthiness of the Piper PA-46 Malibu that crashed into the English Channel on Jan 21.Pilot Dave Ibbotson, a part-time gas engineer, was at the controls despite only holding a private licence. Sala and the pilot died as the player completed a £15million transfer to Cardiff City from Nantes.Legal recriminations are ongoing between the clubs. David Henderson, who arranged the flight on behalf of the agent Willie McKay, is currently on bail, having been arrested in June on suspicion of manslaughter.The AAIB said in a statement: Toxicology tests found that the passenger had a high saturation level of COHb (the combination product of carbon monoxide and haemoglobin). It is considered likely that the pilot would also have been exposed to carbon monoxide.A full report on the crash is still pending but Sala\u0027s family demanded investigators  salvage the wreckage of the plane from the English Channel.A detailed examination was necessary in the wake of the carbon monoxide results, a lawyer for the family said.Daniel Machover, of Hickman \u0026amp Rose solicitors, said: “That dangerously high levels of carbon monoxide have been found in Emiliano’s body raises many questions for the family. How he died will be determined at the inquest in due course. The family believe that a detailed technical examination of the plane is necessary.The family and the public need to know how the carbon monoxide was able to enter the cabin. Future air safety rests on knowing as much as possible on this issue.Emiliano’s family call on the AAIB to salvage the wreckage of the plane without further delay.”A previous interim AAIB bulletin on the tragedy confirmed the mystery owner of the plane made no attempts to apply to either American or British authorities for commercial use.Investigators are still establishing whether the doomed flight took place on a cost sharing basis, which does not breach Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) guidelines.The US-registered Piper Malibu N264DB, unlicensed for commercial flying, fell thousands of feet in the space of 20 seconds after making a 180-degree turn, minutes after Ibbotson requested a descent.Wreckage was found on the seabed 30 metres from where final radar readings located it at an altitude of 1,600ft (488m), suggesting it had dropped almost vertically in its final moments, the interim report found.About 15 minutes before the crash took place at 8.16pm on Jan 21, an air traffic controller had asked Ibbotson, a part-time gas engineer, whether he needed to drop further in altitude, apparently to avoid cloud and maintain vision.The pilot replied: Negative, just avoided a patch there, but back on heading five thousand feet.The plane then climbed rapidly to about 2,300 ft before it crashed into the sea breaking into three pieces at around 8.16pm on Jan 21.The aircraft, which was built in 1984, has papers held by a company based in Norfolk, Southern Aircraft Consultancy.Ibbotson, who had previously written on Facebook that he was rusty, had reportedly filled out forms incorrectly before take off. On one, he was said to have written N246DB instead of N264DB.He is also said to have been qualified to fly at night only if conditions were clear without any bad weather.No trade deal if Good Friday Agreement is undermined, top US Democrat warns BritainNovices banned from Everest after deadliest climbing season in four yearsM\u0026ampS criticised for photoshoot near closed shop, as locals complain the town is only considered \u0026#39good enough\u0026#39 for picturesCitizens Advice accused of \u0026#39propagating racist stereotypes\u0026#39 with training document on working with BAME communitiesThe Crown\u0026#39s Olivia Colman on attempting Queen\u0026#39s accent: \u0026#39Every syllable in every word, you’ve got it wrong\u0026#39Comment: Guinness World Records should reward the weird, wacky and relentlessly committed – not honour dictators\tZimbabwe opposition activists \u0026#39abducted and tortured\u0026#39 ahead of protestsGrant Shapps casts doubt over Heathrow\u0026#39s third runway after he  questions if figures \u0026#39stack up\u0026#39 Family of teenager fatally stabbed by his friend launch legal challenge against \u0026#34unduly lenient\u0026#34 sentenceNew Zealand police admit \u0026#39mistake\u0026#39 in allowing Christchurch to send letter from prisonFossilised remains of adult human-sized penguin found in New ZealandScotland\u0026#39s drug death rate behind stalling of life expectancy figuresNational Gallery to launch \u0026#39immersive Leonardo Da Vinci experience\u0026#39 as they unveil hidden sketch and fingerprintsComment: Brexit in a blaze of no-deal glory would leave the climate, consumers and the Tories worse offDaughter of millionaire entrepreneur found dead in Majorca villa swimming poolPet owners warned about toxic blue-green algae after four dogs die from swimming in contaminated waterChildren burning their school uniform caused Jersey wildfire in \u0026#39end of year prank\u0026#39Huntswoman filmed whipping saboteur with her riding crop later died when her horse fell on top of herBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson accuses MPs and EU of collaborating to block BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/14/TELEMMGLPICT000206406622_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZ-9Nu00ZCJ4O3z-g58aHTfgnCuqHE9-bDhFwWbj8w0g.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"national gallery launch immersive leonardo da vinci experience","story":"Leonardo da Vinci, \u2028Virgin of the Rocks: tracing of the lines of underdrawing for the first composition, incorporating information from all technical images\u2028The National Gallery has commissioned the production team behind the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony and blockbuster pop culture exhibitions to bring to life a Leonardo Da Vinci painting, in a new “immersive” exhibition.The painting has been undergoing significant scientific investigation, uncovering the original, hidden sketches of the artist as well as mystery handprints left in the paint. Visitors to the show will be able to see images of the “abandoned composition” below the finished paint work, thanks to macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) maps and infrared and hyperspectral imaging.External company 59 Productions, which has previously worked on the video design of the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games and museum installations such as the V\u0026ampA’s record-breaking David Bowie Is, will bring the exhibition to life for visitors by recreating moving images of the chapel the painting would originally have been hung in. The gallery promises multi-sensory experiences ning four rooms, including projections showing Leonardo’s use of “light and shadow” and a conservator’s studio showing how modern experts can look beneath the painting’s surface. A section of the finished Virgin of the RocksSpeaking of the newly-uncovered original sketched version of The Virgin of the Rocks, a spokesman for the gallery said: In the abandoned composition both figures are positioned higher up, while the angel, facing out, is looking down on the Infant Christ with what appears to be a much tighter embrace. “These new images were found because the drawings were made in a material that contained some zinc, so it could be seen in the macro x-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) maps showing where this chemical element was present, and also through new infrared and hyperspectral imaging.“Why Leonardo abandoned this first composition still remains a mystery.”  Infrared reflectogram mosaic of an earlier sketchOf other discoveries, he added: “Handprints resulting from patting down the priming on the panel to create an even layer of more or less uniform thickness can also be seen, probably the work of an assistant - but perhaps even by Leonardo himself.”Dr Gabriele Finaldi, National Gallery director, said: This exhibition represents a fascinating new venture for the National Gallery, combining the most recent technical research on The Virgin Of The Rocks with an immersive, enveloping experience, giving visitors the opportunity to explore Leonardo da Vinci\u0027s creative process in making this masterpiece. Leonardo: Experience A Masterpiece opens on November 9, and runs until January.No trade deal if Good Friday Agreement is undermined, top US Democrat warns BritainNovices banned from Everest after deadliest climbing season in four yearsM\u0026ampS criticised for photoshoot near closed shop, as locals complain the town is only considered \u0026#39good enough\u0026#39 for picturesCitizens Advice accused of \u0026#39propagating racist stereotypes\u0026#39 with training document on working with BAME communitiesThe Crown\u0026#39s Olivia Colman on attempting Queen\u0026#39s accent: \u0026#39Every syllable in every word, you’ve got it wrong\u0026#39Comment: Guinness World Records should reward the weird, wacky and relentlessly committed – not honour dictators\tZimbabwe opposition activists \u0026#39abducted and tortured\u0026#39 ahead of protestsGrant Shapps casts doubt over Heathrow\u0026#39s third runway after he  questions if figures \u0026#39stack up\u0026#39 Family of teenager fatally stabbed by his friend launch legal challenge against \u0026#34unduly lenient\u0026#34 sentenceNew Zealand police admit \u0026#39mistake\u0026#39 in allowing Christchurch to send letter from prisonFossilised remains of adult human-sized penguin found in New ZealandScotland\u0026#39s drug death rate behind stalling of life expectancy figuresComment: Brexit in a blaze of no-deal glory would leave the climate, consumers and the Tories worse offDaughter of millionaire entrepreneur found dead in Majorca villa swimming poolPet owners warned about toxic blue-green algae after four dogs die from swimming in contaminated waterChildren burning their school uniform caused Jersey wildfire in \u0026#39end of year prank\u0026#39Huntswoman filmed whipping saboteur with her riding crop later died when her horse fell on top of herBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson accuses MPs and EU of collaborating to block BrexitOutrage in France over use of popular cochineal food dye made from crushed insectsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/14/TELEMMGLPICT000206413842_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxE6WYbzRGIq7DYNoS4-zig1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"palm oil bergs begin washing british beaches","story":"These are highly toxic to dogsPalm oil is washing up on beaches across the country in bergs as councils issue warnings about the deadly effect the substance can have on dogs.Dog walkers have been told to remain vigilant and not let their animals lick the white clumps of oil which litter the coast of Norfolk, Wales and Cornwall.Concerned residents in North Norfolk have reported finding the substance on many beaches including Cromer, Sheringham and Sea Palling.Ships are permitted to dump palm oil into the sea if they are at least 12 miles offshore.The lumps of oil, which can weigh up to a quarter of a ton and originate from palm trees, can harbour many germs and diseases.While some travel 3,000 miles across the ocean from the Caribbean, other waste is dumped overboard by cargo ships as they swill out their holds at sea.These wreak environmental havoc, and have been blamed for the death of a gannet in at Pendeen on the Cornish coast.Dog walkers at Fistral in Newquay have been warned not to touch the toxic material. A post on the Fistral Beach Facebook page reads: We have just been informed by the lifeguards that palm oil has been washing up on the beach.This can be very dangerous so please keep a close eye on your dogs when walking them on any beaches.Palm oil is a natural and edible vegetable oil, which is commonly used in food processing and as a raw ingredient. But it can easily become contaminated with fuel waste, bacteria and other toxins.Animal experts warn it is toxic - TV vet Marc Abraham says owners should not let their dogs approach the blobs which are covered in deadly germs.Dogs will pick up anything on the beach, from pebbles, to food to palm oil he warned. These things can cause two-fold problems, the first is gastro, the second is foreign body obstructions.As the palm oil is so gelatinous it can get lodged in the oesophagus and require emergency surgery. Vets Now said It is an edible vegetable oil derived from the pulp of the fruit of African, American and Maripa palms. It is used in processed foods, toiletries and as a biofuel. Large ships also use palm oil as a tank cleaning agent.With dogs, if eaten it can cause sickness, diarrhoea, dehydration and, in extreme cases, pancreatitis. It can also cause blockages in the gut due to its semi-solid state.The British regulator, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it is currently looking into the possibility of negotiating a regional deal to crack down on the dumping of food oils in British waters.The UK had sought an earlier date and is now engaged in discussions with other North Sea States on the practicality, and legality, of implementing these restrictions earlier on a regional basis it said. A Cornwall Council spokesman said they have put up warning signs on many beaches. People should keep away from the substance - if you do come into contact, wash it off using normal soap or shower gel and water and wash your clothes.No trade deal if Good Friday Agreement is

the distinctive glow, allowing astronomers\u0026nbspto understand distant worlds\u0027 life\u0026nbspthrough Earth\u0027s telescopes, they say.The alien worlds might be glowing with spectacular and beautiful colours, the researchers say – a\u0026nbsplight show that could be the result of a process that keeps life on those planets from being destroyed by radiation.The harsh ultraviolet light that is thrown out from red suns was once thought to mean instant death for life on other planets. But scientists say that it could actually be an important clue that allows us to see it: triggering a glow that emanates out into the rest of the universe and is visible from Earth.This is a completely novel way to search for life in the universe, said\u0026nbsplead author Jack\u0026nbspO\u0027Malley-James, a researcher at Cornell\u0027s Carl Sagan Institute.\u0026nbspJust imagine an alien world glowing softly in a powerful telescope.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

Captured by the Hubble Telescope on July 22The sun rises over Earth as captured from the International Space Station on July 15The Namibian port town of Walvis is captured from 262 miles above on the International Space StationThe phenomenon is called biofluorescence\u0026nbspand the glow is formed as protection from the radiation that planets are hit with from their sun, according to the new research.The discoveries are published in the\u0026nbspMonthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and promise a new way of looking for biosignatures – or indications of living things on other planets – that could help us finally discover alien life elsewhere in the universe.Dead planets could be sending signals through space, scientists sayOn Earth, there are some undersea coral that use biofluorescence to render the sun\u0027s harmful ultraviolet radiation into harmless visible wavelengths, creating a beautiful radiance,\u0026nbspsaid co-author Lisa\u0026nbspKaltenegger, associate professor of astronomy and director of the Carl Sagan Institute.\u0026nbspMaybe such life forms can exist on other worlds too, leaving us a telltale sign to spot them.Many of the planets outside of our own solar system are thought to orbit around M-type stars. Those are the most common kinds of stars in the universe, and regularly send out flares that hit the planets that orbit around them.Those flares could be lighting up their planets with beautiful colours, astronomers\u0026nbspsuggest in the new paper. And those beautiful colours could be picked up by new telescopes either on Earth or sent up into space by humanity.When the planets are hit by ultraviolet rays, they can be absorbed into longer and less damaging colours. That process is called\u0026nbspphotoprotective\u0026nbspbiofluorescence, and astronomers might be able to search for evidence of it to look for alien life.Such biofluorescence could expose hidden biospheres on new worlds through their temporary glow, when a flare from a star hits the planet, said Professor\u0026nbspKaltenegger.To study the glow, scientists looked at similarly\u0026nbspfluorescent pigments on Earth, which are commonly found in coral. That allowed them to model the kind of colours that other planets might emit, and allows them to simulate the strength and characteristics of any signal that would be detected on Earth, including whether it would be an indication of life.It could now help astronomers examine planets we already know about, including Proxima b, a planet orbiting around our nearest neighbour star and a potential home for alien life. Researchers hope that could be used as a target to allow us to learn more about it from afar.These biotic kinds of exoplanets are very good targets in our search for exoplanets, and these luminescent wonders are among our best bets for finding life on exoplanets,\u0026nbspO\u0027Malley-James\u0026nbspsaid.Future telescopes could be developed to pick up exactly that glow as it is sent through the universe.It is a great target for the next generation of big telescopes, which can catch enough light from small planets to analyze it for signs of life, like the Extremely Large Telescope in Chile, Kaltenegger said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It promised that those protecting the base would not be able to stop everyone and that participants would be able to see them aliens.After condemnation from US authorities, the event was shut down on Facebook. In response, the man who created it instead suggested that people should come to an event known as Alienstock, a festival where people could together celebrate extraterrestrials on the same date but at a safe distance from Area 51.Now the official website of Rachel, Nevada – the small town near the base that was chosen as a site for the event – has warned people that they could be in danger if they come to visit.It notes that the only services in the area are found at the extraterrestrial-themed\u0026nbspA\u0027Le\u0027Inn, which according to its website has already been booked up by alien fans.

which includes season tickets in southeast England and many off-peak return tickets and peak-time fares around major cities.\u0026nbspThe fares are set to rise by 2.8 per cent next year, in line with the July rate of RPI inflation.Commuters from the new transport secretary’s constituency will pay an extra £84 a year to get to work in London from the start of 2020.\u0026nbspGrant Shapps is MP for Welwyn Hatfield.

Average house prices in London have now been falling over the year each month since March 2018.\u0026nbspAcross the UK, the average house cost £230,292, down from a\u0026nbsppeak of\u0026nbsp£232,000 in August 2018.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA slowdown in China appears to be worsening, which is beginning to have knock-on effects beyond China\u0027s borders.\u0026nbspToday\u0027s figures showing industrial production dropping back to just 4.8 per cent were driven\u0026nbspby manufacturing with\u0026nbspconstruction also appearing to be on shaky ground, writes Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\u0026nbspBeamish says: The July rate is weaker than the financial crisis lows, crushing hopes of a swift economic recovery sown with the bounce in June. \u0026nbspThese data cast doubt on theories that the Chinese authorities will see any appeal in waiting out Mr. Trump in the trade negotiations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEconomists are issuing increasingly dire warnings about the health of the world economy.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s government\u0026nbsphas plenty of fiscal room to turn on the spending taps and pull the country out of contraction but, as ever, will be reluctant to do so, says\u0026nbspSteen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank.\u0026nbspThat means Europe\u0027s biggest economy will take France and Italy with it into a deep European recession he says.More on today\u0027s data showing an unexpectedly sharp rise in inflation:\u0026nbspUK inflation leaps to 2.1 per cent in shock rise\u0026nbspStock markets are tumbling across\u0026nbspEurope after the news that Germany\u0027s economy is in reverse.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s Dax is down 0.76 per cent to 11,660.62France\u0027s CAC 40 down 0.71 per cent to 5,324.75UK\u0027s FTSE100 down 0.31 per cent to 7,227.48\u0026nbspDonald Trump\u0027s decision yesterday to delay tariffs on a host of Chinese imports has not been enough to temper the concerns about a trade war and economic slowdown.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBritain could face a Brussels sprouts shortage at Christmas after a week of heavy rain damaged crops in Lincolnshire.\u0026nbspThe situation is very concerning according to the British Growers Association.\u0026nbspShoppers are already facing a shortage of cauliflowers, cabbages and broccoli after Lincolnshire, a key UK farming region, was deluged with six inches of rain in a week in June.\u0026nbspBritish Growers chief executive Jack Ward says:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor some, a year\u0027s work was destroyed in one week of rains.Crops come in waves but we\u0027re looking at the shortage going on for another two to three weeks, possibly extending to broccoli.\u0026nbspThe rain also affected a lot of young plants so there are likely to be problems into winter across the board with brassicas. \u0026nbspThere\u0027s some way to go but crops that have been waterlogged, like Brussels spouts, it\u0027s not getting them off to the start they need to produce the quantities we would want to see.The pound has risen on the back of higher-than-expected inflation.\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.3 per cent against the dollar to $1.2094 and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.08.\u0026nbspWhat exactly is an inverted yield curve and does it signal a recession is on the way?The general argument is that\u0026nbsptraders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.More answers can be found here:\u0026nbspInverted yield curve: Does the bond market really signal we’re heading for a recession?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYield curves\u0026nbspbriefly inverted in the US too as fears about the impact of a trade war grew, but are now back to normal. Just.\u0026nbsp10-year US Treasuries are now back at 1.654 per cent, a very slightly higher yield than two-year US Treasuries at 1.642 per cent.\u0026nbspThe last few times the curve has inverted, a US recession has followed...\u0026nbspBut the lag has been anything between 10 months and three years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As the Bank of England noted in June, British companies were not the only ones stocking up on components and goods – firms in the EU did the same.\u0026nbspBrexit also threatens the German economy later this year.\u0026nbsp“There may be another boost to German exports to the UK ahead of the next Brexit deadline,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbsp“However, we suspect that any pre-Brexit boost would be smaller than it was in the first quarter and it could prove to be the prelude to a larger hit to external demand towards the end of the year if the UK does actually leave the EU without a deal.”Brexit has already contributed to a 0.2 per cent drop in Britain’s output between April and June, as the original date for the UK’s departure affected annual shutdowns of\u0026nbspcar plants, while uncertainty ahead of the new, October deadline weakened most parts of the economy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

The short answer is: no. But there are still reasons to worry.Gregory\u0026nbspDaco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, points out that there has been a gap of 10 months to three years between the indicator occurring and the previous recessions in the US.But\u0026nbspMarc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, said this instance could be a more ominous portent for the global economy as a whole.“This yield curve inversion in the States really tells us more about the global economy than the\u0026nbspUS economy.“We are looking at Germany, we are looking at, above all, China and we are going, ‘This isn’t good, these are meant to be motors of global trade’.”Data released earlier on Wednesday showed a contraction in German GDP and much weaker growth in China’s industrial production than forecast by economists.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a result, risky assets such as stocks have fallen out of favour and investors have been parking their money in safer government bonds, with treasuries traditionally seen as the safest.As longer-dated treasuries normally provide better returns, they have been particularly popular. But demand has driven prices up and, as yields move in the opposite direction, they have dropped and the curve has inverted.\u0026nbspThe same flip in the yield curve of UK government bonds reflects investors’ concerns about Brexit, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\u0026nbsp“Brexit could be a very drawn-out, protracted drag on the economy in the worst-case scenario,” he said. Because of the risk of no-deal Brexit, investors think the Bank of England will keep interest rates low in the medium and long term to support the economy, and these expectations are pulling down yields on longer-dated gilts, Mr Tombs added.\u0026nbspHe also noted\u0026nbspthat the yield curve has not always been a reliable harbinger of UK recessions.“There were a few times in the mid-2000s when the curve inverted or nearly inverted and yet the economy was still doing OK.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Average house prices in London have now been falling over the year each month since March 2018.\u0026nbspAcross the UK, the average house cost £230,292, down from a\u0026nbsppeak of\u0026nbsp£232,000 in August 2018.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA slowdown in China appears to be worsening, which is beginning to have knock-on effects beyond China\u0027s borders.\u0026nbspToday\u0027s figures showing industrial production dropping back to just 4.8 per cent were driven\u0026nbspby manufacturing with\u0026nbspconstruction also appearing to be on shaky ground, writes Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\u0026nbspBeamish says: The July rate is weaker than the financial crisis lows, crushing hopes of a swift economic recovery sown with the bounce in June. \u0026nbspThese data cast doubt on theories that the Chinese authorities will see any appeal in waiting out Mr. Trump in the trade negotiations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEconomists are issuing increasingly dire warnings about the health of the world economy.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s government\u0026nbsphas plenty of fiscal room to turn on the spending taps and pull the country out of contraction but, as ever, will be reluctant to do so, says\u0026nbspSteen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank.\u0026nbspThat means Europe\u0027s biggest economy will take France and Italy with it into a deep European recession he says.More on today\u0027s data showing an unexpectedly sharp rise in inflation:\u0026nbspUK inflation leaps to 2.1 per cent in shock rise\u0026nbspStock markets are tumbling across\u0026nbspEurope after the news that Germany\u0027s economy is in reverse.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s Dax is down 0.76 per cent to 11,660.62France\u0027s CAC 40 down 0.71 per cent to 5,324.75UK\u0027s FTSE100 down 0.31 per cent to 7,227.48\u0026nbspDonald Trump\u0027s decision yesterday to delay tariffs on a host of Chinese imports has not been enough to temper the concerns about a trade war and economic slowdown.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBritain could face a Brussels sprouts shortage at Christmas after a week of heavy rain damaged crops in Lincolnshire.\u0026nbspThe situation is very concerning according to the British Growers Association.\u0026nbspShoppers are already facing a shortage of cauliflowers, cabbages and broccoli after Lincolnshire, a key UK farming region, was deluged with six inches of rain in a week in June.\u0026nbspBritish Growers chief executive Jack Ward says:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor some, a year\u0027s work was destroyed in one week of rains.Crops come in waves but we\u0027re looking at the shortage going on for another two to three weeks, possibly extending to broccoli.\u0026nbspThe rain also affected a lot of young plants so there are likely to be problems into winter across the board with brassicas. \u0026nbspThere\u0027s some way to go but crops that have been waterlogged, like Brussels spouts, it\u0027s not getting them off to the start they need to produce the quantities we would want to see.The pound has risen on the back of higher-than-expected inflation.\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.3 per cent against the dollar to $1.2094 and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.08.\u0026nbspWhat exactly is an inverted yield curve and does it signal a recession is on the way?The general argument is that\u0026nbsptraders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.More answers can be found here:\u0026nbspInverted yield curve: Does the bond market really signal we’re heading for a recession?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYield curves\u0026nbspbriefly inverted in the US too as fears about the impact of a trade war grew, but are now back to normal.

Before the reforms, universities could use actual results when considering applications.It has been suggested that parents who are more familiar with the university application system could be placing more pressure on teachers to give their children higher predicted grades to secure offers from top universities, leaving pupil from poorer backgrounds at a further disadvantage.The surge in the proportion of university applicants being offered a place on a degree regardless of their exam grades –\u0026nbspknown as unconditional offers – could also disadvantage students as they could become demotivated in their final year of schooling and find the step up to university more difficult.How to get a university course place through Clearing on results dayHowever, radically changing the exam timetable could also leave poorer students in the dark and at a disadvantage, the head of the admissions service argues. \u0026nbspA consultation run by Ucas in 2012 found that an introduction of PQA would significantly disadvantage underrepresented and disabled students unless calendars were changed.Ucas chief, Clare Marchant, believes poorer pupils lacking parental support would have to make quick decisions about degree courses at a time when schools are closed and teachers are absent. \u0026nbspShe also argues that universities could struggle to put in place support services for those who are first in the family to enter higher education, as well as disabled students, in time for start of term.And now that a record number of students are taking up places on degrees through clearing, Ms Marchant argues that there is already a “genuine post-qualifications admissions route” in place.The debate between Ucas and leading groups in the sector rages on. But we will have to wait and see whether the Department for Education and Universities UK decide to finally make a change. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half.

As the Bank of England noted in June, British companies were not the only ones stocking up on components and goods – firms in the EU did the same.\u0026nbspBrexit also threatens the German economy later this year.\u0026nbsp“There may be another boost to German exports to the UK ahead of the next Brexit deadline,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbsp“However, we suspect that any pre-Brexit boost would be smaller than it was in the first quarter and it could prove to be the prelude to a larger hit to external demand towards the end of the year if the UK does actually leave the EU without a deal.”Brexit has already contributed to a 0.2 per cent drop in Britain’s output between April and June, as the original date for the UK’s departure affected annual shutdowns of\u0026nbspcar plants, while uncertainty ahead of the new, October deadline weakened most parts of the economy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened.

The entire cast of dogs appearing in the film were rescued from shelters and adopted by cast and crew upon completion of filming.Theroux and Thompson have been joined by an all-star cast of actors also lending their voices, including Janelle Monae, Ashley Jensen, Benedict Wong and Sam Elliott. Monae has also contributed three original songs to the film, including a far less racist version of the notorious “Siamese Cat Song” from the original movie.Everything we know about Disney+Disney remakes have made over $7 billion since 2010Unlike Disney’s recent live-action or photo-realistic remakes, including Aladdin, The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, the new Lady and the Tramp will only be released on their forthcoming streaming platform Disney+, where it will be available upon the platform’s launch on 12 November.Lady and the Tramp\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspBeauty and the Beast\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is believed to have been one of several species of giant penguins that thrived soon after dinosaurs died out.The findings were published this week in Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.Paul Scofield, a co-author of the paper and senior curator at the Canterbury Museum, said the discovery was significant because the species is similar to another giant penguin found in Antarctica in 2000 and helps show a connection between the two regions during the Paleocene epoch.He said that following the extinction of dinosaurs, marine reptiles and gigantic fish, it seemed there had been an evolutionary opportunity for penguins to thrive and grow in size.Created with Sketch.Penguin habitats threatened by climate change Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gentoo penguins on Ardley Island, Antarctic, where global warming has affected the glaciers that the penguins live on and has brought new species to compete withGentoo penguins on Ardley Island, Antarctic, where global warming has affected the glaciers that the penguins live on and has brought new species to compete withGentoo penguins in Cuverville Island, designated as an Important Bird Island.

Scientists say the lack of predators allowed such birds to thrive.The monster penguin’s bones, from its legs and feet, were found by amateur enthusiast Leigh Love about 18 months ago in the Waipara\u0026nbspriver bed near the South Island city of Christchurch.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When the slower sperm were used, litters were 81 per cent female.\u0026nbspThe X chromosome has many genes while the shorter male Y chromosome has fewer, and this difference in gene expression meant scientists could distinguish between the two.\u0026nbspResearchers, led by Masayuki\u0026nbspShimada\u0026nbspfrom Hiroshima University, believe this technique is likely to be applicable to other mammals.\u0026nbspThe process – which could be simple and cheap to carry out – does not damage the DNA of sperm and could greatly simplify sex selection for IVF or artificial insemination, which is used in livestock, scientists say.Created with Sketch.California Academy of Sciences’ Natural World photography competition Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Black grouse in Tromso, NorwayBrown bear dips for fish in a nature reserve in RussiaMarine iguana grazes off the coast of the Galapagos IslandsWinged carpenter ants walk over the discarded wings of termites, who have left them behind as they look for a mateA trio of polar bears walk by a whale skeleton following a recent, fresher meal in Kaktovic, Alaska611 Winner: Art of NatureSalar de Antofalla, one of the world\u0027s largest salt pans in ArgentinaAndre Bauma, head caretaker at the Senkwekwe Centre for orphaned gorillas, is embraced by one of his orphans Blanket octopus of Anilao, PhilippinesKoala on Kangaroo Island, South AustraliaGemsbok in the Namib-Naukluft Desert, Namibia1111 Winner: Landscapes, Waterscapes and FloraBlack grouse in Tromso, NorwayBrown bear dips for fish in a nature reserve in RussiaMarine iguana grazes off the coast of the Galapagos IslandsWinged carpenter ants walk over the discarded wings of termites, who have left them behind as they look for a mateA trio of polar bears walk by a whale skeleton following a recent, fresher meal in Kaktovic, Alaska611 Winner: Art of NatureSalar de Antofalla, one of the world\u0027s largest salt pans in ArgentinaAndre Bauma, head caretaker at the Senkwekwe Centre for orphaned gorillas, is embraced by one of his orphans Blanket octopus of Anilao, PhilippinesKoala on Kangaroo Island, South AustraliaGemsbok in the Namib-Naukluft Desert, Namibia1111 Winner: Landscapes, Waterscapes and FloraResearchers say they have already used the method to selectively produce male and females in cattle and pigs, although they have not published research on this.\u0026nbspIt is currently illegal in the UK to select the sex of the baby during IVF.

The short answer is: no. But there are still reasons to worry.Gregory\u0026nbspDaco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, points out that there has been a gap of 10 months to three years between the indicator occurring and the previous recessions in the US.But\u0026nbspMarc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, said this instance could be a more ominous portent for the global economy as a whole.“This yield curve inversion in the States really tells us more about the global economy than the\u0026nbspUS economy.“We are looking at Germany, we are looking at, above all, China and we are going, ‘This isn’t good, these are meant to be motors of global trade’.”Data released earlier on Wednesday showed a contraction in German GDP and much weaker growth in China’s industrial production than forecast by economists.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a result, risky assets such as stocks have fallen out of favour and investors have been parking their money in safer government bonds, with treasuries traditionally seen as the safest.As longer-dated treasuries normally provide better returns, they have been particularly popular. But demand has driven prices up and, as yields move in the opposite direction, they have dropped and the curve has inverted.\u0026nbspThe same flip in the yield curve of UK government bonds reflects investors’ concerns about Brexit, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\u0026nbsp“Brexit could be a very drawn-out, protracted drag on the economy in the worst-case scenario,” he said. Because of the risk of no-deal Brexit, investors think the Bank of England will keep interest rates low in the medium and long term to support the economy, and these expectations are pulling down yields on longer-dated gilts, Mr Tombs added.\u0026nbspHe also noted\u0026nbspthat the yield curve has not always been a reliable harbinger of UK recessions.“There were a few times in the mid-2000s when the curve inverted or nearly inverted and yet the economy was still doing OK.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

What they want us to do is deliver on their mandate, come out of the EU on October .However, in early August there was speculation that the new Conservative leader could take the country to the polls in a bid to consolidate his power base.Johnson’s chief strategist Dominic Cummings has suggested the Prime Minister could call a general election after October , evenhe lost a no-confidence motion, allowing for a no-deal Brexit whilst Parliament is dissolved.If a snap election is called, Boris will battle it out to retain his title as PM.It would be a chance for him to understand how confident the British public are in his skills, as his current position as PM was voted for by members of the Conservative Party.A  General Election could see some big changes to the Conservative Party, as it looks like Tories may have to accept the possibility of a No Deal Brexit, and back that in Boris campaign.Johnson would run against Jeremy Corbyn, who lost out to Theresa May in  with  per cent of the UKs vote.However, voices from within and outside the Labour Party are allegedly urging Corbyn to quit as Labour experiences record slumps in polls in the wake of several anti-Semitism scandals.A number of Labour MPs have been rumoured to be gunning to take over from Corbyn in Labours leadership, most notably Londons Mayor Sadiq Khan.Jo Swinson, who took over Lib Dem leadership in July  would also run - Lib Dems currently stand on  per cent in the polls, their strongest result yet.The Scottish National Party , the Democratic Unionist Party , Sinn Fein, Plaid Cymru and Green are also very likely to run.Amid the Brexit drama, its likely that Farages Brexit Party could be contenders after Nigel Farage questioned Boris ability to deliver Brexit.The five MPs from Change UK, formerly The Independent Group, and fronted by Heidi Allen could stand for their new party in their constituencies but risk losing their seats.General Elections have to be held at least every five years in the UK.Previously elections could be called simply by the Prime Minister going to the Queen at any point within five years of the last one.But after the Fixed Term Parliament Act was passed in  the five-year gap was enshrined in law.The act states that General Elections are to be held on the first Thursday in May every five years.However, it has two provisos for the polls opening early.Firstly: A motion of no confidence passed in Her Majesty’s Government by a simple majority and  days elapses without the House passing a confidence motion in any new Government formed.And Secondly: A motion for a General Election is agreed by two thirds of the total number of seats in the Commons including vacant seats .The next General Election in the United Kingdom is scheduled to be held on May , , under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act .The date of the last General Election was June , , which saw the Conservatives lose their majority but remain in Government after they struck a deal with the DUP.The next General Election is scheduled for  - provided Boris Johnson doesnt call a snap election.A snap election could be calledthere is a Remainer revolt against a No Deal Brexit.Labour leader Corbyn has vowed to call a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnsons Government that could trigger an election.If a majority of MPS agree they have no confidence in Johnsons administration, then attempts can be made to form another regime either under Corbyn or a cross-party “government of national unity”.If no viable alternative can be found after  days, a general election is triggered – although Johnson would still get to set the date and could therefore hold the poll after taking the UK out of the EU.Askedhe was preparing to fight an election after losing a confidence vote, the Prime Minister insisted: “No. The answer is no.Britain isnt due a national election until .Theresa May called a shock snap election in  to try and strengthen the Conservatives hold on Parliament, but it backfired when her majority was slashed by  seats."},{"url":null,"title":"uk general election what bookies oods latest","story":"The inscrutable Tory bigwig could be wanting to bring a vote to the people shortly after a No Deal Brexit.

And we should all rejoice in that.DAMNING new statistics reveal the average wait for a non-urgent GP appointment is now more than two weeks.This is simply not good enough.Boris Johnson promised in his first speech as Prime Minister that it was his job to make sure we don’t have to wait for weeks on end to see our doctor.The latest figures highlight the enormity of that task.There is a limit to what can be achieved by under-pressure health service staff and, though the PM has moved quickly to free up extra funding, there will never be an endless supply of money for the NHS, no matter who is in No.What is needed is serious reform and some radical thinking.Jeremy Corbyn will doubtless oppose any new ideas and continue using the NHS as a political football.Butthe Prime Minister can prove as single-minded on the health service as he is proving on Brexit, there is still hope.In spite of teething problems, it’s great to see the right decisions being reached by the video assistant referees — but fans should not be left in the dark while it happens.Refs should be mic’d up, like in rugby, so supporters can hear what’s going on.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There were security checkpoints in every city centre street, bag searches in most shops.In my teenage years, when I attended school in the west of Ulster, one of my fellow pupils was killed in the infamous IRA bomb attack on Lord Mountbatten’s boat off the Irish coast in .Two years later, the terrorist and hunger striker Bobby Sands was briefly my MP before his self-inflicted death, an event that provoked more rioting.Despite the ruthlessness of the IRA, the British security forces never wavered in their duty.Even in the face of mortal danger from petrol bombs, stones and even bullets, the soldiers did not buckle.In the cauldron of historic animosities, stoked by the venom of the IRA, they showed impressive forbearance, undermining the Republican propaganda about British oppression.There were disastrous failures, however, like the loss of discipline at Bloody Sunday in Derry, , when British paratroopers fired on a group of protesters, killing  of them.Over the years, their tenacity gradually wore down the enemy, particularly through the use of sophisticated military intelligence.Towards the end of the s, the entire IRA network was riddled with British agents.Even Frank Scappaticci, the Republicans’ own head of its feared Internal Security Unit – known as the “Nutting Squad” - was alleged to be an informer.Such deep penetration made it almost impossible for the IRA to carry on using the bomb and the bullet effectively .By the close of the Troubles, British security forces were estimated to be foiling two out of every three planned IRA operations.One former IRA man, now a Dublin solicitor, admitted, “It was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.”It was a defeat that heralded a new era in Northern Ireland.In practice, the peace process was a declaration of surrender by the IRA.Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness did not suddenly see the light and become peaceniks.They embraced democratic politics because they recognised that their terror movement, beaten by the British forces, could no longerproperly.After the Good Friday Agreement of , the Republicans agreed to decommission their weapons without achieving any of their key political aims. Northern Ireland remains in the United Kingdom, while the partition of Ireland continues.For political reasons, the British army has never received the credit it deserves for its remarkable victory.In the new climate of co-operation, there is an understandable wish to avoid any triumphalism.But what is reprehensible is the persistent hounding of British veterans who bravely served their country in the Troubles, but are now the subject of official inquiries into past misconduct.No fewer than  of these veterans are said to be currently under investigation, despite endless pledges from politicians about an end to the grotesque witch-hunts.The gross betrayal of their service is bad enough, but even more offensive are the double-standards, for the Good Friday Agreement facilitated the early release of scores of terrorists, as well an amnesty for many on the run.If the peace process is meant to draw a line in the sand about Ulster’s dark past, it should apply to everyone.Thanks in large part to the efforts of the British army, the future should be bright for Northern Ireland.But clouds are gathering, due to suspension of the devolved assembly and concerns about a hard border because of Brexit.The fragility of the situation means that British politicians should tread carefully, respecting the rights of both communities in the province, as well as the interests of Dublin, our closest neighbour.But the Tories have done anything but that.Having thrown away their majority in , they have formed a dubious alliance with the DUP, a reactionary outfit which presents itself as the voice of Ulster but in fact won only  per cent of the vote at the last election.As cheerleaders for unionism, the Conservatives now talk about “our precious union”, while regrettably Boris Johnson has even given himself the additional title of “Minister for the Union.”Whilst many Brits feel passionate about keeping the union together, this rhetoric may not be what Northern Ireland needs.The British Government is meant to be an honest broker rather than a partisan advocate for one side.“Rigorous impartiality” was central to the success of the Good Friday Agreement. For the sake of harmony, that spirit cannot be allowed to disappear.The campaign in Northern Ireland may not have had the glamour of victories like Egypts El Alamein or Waterloo, but it was still one of the British army’s greatest achievements.It would be a tragedypast military determination were to be squandered by present political bungling.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Theyre so rough with them. One person whipping to go into the water and another hanging off the horses neck.Another added: I somewhat feel sorry for horses who have to endure people on their backs whipping them.Others questioned why the police did nothing, with one person saying they were powerless.The programme showed the residents of the quiet Cumbrian town boarding up windows and erecting barriers in preparation for the annual fair - which brings a total of , travellers and visitors into the area.Locals claim aggressive travellers “break every law under the sun” when they arrive for their annual pilgrimage.The programme, which covers the June  fair, captures the rising tension as the police crack down on traditions such as “flashing” – riding horses through the streets at a dangerous speed – and washing the horses in the river.The majority of the travellers are well-behaved and only eight arrests were made during this years fair. They say the event is a wholesome tradition that dates back three centuries and the “most important event in the gypsy calendar.They hit back at the locals, claiming they are “racist”.“There’s quite a lot of racism in that village, says one lad.As soon as you mention the word traveller or gypsy they think you’re scum because there are a few gypsies out there that give others a bad name but there’s good and bad in every community.”But pensioner Mervyn says: “Last year was horrendous. They were urinating in the bus shelters and destroying the hay fields.“They’d broken into stables to use them as lavatories. You had to duck when the young boys were driving past because they wind down their windows, clear their throats and spit.”The Appleby Horse Fair has been held every year since   and attracts , travellers and gypsies, , caravans and hundreds of horse drawn carriages plus.A further , visitors flock to enjoy the atmosphere and spectacle of the gathering.But for local police and residents, the fair presents a headache – with the town centre becoming a no-go area as horses are raced through the streets.Local hotel owner Nigel, born and bred in Appleby, says the town is “unrecognisable” throughout the four day fair.“In Appleby, everyone knows each other, we all grew up together and it’s a nice place to live,” he says.“For the ordinary residents of Appleby, [the fair] is pretty awful. You can’t go out, you can’t get to the shops, you can’t drive around.“There are people parking in front of your house, parking a caravan on your front lawn.”Nigel says he locks up the hotel and only lets guests in through the front door.“We put little wooden things on the windows so you can only open them so far, so you can’t get in from the outside.”Mervyn adds: “It reminds me of the air raid precautions in World War II. You don’t expect that in an English country town. I was horried when I saw it.Another resident says she makes sure her doors are locked “so no one comes in the back. You are a bit worried about that.”A third claims the travellers urinated in his garden on two occasions last year.After sundown, the fairgoers descend on the town’s pubs – and things can get rowdy.In , the fairs worst year for violence, a mass brawl broke out and, in total, there were  arrests,  crimes and  incidents.In , a -year-old grandfather accidentally ran over a toddler who ran in front of his car from a traveller encampment, breaking his arm. He was dragged from his car and beaten, suffering a broken vertebrae, black eyes and a bruised head, neck, spleen, liver and kidney.This year, however, the event passed more peacefully and there were just eight arrests.But Kaseem, a bouncer called in as extra security, says the hard-drinking revellers “start kicking off” when told the pub is closing.“As you come towards last orders it’s not like anything you’ve seen before,” adds pub landlord Kyle. “Until you work here you don’t realise what it can be like. We just have to get through it.”At the local Indian restaurant, owner Tariq has replaced his usual chairs with cheaper versions because he doesnt mindthey get destroyed and he says some of the lads that come in refuse to pay the bill or try and do a runner.“One night there was a huge problem with four guys who said they didn’t want to pay for their food,” he says. “I told them ‘You ate here so you’ve got to pay for it’ but they were having none of it.“We had a girl working here and she got that scared she didn’t want to come back.”But the travellers claim the fears are unjustied, and that the locals are prejudiced against them.Romany dad John says: “People look down on us like we’re a piece of sh**. We’re not. We work hard for a living and look after our children like everyone .“We respect the people who don’t do this. They should respect us the same. We should all get on with each other.”Flashing is part and parcel of the horse trade among travelling but the speeding horses prove a hazard to some and accidents are common.In , two horses collided and died during flashing and in  a woman was rushed to hospital with head injuries after being “run over” by a horse and cart during a  carriage race on a public road.Throughout the Channel  show, local police constable Ruth is filmed constantly telling the travellers to “slow down” as they hit dangerous speeds on the slippery rain-soaked road surfaces.But the travellers round on her, shouting “we’re not children”, with one insisting he has a buyer interested in the horse so “he’s got to have speed.”Another defiant seller says: “It’s storming down with rain now but we’re still here and we’ll carry on.”But one helmetless rider pays the price when he is thrown from a speeding horse, suffering serious head injuries that leave him “bleeding from the ear”, and is carted off to hospital in an ambulance. He was discharged two weeks later.Tensions are stretched further when police erect a road block to prevent flashing in the high street and, when  hours of rain leads to rising water levels, police are forced to cut off access to the River Eden.Traditionally horses and riders, who have travelled hundreds of miles to the site, wash themselves by plunging into the River Eden, ensuring the animals being traded are “clean and pretty” for potential buyers.A few years ago, a horse drowned after being led into a deeper part of the river and PC Ruth is concerned the same could happen again.“We can’t let anybody in the river at all,” she says. “It’s far too dangerous for the horses.”But the travellers are convinced the measures are all designed to shut the event down for good.“This fair’s been going on for years and years and they’re trying to stop it,” claims one woman. “They can’t, it’s our heritage.”Another woman, forced to park her two wagons and graze her horses on the side of a busy road because of blocks, rants about the “rude, disrespectful” police.“We’re just people living how we want to live. We’re not horrible people.“No matter what they try and do they’re not going to stop it, are they ”For -year-old Romany Jack, who spent three weeks travelling up from Wales, it’s a chance to catch up with the many friends and family members that are scattered around the country.“I love going to Appleby for that week,” he says. “Your heart lights up to it. Been doing this all my le my whole le, since I was a kid.“We all meet here and we do deals with horses or sell a bird, a canary – anything we can make money with.“Andwe rob one another we rob one another with the [deal on the] horses. You rob me this time, I’ll get you next time.”Head gypsy Billy Welch, who liaises with police and the local council to arrange toilets, rubbish skips and suitable grazing for the horses, says the fair is “sacred” to both old and young. “If you say to these children ‘Do you want to go to Disneyland in Florida or Appleby ’ they definitely want to go to Appleby,” he says. “There’s no contest. It is literally our Mecca. This is where our ancestors have been coming for centuries.“When we sit around our campfires it gives us a feeling of belonging, of ancestry.

withdrawal from the EU should not put the Irish peace deal in danger.Pelosi, , said in a statement: Whatever form it takes, Brexit cannot be allowed to imperil the Good Friday Agreement, including the seamless border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, especially now, as the first generation born into the hope of Good Friday  years ago comes into adulthood.“We cannot go back.”Her comments come after the US national security adviser John Bolton said the UK would be “first in line” for a trade deal after a meeting with Boris Johnson.Should the UK leave the EU in a hard Brexit – without an agreement on October  with the bloc – this could then see the reimposition of border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The Good Friday Agreement was a deal between the warring Catholic and Protestant factions in Northern Ireland to bring an end to the troubles.The deal involved eight political parties from Northern Ireland, as well as the British and Irish governments.It particularly focused on civil and cultural rights, as well as justice and policing.It came against a backdrop of three decades of terrorism and sectarian violence between the rival communities.The deal involved all parties committing themselves to the decommissioning of weapons held by paramilitary groups.Security arrangements would also be normalised after the British Army maintained a heavy presence on the streets of Northern Ireland for  years.Both the British and Irish governments also committed to the early release of prisoners sentenced for paramilitary activity.But the disarmament of these armed groups was set as a condition for the release of their fighters.The agreement committed all signatories to the mutual respect, the civil rights and the religious liberties of everyone in the community.The deal called for the establishment of three “strands” of cooperation to ensure the peace lasted.The first was the creation of the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly – the elected body dealing with the majority of local matters.The second strand was an arrangement for cross-border cooperation between the governments of Ireland and Northern Ireland.And the third called for consultation between the British and Irish governments, which were to remain neutral brokers in the deal.That in turn would undermine the  Good Friday Agreement which helped bring peace to the province.Mr Bolton said Donald Trump’s administration backed a no-deal Brexit and added that the US was ready to do an accelerated series of trade deals should the UK leave without a deal.He suggested these deals would be done on a “sector-by-sector” basis with an agreement on manufacturing done first.“The ultimate end result is a comprehensive trade agreement covering all trading goods and services.“But to get to that you could do it sector by sector, and you can do it in a modular fashion.“In other words, you can carve out some areas where it might be possible to reach a bilateral agreement very quickly, very straightforwardly.”Mr Bolton said deals over financial services and agriculture would not be the first to be agreed.He added there would be keen bipartisan support in Congress for a speedy ratication at each stage.Mr Bolton’s comments have been shot down though.There is also a powerful Irish-American voting bloc in the House that is unlikely to agree any arrangement that undermines the Good Friday Agreement.Then there are also strong lobby groups within the House, such as the agricultural lobby, that are unlikely to agree to any dealtheir own interests, such as agriculture, are seen to be sidelined in any sector-by-sector agreement and not part of a wider deal.Brendan Boyle, the Democratic co-chairman of the Friends of Ireland caucus, told the : “The nonsensical utterings of John Bolton should not be taken seriously. He has no role in trade agreements. Zero.”He added: “I strongly support Speaker Pelosi’s statement today making crystal clear, once again, that protecting the Good Friday agreement is paramount,” Boyle said.“As the Speaker said:Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc staff get 20 pay hikes as pensioners lose their free tv licences","story":"Hundreds of workers at the corporation enjoyed an average rise of £, – costing taxpayers an extra £.million.Figures show  staff members were granted a bump of between  and  per cent followed by another  getting a rise of more than  per cent last year, the Times reports.The total cost across the Beeb was enough to continue free TV licences for , OAPs.Age campaigners described the pay hike as sickening.News of the controversial pay rises comes at an awkward time for the Beeb with corporation chiefs claiming they cannot afford to give out free licences anymore.They now plan to charge .million pensioners £-a-week – while shelling out millions for on-air talent.Last month the corporation was blasted for spending £million on wages in .This represented £million rise on the previous  months and was blasted as “unjustiable” by Tory MP Damian Collins.The £million BBC bill covers all “on-air roles” — from little-known broadcasters to stars earning hundreds of thousands.Household names like Gary Lineker, around £,,-a-year, and Graham Norton, around £, yearly, are among the BBCs highest earners.It is up nearly seven per cent on the previous year — about ½ times the inflation rate.

It started as a passion but I soon realised this is what I wanted to commit all of my time to and went full time just over a year ago. I feel so grateful that I get to do what I love. I enjoy everything about it - the great opportunities, the social side of it, meeting like-minded inspirational people, working with some of my favourite brands.  Also through being an influencer I get to attend many amazing launch parties, red carpet events, film premieres and press trips. However Victoria admits thereaposs one big downside to doing what she does - trolls. She said: It is a very competitive industry so it can get dficult at times, itaposs important to be constantly improving in order to grow.

Mr Tarry, who lived on the Spanish island, suffered the medical episode before the flight took off, and was unable to speak or move when his relatives greeted him in the UK. One crew member said they were concerned about him and gave him a glass of water which was untouched during the flight in April .    When he landed at Stansted Airport, he was escorted from the plane on a wheelchair by airport staff and met by his stunned we and daughters who were left to call paramedics. The family launched legal proceedings against the budget airline and won a High Court battle. The stroke meant Mr Tarry had to move from Palma and into a nursing home in Worthing, West Sussex.

Sebastien, , and Meabh Quoirin, , had waved goodbye to the hustle and bustle of London with their three children as they prepared for an exciting off-the-grid adventure in Malaysia. Tranquility and beautul scenery beckoned them at The Dusan - a small family-run eco-resort more than , miles away in the hills of Negeri Sembilan in Seremban - just south of Kuala Lumper. The family, from Balham, south west London, had booked to stay in one of the luxury holiday cottages where there wasnapost a TV in sight and their morning alarm would be an orchestra of the birds, crickets and frogs. And the little piece of paradise would also offer plenty of privacy, gorgeous views and the chance to explore acres of nature.    But devastation struck when they woke up on the first day of their trip and discovered their eldest daughter Nora, , had vanished without a trace from her bed. Dad Sebastien raised the alarm at am after going into her bedroom to seeshe was awake.  What followed was  agonising days of desperation, despair and heartbreaking pleas to find the teenager with special needs in the vast, dense jungle. The only inkling something untoward had happened was an open window in her room. But no screams had been heard or concrete signs of a break-in found. The search ended in tragedy on Tuesday when the teenaposs body was discovered, beside a small stream about . miles from their resort.    Those who found her said she aposlooked like she was sleepingapos as she lay in plain sight. Sean Yeap, from the search team, claimed Noraaposs body was not hidden or covered and said she was lying with her hands behind her head. Noraaposs family said in a statement: The cruelty of her being taken away is unbearable. Our hearts are broken. The Quoirins had arrived at The Dusan resort on Saturday, August . After the long flight - and seven hour time dference from London - they turned in for the night. But it was while the rest of the family - including siblings Innes, , and Maurice, eight - slept, that Nora vanished. After a search of their accommodation and compound, Sebastien and Meabh became frantic. They realised Nora would be barefoot and wearing her night clothes in a unfamiliar and remote place.    Nora had been born with the brain defect holoprosencephaly, so was especially vulnerable. Hundreds of people joined the search to find her, along with cadaver dogs. At the height of the manhunt, which involved local police and Interpol, around  people were scouring the jungle, including the Seno Praq specialist police team made up of indigenous peoples with forest tracking skills. Teams used drones and helicopters with thermal imaging and searchers played loudspeaker recordings of her motheraposs soothing voice into the jungle. Known paedophiles were also interviewed and police visited the homes of at least  local people as part of the hunt.    The Lucie Blackman Trust spoke on behalf of the family issuing updates as police and the family clashed over whether Nora had been abducted. Police said they were treating it as a missing persons case while the Quoirins insisted criminal activity had been involved as Nora had dficulty with walking, balancing and looking after herself. They gave emotional TV interviews, offered a reward, and shared family photos of Nora in a bid for someone to come forward with information. A number of Malaysian shamans also performed spirit summoning rituals. One video shows shaman Khalis Mohammad claiming Nora had been lured out her room by a genie, who had chosen her to be his step-child. He vowed to persuade the spirit toher but warned they would ask for something .    Top child protection officer Jim Gamble, who investigated the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, also called for the National Crime Agencyto be involved in the hunt for Nora. He said: “It’s in no way to undermine the approach of the Malaysian police. It’s simply a recognition that these instances in these circumstances are so rare that very few organisations have the corporate memory, the technical ability and operational experience to deal with them, and the NCA certainly does.” He added last Thursday: “We’re in the critical stage now and I am desperately hoping for the best. “Even this far into it, there is still hope. We’ve got to hope that they’ve got the right resources at their disposal in Malaysia. He said children going missing on holiday was “so rare, in fact, that I can only think of three cases — Ben Needham, Madeline McCann and now Nora”.    But the news the family had been dreading came on Tuesday. Nora was discovered in hilly and dficult terrain not accessible to vehicles around a one hour and  minute walk from the resort. It sparked fresh questions about why police who had earlier swept the area had been unable to find her. Sean Yeap, who was among the team who found her, also revealed Nora was naked with scratches on her arms and laying with her head on her hands asshe was sleeping when she was found. Mr Yeap said: It looked like she was sleeping, but we all knew she was dead. It was very sad and two women in the group did not want to come close and they started crying. The insurance salesman added: I think maybe she was where and walked to the stream perhaps to drink some water.    The place where she was found is not easy to find. I wondershe had been following the stream as there were no footprints which means she could have been walking in the water as it was not very deep. Police have refused to rule out foul play and are continuing a criminal investigation alongside a missing persons inquiry, pending the outcome of the post-mortem. Speaking to France TV, Noraaposs grandad Sylvain Quoirin, said that the family has collapsed over the loss of their pearl. He said that his son identied Nora by looking at her face. Sebastien was there, [they] showed him her face and he saw that it was Nora. Itaposs her, for sure, he added. Itaposs catastrophic, itaposs terrible. Sebastien is strong, despite everything, because he has to handle many problems. But I can tell you that they have collapsed. Everyone has collapsed. We lost a pearl, an innocent.    These are moments [in le] that I do not wish anyone. The cause of Noraaposs death remains unknown. An update had been expected today but a post-mortem examination at a hospital in Seremban is ongoing and no further developments are expected until tomorrow. Matthew Searle of the Lucie Blackman Trust, which is supporting Noraaposs family, said: The post-mortem is ongoing, therefore no conclusion has been reached yet. A police press conference, due on Wednesday, is now expected to take place at an as-yet unspecied time on Thursday. Noraaposs devastated family have said their hearts are broken and paid tribute to her as the truest, most precious girl. They made an emotional statement released through the trust, describing how the teenager, who lived in London and was the daughter of French-Irish parents, had truly touched the world. They said: Nora is at the heart of our family. She is the truest, most precious girl and we love her infinitely.    The cruelty of her being taken away is unbearable. Our hearts are broken. They offered thanks to those involved in the search for the teenager, adding: Nora has brought people together, especially from France, Ireland, Britain and Malaysia, united in their love and support for her and her family. Hundreds of people were involved in the search operation and it was volunteer helpers who found her body. Deputy police chief Mazlan Mansor told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that the body was not in any clothings and that the probe was considering all possibilities, including the angle of criminal investigation. He said the body was found in an area that had previously been searched by rescuers. Mr Searle appealed to people not to speculate about what happened to Nora: There will be a time for comment but that time is not now. Let the family grieve in peace.

Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton has reversed that policy by saying we will now be first in line. There is no doubt we need a new agreement with our second-largest trading partner – but that should not come at any price. Despite sympathetic noises from the White House, we should remember Trump’s mantra on international trade is America First. The UK, which would enter any negotiations from a position of weakness, will be under pressure to allow US firms to plunder our health service and take in their chlorinated chicken or hormone-raised beef. We should not accept lower food standards or opening the doors of the NHS to US private vultures as the cost of a free trade deal. The Trump administration may sound like our friends but it represents aggressive US corporations ready to exploit us.

Samantha Grywalsky, , from Midland, Michigan in the US, says she hatched the plan after boyfriend, Jacob Glasgow, told her pal had sent him flirty messages over social media.  She even claims the friend had invited him over to her house for sex but the couple say they decided to get their revenge and catch her in the act. Jacob invited the friend to his car while Samantha hid in the boot, recording the entire encounter. Samantha said: I wanted to see how far she would take it and what she would do to my boyfriend behind closed doors. So my boyfriend offered to put me in the trunk three blocks away from the party and I just got in and he closed me in before pulling into her driveway.  It was very small and very cramped. Iaposm  so Iaposm huge. So I was squished. She got in the car and I was in the boot, but we had cracked the seats [forward] so I could hear a bit. It was a bit muffled. I heard the door open and close, and then she shouted aposJacobapos. It sounded to me like she was drunk but I found out later, she was completely sober. I was shocked. I heard her say, aposyou have no idea how long I have wanted to f*** youapos. So my boyfriend was not really feeding into it so much, but was just going, aposoh yeah  Uhuh. What  apos [It was] just to try and get more out of her because he knew I was recording the whole thing. I got to hear her tell my boyfriend everything she would like to do to him. Sheaposs not very creative, let me tell you that.  It was so cringey. I was like, aposI could jump through this seat, scare the s*** out of her, punch her, make her jump out of the carapos. But I was thinking, aposno, youaposve known how this is going to be the whole time, youaposve practised self-restraint this long, let this play out how it needs to play out.” Jacob then opened the boot of the car pretending to look for condoms when Samantha jumped out and slid into the back seat. Samantha added: After he had finished aposrummaging around for his condomsapos in the trunk, he opened it enough for me to get out and I got into the back seat and she turned and her face was f***ing gold. It was so funny. She looked like her dog had just ran into the street. It was like a frozen face of shock and she immediately dropped it when I half-smiled at her.

The aquarium has revealed on their Facebook page the highs and lows of penguin le - and their Penguin of the Month award reveals the good deeds as well as the skulduggery.   . GOOD - Dora Dora was such a trooper at our regular health checks this month. She waddled straight over to the scales and, with a little helping hand and no fuss at all, popped up to be weighed. If only everybody was as compliant on weigh day as Dora!  NAUGHTY - Mr Mac Mr Mac takes the cakethis month! Can you believe he snatched a fish right out of his girlfriend Luluaposs mouth  Taking food from an almost blind penguin - how could you Mr Mac!    . NAUGHTY – Dave Dave just can’t get it together and stay off the naughty list! We take great pride in keeping Penguin Cove clean and tidy. However for Dave this is an opportunity to cause mischief, and as cute as he is, it tends to make this job tricky for our keepers. We’re going to seewe can get some video evidence of him in action so watch this space!  GOOD – Betty Our Betty is one of our sweetest penguins and is such a joy! She never lets the hustle and bustle of the other penguins get to her. She goes about her day without putting a flipper wrong. Maybe she’s starting to be a good influence on her boyfriend Mo - who hasnapost been on the naughty list for some time    . NAUGHTY - Martin  Martin is new to our Penguin Cove . While he was in our rehabilitation centre he was a bit of a grump . Heaposs settled in well, however has become a bit of Casanova – he started to muscle in on Luluand Draco . Timmy promptly put him in his place, Mr Mac is taking it all in his waddle. We’ve got some tough boys at Penguin Cove so keep your flippers to yourself Martin!

NAUGHTY- Dave Because Dave has been partially hand raised, he’s really close to humans and as part of penguin relationship building they like to preen each other. We had one recent gentleman who took part in a Penguin Encounter and had the privilege of Dave preening him. Dave’s very young and doesn’t know his own strength so a few hairs were tugged at on his legs - but our guest thought this was pretty special. GOOD - Burny Before moulting Burny had been spending a lot of time in her burrow. Now with some lovely new feathers, she’s been taking care of them really well!! She’s spending all day in the water and making a conscious effort to preen and keep them in good condition. Nice work Burny.    . GOOD - Elmo Elmo, our oldest resident, has been waddling out of her burrow to eat. This is a fantastic effort as we usually provide her with room service. Sheaposs missing a flipper , is rather elderly at  years oldand she has cataracts. We lt you Elmo.

If a pepperoni slice is in the wrong place or the fresh dough has not been stretched to the right size, contestants are penalised by  seconds per error demonstrating it’s not easy to win this unusual title. But Jaff managed to do so once again, and as such heaposs been rewarded with a very special trophy - a solid gold cast of his magical pizza-making hands, inspired by the Hollywood Walk of Fame.    The quirky trophy will be on display at the Portsmouth Fratto branch of the pizza company, the store where Jaff trained and perfected his skills for over  years. Speaking about his win, Jaff commented: I’ve been making Domino’s pizzas for over  years, and to win this title once again makes me really proud. Customers don’t always realise the skill that goes into making a Domino’s pizza, from hand-stretching the fresh dough and leveling the sauce with my own personal spoodle, to perfectly placing the fresh toppings. It’s great to be recognised for doing what I love, and I would encourage anyone who is interested in becoming a pizza maker themselves to pop into their local Domino’s store and speak to the store manager.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

Goddards were granted permission to turn the house into a wedding venue with marquees in July , but Scottish Borders Council imposed strict conditions on the use after receiving strong objections from neighbours.One condition, that the planning permission was only valid for two years, was removed on appeal but the condition that only two rooms can be rented out in the mansion at a time has remained in place.The most recent application, submitted by Lanark-based Burrel Design Studios on behalf of the Goddards, seeks to lt this condition and allow guests to stay in the mansions year-round.A supporting statement accompanying the application reads: ldquoThe effect of the councilrsquos ruling means that year-round self-catering accommodation may legitimately be offered in the lodge, the white house and penthouse, and the rights bestowed under the planning acts mean that year-round bed and breakfast accommodation may be offered for a maximum of two bedrooms within Hartree

the historic structure from being a building lsquoat riskrsquo to being a fully restored historic building incorporating some contemporary elements, which have served to reconcile former unsympathetic earlier additions and have made the building fit for occupation in the current age.ldquoRegrettably, the limitations imposed by the planning status of the property at Hartree have restricted the opportunity for the current owners to accommodate visitors who have wished to re-establish their connection with Hartree House.ldquoThe opportunity to offer accommodation in Hartree House to guests will add signicantly to the attraction of Hartree as a venue and will assist towards the upkeep of the house and grounds.A castle, known as Hartree Tower, was present on the site by at least the th century, but was demolished in the late th century by Colonel Alexander Dickson, who rebuilt the current Hartree House in its place.In , the property was passed to Elizabeth Dickson after her brother

Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms.

We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use. It is dangerous.ldquoThere never has been a route proposed on this application and there is still not one to this day.ldquoSo how could it have been approved, without knowing where the traffic is going Melrose community councillor Mr Douglas claimed SBC was ldquounnecessarily endangering the publicrsquos lives and putting financial expedience before public safety in a letter to council chief executive Tracey Logan.And he asked to see a copy of a lsquopre-planning application decisionrsquo on potential vehicle routes.But, in a response, Ms Logan said: ldquoI have been advised no such document exists.She added the council had considered a transport statement and a report from the public consultation process.However, she admitted: ldquoNo detail of vehicle routes was included within either document. This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire. Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic.... We anticipate Levenseat will determine the best routes over the coming weeks.An SBC spokesperson added: ldquoThe number of trips to the waste transfer station is largely in line with trips to the previous landfill site, and signicantly less than could have been generated by an integrated waste management facility at Easter Langlee.ldquoAs part of the planning application which was approved in November , the council committed to improving the road network through additional street-lighting, better signage, localised road widening and removal of trees and vegetation, all of which have taken place.ldquoThe council was not able to define a route during the planning process as the procurement exercise had not been completed and therefore SBC did not know the end destination or the preferred route.ldquoThe new residual waste contract will see the majority of the waste treated to produce a refuse derived fuel ndash to generate heat and electricity ndash as well as recover materials which can be recycled.ldquoThe closure of the landfill site and opening of waste transfer station will also see a reduction in harmful greenhouse gases from landfilling the waste and we believe it will also result in an improved recycling performance."},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-set-17th-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock this weekend as it welcomes musicians, dancers and performers to the towns th annual music festival.The StRonans Hotel and Live  Local at the Vale Club have put together a jam-packed programme of bands overthree days.And the Church of Scotland, Tweedside Hotel, Masons Club and the Union Club are all set to host a number of events.The music kicks off on Friday at pm in the St Ronanrsquos Hotel with the Redwood Rejects, at pm with Fin Price at lsquoLive  Localrsquo and at pm with Sparky  The Choirboys at the Tweedside Hotel.On Saturday, alongside the full programmes of bands around Innerleithen, the town is packed with events, starting with the St Ronanrsquos Silver Band coffee morning.Afterwards, the band will be continuing their eight-hour sponsored play out and about in the town.At the Church of Scotland therersquos concerts galore with The Taylor Family  Friends, Borders piper Matt Seattle accompanied by guitarist Donald Knox, and superb Innerleithen-born singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby.Over at the Masons, the regions favourite cover band The Derivatives are appearing, while Rory Speirs is at the Tweedside.There will be something for all the family to enjoy, with a wide selection of workshops, including beginnerrsquos ballet and line dance with the Fiona Henderson School of Dance, as well as singing, belly-dancing and an introduction to ukelele.There will also be an opportunity to learn more about the town on a historical walk with local experts from the Innerleithen Community Trust.Sunday sees the music continue over at the Church of Scotland, with a concert by leading Scots folk singer Christine Kydd, supported by the Borders Gaelic singing group lsquoTurasrsquo and Folksters.And to round off the weekend, therersquos informal music sessions at the Gordon Arms and the Corner House hotels.One of the festivals organisers, Robin Dempsey said: ldquoWe are really excited that we have possibly our biggest ever line up, with around  performances and events on the programme, spread over eight venues.ldquoThe music festival is truly encouraging local talent in the community and it is great to see so many locals and visitors coming together to share their love of music.ldquoWhat has really helped this year is support from our new sponsor, private development group, Whiteburn, who are currently regenerating the former Caerlee Mill site in the town.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

McDonnells Edinburgh Declaration caught the Scottish political world completely by surprise. The SNP couldnt believe their ears. I initially thought his remarks, especially the reference to ldquothe English Parliament, were just a badly-briefed UK politician talking off the cuff. But no. It is now apparently UK Labour policy to accept the SNPrsquos call for ldquoindyref. Gobs were well and truly smacked.Most smacked of all were the Scottish Labour Partys. Their leader, Richard Leonard, was left speechless. The Shadow Chancellor had directly contradicted Labours  manesto promise to oppose a repeat referendum. Only in March, Leonard made clear in an interview with the Daily Record, that a future Labour government would, like Theresa May, refuse any request for a ldquoSection  Order to trigger a legally-binding referendum on independence. No s no buts.:Scottish Labour registers lowest level of income in nearly two decadesNot any more, it seems. The Branch Office, as the SNP like to call Scottish Labour, has been told to back the policy of their deadly enemy. Christmas has come early for Nicola Sturgeon, without the turkeys.Many Scottish Labour MSPs were incandescent, as was the former Labour shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray MP, who called McDonnell ldquoludicrous and demanded that he ldquoapologise to Richard Leonard , and reaffirm Labours policy of opposition to a referendum . Off-the-record comments from Scottish Labour figures were unprintable. Unionist Labour MSPs put together a statement ldquodeploring\" the change in policy. This backfired when it emerged they hadnt cleared it with Richard Leonards office.The Labour MP, Paul Sweeney, then added to the confusion by calling for a multi-option referendum including federalism, or devo max as it used to be called. This was once proposed by Alex Salmond in , and rejected by Labour and the Conservatives in favour of a binary Yes No question. Saying Labour were all over the place would be an insult to geography.So, what on earth is going on  Why was one of the key figures in the UK Labour party provoking a split on one of the most contentious issues in British politics  And right in the middle of the Brexit row. Labour is now ided every which way on the constitution: over Scottish independence and over leaving Europe. McDonnell has left the Scottish party an impossible task: trying to win Scottish votes without a policy on Scotland in a general election thats possibly weeks away.:Scottish Labour breaks silence over anti-semitism investigation by blasting \"biased\" BBCWhat seems to have happened is this. Labour, at a UK level, has started to think about forming much wider political alliances in future in order to defeat the rising tide of the right. This has been discussed by a number of Labour people, including the former BBC economics editor Paul Mason in his book Clear Bright Future.Mason has argues that Labour should abandon its traditional base in the white working class and the trades union movement, and look to creating a new progressive alliance, or ldquopopular front, with LGBT and BAME groups, and with other progressive political parties. Mason regards the SNP, unlike most other nationalist parties, as progressive and social democratic. On the eve of McDonnells Edinburgh interview Mason called infor ldquoa penalty-free independence referendum whenever Holyrood chooses.Im not saying that Paul Mason is writing Labour policy. Far from it. Many in the party regard him with suspicion, not least for appearing to abandon the working class. But it looks asthe Labour leadership has finally been persuaded that the SNP is not just a band of ldquotartan Tories, and that Jeremy Corbyn could do business with Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labour is anyway likely to be crushed again in the forthcoming General Wlection, while the SNP is in line for around  Westminster seats according to the polls. Its support would almost certainly be requiredLabour is to try to form a government, and McDonnells intervention could be an attempt to prepare the ground. Theres been no love lost between Corbyn and the mostly Blairite rump of the Scottish Labour Party, so he probably regards them as expendable.Not that Labour is admitting any of this. Indeed, the line from McDonnell in Edinburgh, echoed by the Shadow Business Secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey on Newsnight, is that Labour will not form any ldquocoalitions or pacts with anyone. Labour is still smarting from those Tory election posters in  which showed the then leader, Ed Miliband, in Alex Salmonds breast pocket. It is imperative for Labour, in England at least, to deny any hint of an alliance with the SNP.But Scotland is a dferent. A ing Labour government in Westminster would require the tacit assistance of the SNP, perhaps on a confidence and supply basis. At any rate, the UK party leadership seems to have decided that offering a referendum is a risk worth taking to help some future co-operation to happen. This is huge development and raises questions about whether Labour can still be called a Unionist party.Paul Hutcheon: the biggest threat to the Union is Scottish Labours disintegrationLast week felt asa dam has broken. After three years in which Scottish politics has been in suspended animation, suddenly everyone was talking about independence again. Even Conservative commentators like The Times Iain Martin are now calling for a referendum in five years. s Simon Jenkins believes independence itself is now unavoidable, and called on Westminster to plan for it now.Of course, a referendum may not deliver a Yes. The polls still show Scotland split down the middle on independence. But this is a vindication of Nicola Sturgeons cautious, constitutional approach to winning independence. It is a blow to her critics, who had been calling for an unauthorised referendum, or even UDI. The former SNP MP, George Kerevan, had been calling for mass civil disobedience to obstruct London transport. But this is a blow her internal critics will be happy to take for there is now a real possibility of a referendum in the next couple of years.That isLabour manages to defeat Boris Johnson ndash a big ask, perhaps, but far from impossible. There will likely be a vote of no confidence the Tory PM next month, and he will almost certainly lose. If Labour fails to form an alternative government in  days, then Johnson has to call a General Election. Hes hoping to delay polling day until after Brexit on October . But that is a risky tactic. Such constitutional jiggery pokery could easily alienate voters, many of whom are anyway unconvinced by Johnsons abilities.Just about anything could happen in the next few weeks. But what is not in doubt is that Scottish independence, or at least a referendum, is back on the agenda. And almost exactly five years since the last one."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-receives-500-000-expenses-payout-scottish-government","story":"In January , Mr Salmond was accused ofinappropriate behaviourand an internal investigation was carried out by officials.However, the former First Minister went on to launcha judicial review into the way the probe was carried out and the government wasforced to admit it had breached guidelinesby appointing an investigating officer who had \"prior involvement\".Ministers have now confirmed that they have paid the substantial settlement for his expensesin the case.A Scottish Government spokesman said today: ldquoWe can confirm that final settlement of pound, has been made to Mr Salmond for legal costs arising from his petition for judicial review.MSPs at Holyrood have established an inquiry into what went wrong with the Scottish Governments probe, but it has been suspended until acriminal case against Mr Salmond concludes.Despite this, oppositionMSPs have now stepped up calls for Holyrood to \"get to the bottom\" of the failed investigation.Scottish Conservative MSP, and member of the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints, Donald Cameron said: ldquoIt is outrageous that over half a million pounds has been wasted thanks to the botched handling of this investigation.ldquoThis is taxpayersrsquo money that will be handed over to Alex Salmond thanks to the appalling way these complaints were dealt with.\"The payout also came under fire from Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton.ldquoParliament will have to get to the bottom of this expensive and flawed inquiry, he said.Following a separate policeinvestigation, Mr Salmond was subsequently charged with with a string of sexual offences which he denies."},{"url":null,"title":"new-youth-project-researches-impact-climate-change-coast","story":"The On Our Wave Length initiative will see teams of young people from Argyll and Bute, Fe, North Berwick, South Ayrshire and the Western Isles investigate environmental consequences on beaches and waters of their local coasts.The partnership between YouthLink Scotland and Traditional Arts and Culture Scotland, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, will pair the Young Heritage Researchers with youth workers to assist in their findings.Experts from Scottish Natural Heritage and Scottish Coastal Archeology and the Problem of Erosionwill also be on hand to help.:Youth climate strikes: Show the world we stand up for planet EarthThe young people will be encouraged to set their own research parameters and explore issues that matter most to them and their communities from climate breakdown, industry pollution and the impact on wildle and oceans.Amy Calder, Senior Policy and Research Officer, YouthLink Scotland said:\"Watching Greta Thunberg and young people across the world marching through the streets to fight for a sustainable future, showing adults that climate change is real and needs tackling now, has been extremely inspiring.\"It also highlights the power of youth voice in holding adults to account for actions that will affect them and future generations.\"Early next year the project will launch a youth-led national campaign to highlight the damaging environmental and and social impacts on sea-side communities.The initiative launches at the beginning of the Year of Coasts and Waters  where Scotlands waters will be celebrated with a programme of activity designed to inspire both visitors and locals to explore and experience the countrys unrivalled shores.Well established annual festivities such as the Scottish Traditional Boat Festival at Portsoy and Crail Food Festival will be joined by The Fe Regatta, an expanded Clydebuilt Festival, and Edinburgh International Film Festival will present Scotlands Shores, featuring classic film screenings and a special outdoor coastal experience.The RSPB will celebrate Aberdeens status as one of the few cities in Europe where dolphins can regularly be seen from the shore at DolphinFest .

has said using any type of mobile phone while driving had potentially catastrophic consequences and warned that current laws give the \"misleading impression\" that hands-free options are safe.And the MPs called for more severe penalties ldquocommensurate with the risks, as road deaths linked to phone use have risen steadily over the past decade.A public consultation on the proposal should be published by the end of , the cross-party group said.It is understood the Scottish Government would support a ban on hands-free mobile phones from a road safety point of view as long as the proposal is backed with evidence and proper impact assessments.It comes as it emerged research found that Scotland is a UK hotspot for distracted driving offences.Court penalties doubled when tough mobile phone driving laws were introduced in March, .And research using freedom of legislation carried out for the motor dealers Peter Vardy revealed that in around nine months after the new legislation, there had been , recorded offences since March across  constabularies in the UK.Scotland was said to have been the worst region, accounting for , of these.A separate survey at around the same time to determine the places that are the worst offenders found that came top with nearly three in four admitting to using their phones behind the wheel. This was closely followed by London where % said they used their phones while driving, as did % of Glaswegians, % in Cardf and % of Birmingham drivers.The safest place for other drivers and pedestrians appears to be Southampton, where just one in twenty of drivers admitted to using their phones. While people in Bristol , Manchesterand Nottinghammade up the four lowest cities for mobile phone use behind the wheel.:Lorry driver caught checking his phone before fatal crash jailed for five yearsIn September, last year, -year-old recovery driver David Shields who was caught on camera checking his phone prior to a fatal crash was jailed for five years.The driver crashed into -year-old Yvonne Blackmans car in a line of traffic on the A in Dumfries last February.He had previously admitted a charge of causing the mother-of-fours death by dangerous driving.Footage captured Shields, of Drongan, East Ayrshire, focusing on his phone for a full  seconds in the lead-up to the fatal crash.Brake, the road safety charity said research showed using a hands-free phone can impair a driver in the same way as a hand-held device and so it makes sense that the law treats these acts equally.A Brake spokesman said: ldquoThe number of distracted driving offences in Scotland is cause for concern and highlights that there is still much work to be done regarding the dangers of phone use behind the wheel.:Time to ban phones in schools: Cross-party MSPs call for Holyrood investigationldquoWe need urgent clarication of the law on using hand-held mobile devices while driving, including closing loopholes which treat sending or receiving data dferently.\"The current law also provides a dangerous  impression that it is safe to use a mobile phone with a hands-free kit - it is not. All phone use behind the wheel is dangerous, and we need the law to reflect this by banning the use of hands-free devices.\"It is also true that a law is only as strong as its enforcement and so we want to see further resources provided to the police to make sure there is an effective deterrent to the menace of mobile phone use behind the wheel.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWhile the power to legislate in this area is reserved to the UK Government, we are clear that road safety is a priority and we recognise that driving while distracted puts the driver and other road users at greater risk.ldquoWe continue to support behavioural change and marketing campaigns through Road Safety Scotland. The message from us and all road safety partners is clear - do not risk your safety or the safety of others by using a mobile phone behind the wheel of a car."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10270163.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tennents-maps-scotlands-top-15-pubs-view","story":"A new guide to Scotlands most scenic pubs has been launched in a bit to introduce beerlovers to a pint with a view.But anyone wishing to finish the trek will have to get their walking boots on and have some time to spare , as it criss-crosses the country for  miles by land and sea and none of the bars are exactly local.However, when they have called last orders on the mammoth trip, they will have visited some of Scotlands most stand-out hostelries, including a -year-old coaching inn, a pint aboard a boat on Loch Katrine and a bar located within the stunning glens of the Cairngorms National Park.The map was Tennents ideaThe lsquoViewPintsrsquo map, celebrates  pubs and bars across the country with the most spectacular views as judged by brewers Tennants -

Itrsquos just something that I wanted to do. Irsquove been trying to keep it a bit of a secret, but Irsquove been enjoying the process of doing it.Scots of any vintage will have little trouble knowing the song from which it takes its name. Written in , it was recorded two-years later, and amid a plethora of cover versions, popped up to some fame on the  Tennentrsquos Lager advert by Frankie Miller, reprised by MacLean himself years later.But while it might be one of Scotlandrsquos ldquoother national anthems, itrsquos clear for MacLean that it means so very much more. ldquoI wrote the script myself, I wrote the story, which is a nice thing to do at my stage of le after all these years as a travelling troubadour and songwriter, he says. ldquoIrsquove got so many songs, therersquos  songs Irsquove written over the years and Irsquove got this great story ndash itrsquos a love story ndash and itrsquos cool.He revealed that it was his time spent in Glasgow, as musical director at the Citizenrsquos Theatre for the hugely successful A Scots Quair trilogy staged by Glasgowrsquos TAG theatre company in  and featuring Sunset Song, that lay the foundations for his move into musicals.He said: ldquoI thought to myself, I know how this works, I can visualise a stage production Irsquom performing all the timeI know how audiences work, I know the songs that Irsquove written over the last  years and the ones that work onstage with people, so itrsquos great to just make a story and bring all those songs into that story.While he wants to keep the core theme under wraps ndash its worth waiting for ndash he hints: ldquoItrsquos amazing that a song that I might have written for myself, thatyou put it in another situation, it changes the whole dynamic of the song.And he hopes it will strike a chord with a new generation of fans, as well as those who love the song and his other bodies of work already.He said: ldquoCaledonia was a homesick song. I wrote it when I was on a beach in Brittany in France. I finished it and was staying in a youth hostel with three friends who were Irish, we were busking basically in the streets around France.ldquoWersquod jump on a train, see a nice town and get off, did a few wee gigs and I finished the song off.ldquoI remember going back to the youth hostel where we were staying, singing it to them, we were all that homesick anyway, and we left the next day.ldquoThe first time I ever performed it was in West Berlin. Irsquod gone back to Germany and was touring around and I didnrsquot do many of my own songs at that time, I did a lot more traditional songs, a bit of fiddle, and I snuck this song in and the audience just loved it. Even way back then, I was  maybe, I turned around and said wersquoll keep that in the set.And he is proud he did. ldquoCaledonia is only a tiny, little part of what I do. But therersquos something about it that became part of common culture which is fascinating and which is a great thrill for a songwriter to have something that is part of it ndash that is sung at football games, played at Scottish weddings, is played at funerals, you hear buskers singing it in the streets.

I remember when the band Alba told us they were getting their Highland bagpipes out, we were all ndash you cannae get your Highland bagpipes out in a folk band because they were B flat and what have you. But these guys worked out how to do it.ldquoThe concert is more of a solo concert with me touching my cap to the piping tradition. Irsquove always liked to use whistles and bagpipes, rather that saxophones ndash because they are Scottish.MacLean says Scotland is in rude health, culturally, shaking off the stereotypical caricature of the Harry Lauder years, adding: ldquoTherersquos a lovely, modern, sophisticated image that we have now and Irsquod like to think Irsquove been part of that whole cultural revolution that began to happen around  years ago.Next month he turns , but he laughs: ldquoIrsquom busier this year than Irsquove ever been.

People choose their own anthemic songs, and I donrsquot know why Caledonia has seeped into this.Therersquos probably not a night goes by and therersquos not a drunk standing somewhere singing Caledonia.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON THE MEANING BEHIND CALEDONIAWhen you are young, you donrsquot have the baggage of le so you are a wee bit more honest in what you say and in what you write.I mean, I was just really very homesick and I wrote what was there.If I tried to write it now, I probably couldnrsquot, because I would be saying lsquooh no, thatrsquos too sentimentalrsquo or whatever.Caledonia is a big song over in Ireland, itrsquos a big song whenever Irsquom over in Europe, itrsquos about the sense of belonging that it has.It encapsulates your own sense of belonging, for me I would make it Scotland.But therersquos something  in that song that people identy with in terms of their own sense of belonging.I donrsquot know where it is today.Therersquos a lot of political turmoil, Irsquom not sure anybody knows how it will turn out. I try to sometimes to imagine whatrsquos going to happen, where itrsquos going to go, but I canrsquot.But I think having songs like Caledonia help people keep their cultural sense of identity, and an identity can be all-encompassing too.TURNING HIT SONG CALEDONIA INTO DOUGIE MACLEANrsquoS FIRST MUSICALItrsquos a musical - Irsquom in the middle of working on it. Caledonia the Musical. Itrsquos just something that I wanted to do.Irsquove been trying to keep it a bit of a secret, but Irsquove been enjoying the process of doing it.I wrote the script myself, I wrote the story, which is a nice thing to do at my stage of le after all these years as a travelling troubadour and songwriter.Irsquove got so many songs, there are  songs Irsquove written over the years and Irsquove got this great story ndash itrsquos a love story ndash and itrsquos cool.I was musical director years and years and years ago for TAG theatre company here in Glasgow at the Citizens Theatre for a three play series, A Scots Quair, and so I learned quite a lot in the process of being involved with that because we had music on stage as well.Irsquove been using a lot of what I learned there.I thought to myself, I know how this works, I can visualise a stage production Irsquom performing all the time for I know how audiences work, I know the songs that Irsquove written over the last  years and the ones that work on stage with people, so itrsquos great to just make a story and bring all those songs into that story.Itrsquos amazing that a song that I might have written for myself, thatyou put it in another situation, it changes the whole dynamic of the song.INFLUENCING SCOTLANDrsquoS CULTURAL IDENTITYScotland has a very modern vision of itself, a modern, progressive vision of its national identity which is kind of unusual.Irsquom glad that Scotland has developed it that way.Irsquom very proud of our Scottish Parliament, I think itrsquos very progressive and modern and I think Scotlandrsquos is a great international brand ndash people love Scotland, they love the whole concept of Scotland, I donrsquot know how politically it will all fold out because it gets very complicated.Itrsquos not a black and white thing anymore. There have been a lot of things ndash a lot of lies ndash said. People are maybe looking at ita bit more.Even culturally, Irsquove seen a huge dference in my letime the way that Scottish people identy themselves as Scottish.Back when we were kids we were embarrassed to be Scottish, it was that old buffoon with the wiggly stick and the hairy legs, the Harry Lauder caricature of being a Scot, but I think people arenrsquot anything like that ndash therersquos a lovely, modern, sophisticated image that we have now and our culturersquos been part of that.Irsquod like to think Irsquove been part of that whole cultural revolution that happened  years ago where it went away from being music hall to people writing their own stuff, we werenrsquot playing on the caricature of being Scottish, we were creating a fantastic cultural revolution ndash not just the folk guys, but the rock guys and everyone .DOUGIE MACLEAN ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE AND EUROPEI think Scots are more confident in being Scottish, and maybe that will inevitably lead to independence.I donrsquot how that journey will go, but Irsquod like to see it myself because I believe in small things.I believe in independence, but part of a bigger thing.And itrsquos been like that in my own le, Irsquove been very independent in how Irsquove gone about things ndash I have my own company, my own studio, so I was in control of my own destiny.But without the bigger thing, it would be very dferent.Irsquom independent but in a big music scene. I think we need to be part of that bigger thing .:Dougie MacLean: lsquoI want people to be talking about Live by the Loch in next  yearsI think part of cultural identity is the brand, thatrsquos the glue thatkeeps the world together ndash everybody loves their cultural identity, andyou can invent one that encompasses and brings in other peoplersquos cultural identities too, then you have a modern Scotland that is quite dferent from the one that my dad would have imagined.Thatrsquos what makes my songs dferent from James Taylor songs because he writes them from an American perspective, but Irsquom not singing about traditional things, I write about human things.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON BEING A SCOTTISH MUSICAL PIONEERWhen we set up the record company, I built a wee recording studio, and nobody was doing it at the time. It was me and Ossian, another folk group, who were a great help.It was vinyl in these days, and you couldnrsquot get vinyl cut in Scotland, so I remember the first record I made up in Butterstone was a fiddle record and I had to get on an overnight Stagecoach to London, to Soho where they had the cutting rooms, with the master tapes under my arms, to get the vinyl cut on this thing.Thatrsquos where I learned that they used a diamond needle on the cutting machines, but they only used the new diamond needles for the big acts and when it was worn they put it on an old machine at the back and cut all the independents with it.People donrsquot realise thatrsquos how I did it.It was the early days of Stagecoach which is from Perthshire, and they had two old buses.The driver would stop halfway down, about Carlisle somewhere, and get this gin box out with his Thermos flask and come round to give everybody a cup of coffee and a sandwich that his we had made ndash that was it then, though Stagecoach are huge now of course.But thatrsquos how we had to do it.The CD has become devalued because it is so easy to make. But back then people said oh, yoursquoll never be able to do it, yoursquoll never be able to stay in Dunkeld, yoursquoll have to go to London, New York or even Glasgow or Edinburgh.But I was dogged, I said no, Irsquom going to stay here, and I made it.I live in my old school, the school that I went to, and my dad went to. Itrsquos a great story.I am on facetime a lot with my son Jamie who produces my records now, it all ties together. I like that. Itrsquos not an ego-driven lestyle, I keep bees, I collect Singer sewing machines, wersquore all surviving and itrsquos just our lives. Itrsquos what we do.TRYST AND DOUGIE MACLEAN PERFORMING AT PIPING LIVE! IN GLASGOWOne of the things about the TRYST concert, it was really nice of the guys to ask me to come along and be part of the Piping Live! Festival because I had a long history with bagpipes.I joined The Tannahill Weavers when I was , thatrsquos when that whole piping revolution was happening.I remember when the band Alba told us they getting their Highland bagpipes out, we were all ndash you cannae get your Highland bagpipes out in a folk ban,d because they were B flat and what have you.But these guys worked out how to do it and I ended up touring American with wee Alan on bagpipes, and I had my relationship with young Gordon Duncan who played on all my records when he was a youngster.This was all before it became really well established.The concert is more of a solo concert with me touching my cap to the piping tradition.I did a tour of America one time with Kathy Mattea who had just won a Grammy at the time, and she had come to my studio and we had recorded lsquoFrom a Distancersquo and Gordy had played a little bit of pipes on it for her.So when I went to America and did the special guest on her tour, she said lsquooh, I wish we could do that with the bagpipesrsquo so I learned the part of small pipes ndash it was the only part I could ever learn to play ndash and I walked onto the stage playing that. I felt a fraud.But I did it, Irsquom just hoping someone has a recording or photograph somewhere.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON PERFORMING IN GLASGOWI love Glasgow, I come down a lot. I did a solo show there recently which was brilliant and Irsquove done shows over the years, all the theatres around here and I worked at the Citizens.I remember coming down here as an eight-year-old, my uncle Roddy liked in Castlemilk, and coming down from where I lived up in Dunkeld, I might as well have been going to the moon.It was so dferent for me. I love living in the country, Irsquom a country boy, but I have very fond memories from Glasgow.Irsquove had great fun in Glasgow, with the festivals and the shows that Irsquove done ndash but a couple of night ago I played in Crieff, the night before that up in Findhorn on the north coast, and on Stornoway at An Laantair ndash it was fantastic.Irsquom a very positive person, I like all kinds of music, I like the creative process.The last couple of years Irsquove been doing solo concerts, Irsquove ed back to the essence of what I do.Irsquove done a lot of collaborating, Irsquove done orchestra stuff, with bands and things, but now Irsquom doing these shows solo and itrsquos great because I get this relationship with the audience going which you just canrsquot get in collaboration.I love that, I tell stories and get the audience to sing, I love that side of what I do.This weekendrsquos show at the Royal Concert Hall will be a bit like that, I donrsquot like formal concerts, itrsquos a Dougie Maclean concert with a bunch of my songs and a bunch of my stories and a bit of whistle here, a bit of bagpipes there, it is a great privilege to be asked to come down and be part of it.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON FILMING HIS LIFE STORYThe whole world is changing. I do a wee bit of photography and video.Irsquom in the process of cataloguing my le in video for the kids.My son has got his drone licence, Irsquove got a drone, my video cameras, my GoPros and Irsquom going to go out and visit all the places I grew up in.If I wait about trying to get the media to do it, theyrsquore not interested in me at all, then there will be no record of what Irsquove done, my le, unless I do it myself.I enjoy it, itrsquos for my grandkids, not really for anything .Buttherersquos any other value, then therersquos a big old internet out there, so people will be able to see it for themselves.DOUGIE MACLEAN TURNS  YEARS OLD ON HIS BIRTHDAY IN SEPTEMBERIrsquom busier this year than Irsquove ever been. Irsquove just come back from Europe. But people say to me ndash when are you going to retire But I remember a famous American actor said, lsquoIf yoursquove got a job, you retire,itrsquos your workndash you just keep doing itrsquo and I thought that was a quite good way of describing what I do.As long as Irsquove got a voice and I can drive and travel, Irsquoll keep on doing it.I love the people, Irsquove got a fantastic group of fans who appreciate what I do, who will come to my shows, and are great fun to be with for an evening.There are two paths you can take as a musicianyou want your face on the front of Q magazine, you sign a deal with a big, major record company, then you might have a bit of fame for two or three years, then you go back to being a taxi driver.Oryou just enjoy playing music, you set up your own independent publishing label, and you go out and do gigs, all kinds of gigs, and thatrsquos whatrsquos been lucky with me.Irsquove managed to have this longevity ndash Irsquom turning  as you say ndash and I think Irsquom getting better as I get older.Even my own songs I sang  years ago Irsquom doing better now for some reason, with that older gravitas that you get.Therersquos something about not being stressed out about it all.Irsquom not at that place in my le where Irsquom worried about reviews, every year I have now is a bonus for me. Irsquove got my family and the kids, Irsquove paid off my house, Irsquom in a good place.Itrsquos an amazing place to be as a musician."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10272102.jpg?type=article-full","title":"1m-whisky-sauce-e-made-country-fair","story":"Foodies and whisky aficionados can delight their taste buds when the one-of-a-kind whisky sauce is served at Galloway Country Fair this weekend.The sauce, made from cask number one of Annandale Distilleryrsquos first unpeated single malt Man orsquo Word, will be used for a recipe in the Fairrsquos Galloway Demo Kitchen.This will be the first and only use of the whisky, named after Robert Burns, before it is out away to mature for a decade.

The PLA, Chinarsquos Peoplersquos Liberation Army, the video is suggesting, is not far away.

It is  years since Communist hardliners used the army to put down the Tiananmen Square Protests in Beijing.So far mass protesters in Hong Kong have only come in to conflict with local riot police .Local police are accountable to authorities in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region rather than, directly, to Beijing. They have clashed with protestors, some of whom believe they are already under attack by mainland security agents. That provoked some of the ugliest scenes yet - at Hong Airport this week.Police said they tried to help ambulance officers reach an injured man whom protesters had detained on suspicion of being an undercover agent.

After all, there is a big dference between firing rubber bullets at a crowd and murdering civilians.ldquoThis means that China would have to deploy the PLA garrison or transfer tens of thousands of paramilitary soldiers rom the mainland.ldquoHong Kongrsquos residents would almost certainly treat Chinese government forces as invaders, and mount the fiercest possible resistance.ldquoThe resulting clashes ndash which would likely produce high numbers of civilian casualties ndash would mark the official end of the lsquoone country, two systemsrsquo arrangement, with Chinarsquos government forced to assert direct and full control over Hong Kongrsquos administration.The stakes, then, could not be higher.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Richard Leonard hadn’t got the memo. He rushed out a release restating his own take on party policy, but still the sht was reasserted by Corbyn’s right-hand man.Bizarrely, it suggests a further extension of the policy that cost Labour so heavily at the European election: the doctrine of ‘constructive ambiguity’.: John McDonnell owes Richard Leonard apology over thoughtless independence ramblings – Ian Murray MP: Three weeks of Boris Johnson - and Scotland has had enoughIt’s a bit of a mouthful but constructive ambiguity basically boils down to trying to play both sides at once. Initially it only applied to Brexit. It stood as a means of triangulating a position which would please both their Leave-voting constituencies in England and reassure their Remain voters in ­metropolitan London and university towns. It failed. Spectacularly.Labour learned the hard way that, when it comes to constitutional politics, you cannot ride both horses. They had tried to convince Leave voters that they were a party wedded to honouring the referendum result whilst simultaneously reassuring Remainers that they were going to block Brexit. They forgot one key factor: both groups were hearing both sets of ­messages and didn’t believe either.The softening of their policy towards a second indyref feels like the same gambit, trying to appeal to Yes voters whilst maintaining an ostensibly pro-UK  to retain their pro-Union supporters. Without an urgent course correction, it could bring about their ruin.Over the past four years, Labour have been quietly conducting a post-mortem into why they were all but wiped out in Scotland in the  ­general election. They believe they came adrt of substantial ­sections of their base when the SNP started to win over traditional Labour demographics to the Yes cause. That feeling that “Labour isn’t on my side” was compounded, they believe, by images of Labour politicians sharing ­s with the old enemy – the Conservative Party.The result of that post-mortem was a two-stage policy sht, the first, uttered several times in recent months, that Labour would not campaign alongside the Conservatives in any future independence referendum. The second was the withdrawal of hostility to that referendum at Westminster.There are already huge signs that this isn’t playing well among their remaining supporters. After offending their ultra-Remain core with ambiguity over Brexit, they are causing equal or even graver offence to the substantial wing of the party who loathe the ision that will come with a second border poll.Moderate Labour activists stared on in disbelief. That reaction was elegantly captured by Duncan Hothersall, a respected Labour activist and blogger, when he described his party in Scotland as the political equivalent of a ghost in the movie The Sixth Sense – “Most people don’t even notice it, and it doesn’t realise it’s already dead.”Several journalists have already told me of their private expectations that my own party, the Lib Dems will benefit handsomely from being the only party to stand full square behind Scotland’s place in the UK and Scotland’s place in the EU.That may be the case, but I take no pleasure in Labour’s sht. A plurality of voices making the positive case for our place in both unions is absolutely vitalwe are to save either.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

the work carried out with a stunning video.Spearheaded by Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, phase two of the Gilford Riverside Trail was funded with cash from the SOARVillage Renewal Measure.Walkers and cyclists across the Borough will soon have the chance to meander down a picturesque pathway alongside the beautul Bann River in Gilford, thanks to funding of £, from SOAR .Phase  was completed in  at Stramore Park and Phase  will connect these lands to Woodlands Park by the creation of an m riverside walking and cycling trail.The project has involved the creation of a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and the construction of a new footbridge across the millrace linking the trail to Woodlands Park.The route passes over part of the old mill race and land between the river and the in-filled mill pond.Sharing their video on social media AG Wilson said: “As the Gilford Riverside Trail project nears completion, we are excited to share a sneak

rediscovered","story":"A CLONARD parishioner has rediscovered a fascinating book of religious art that dates to the early s.-year-old Fred Brady bought the dusty tome from a market in Kildare over -years ago, and it had lain forgotten in his attic for decades.Published in  by the now seemingly defunct Catholic Picture Company of Ireland, the book includes high-quality prints of the Stations of the Cross, which depict the crucixion of Jesus Christ.While largely an artistic work, the book offers some detail of its publication. The book states that “being the nineteenth century of the Redemption of mankind” the then Pope, Pius XI, had proclaimed  a “Holy Year”.“These facts have prompted the publishers to devise and reproduce this beautul and artistic Album containing the fourteen ‘Stations of the Cross’,” it states.“The primary purpose of the work of Irish Art is to provide a most appropriate and lasting souvenir for the Catholic home, in honour and commemoration of Holy Year.”It also reveals that the artworks are “exact replicas of the celebrated and valuable set in the Church of Mount Alphonsus, Limerick”, which belonged to the Redemptorist Fathers, who gave permission for their reproduction.According to the Redemptorists in Limerick, the Stations of the Cross in their church date back to  – just four years after the church was officially completed.Explaining his find, Fred said: “I bought it in a massive market in Kildare. I’m  now, so I would say it was about  years ago, maybe more.“I liked it because it was the Stations of the Cross and I thought it maybe would be worth a few bob in a lot of years’ time, but I never tried to sell it or do anything with it. It was exactly like that when I bought it so it was a good few years old then.“I just found it up in the attic of the house. I was clearing the attic out because we’re changing over from oil to gas and I came across it again.”He continued: “I just want to see what’s what with it.

Back in the day, the Lansdowne Court Hotel was the place to go in Belfast. In the past year or so, the place had become a bit tired and it was put up for sale. I see it as a great opportunity to restore it to its glory days and bring something to the people of the Antrim Road and North Belfast.”Jim and his co-owners have put a lot of money into the refurbishment and he is very pleased the way the stunning new premises have turned out.“It is the city centre on the Antrim Road,” he added. “Everything is top class from the drink, food, garden and bridal suite. We have invested heavily and also boast around  staff so it is great to bring jobs to the local community.“When we bought it last March, we thought it was going to be a quick refurb and it would be opened for Christmas but the further we looked at it, it wasn’t going to be a quick turnaround.“We wanted to do things right and we are very pleased with the way it has turned out.”Jim is hoping the eye-catching new surroundings and features of the Landsdowne will bring people through the door – and he hopes to bring his expertise to the project.“Our support from the local community to date has been second to none since we opened seven weeks ago.“Customers have been very welcoming to me and I want to welcome them too.“I am here every day as the face on the floor. My background is in s and food so I hope to bring a fair bit to the table knowledge-wise.“For anyone who hasn’t been yet, come and try us – you will not be disappointed!“We are open to suggestions for anything that can be improved.“The bridal suite is stunning. It is the only room that hasn’t been used yet but there are a number of weddings booked for later in the year.“The garden has been there over  years.“We have invested a bit of money in it for people to sit and relax, enjoy a bit of food and drink.“We also put a lot of thought into the food. It is served both in the restaurant and bar. The small plates are proving a huge hit with customers.“We think our food is top end and we are not charging top end prices.”“It is a pleasure to be here. I am really excited about the Lansdowne,” he added.The Lansdowne Hotel Antrim RoadBelfast BT EFTel:    www.thelansdownehotel"},{"url":null,"title":"bernadette mcaliskey who in their right mind would vote to join the free state","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support.

I also felt guilty that I didnt know what was going on, and there and then I decided Id better find out what it was all about.\"Taylor tonight broadcasts a previously unseen interview with a man who was said to have been the commander of the Derry brigade of the IRA on Bloody Sunday.The man, whose face is blurred, says the IRA played no part in the civil rights march and took all their weapons out of the area.Asked by Taylor what Bloody Sunday had done for IRA recruitment, the man replies: \"I would saywe had the facilities we could recruit the majority of the Bogside.\"Looking back from , Taylor says: \"If I had been a teenager that day on Bloody Sunday I probably would have joined the IRA. I would have considered taking that final step, which is what happened to hundreds of young Catholics, men and women.\"Taylor says that he thinks Bloody Sunday legitimised violence in the minds of many people who believed thatthe State could use violence against them, they would use violence against the State.Taylor says that as he looked at the bodies of the Bloody Sunday victims in a church, John Hume told him the person he should talk to was Martin McGuinness, whom he did interview and quickly assessed to be a \"natural leader who was very articulate, charismatic and friendly\".\"He looked you straight in the eye and he had eyes that could be friendly and warm and welcoming and he also had eyes that could be hard as iron,\" Taylor adds.He says that in his opinion McGuinness came to be the single most important IRA leader on the island of Ireland, a man who was \"charming and ruthless\", and who would go on to meet the Queen.Taylor continues: \"In the end he was somebody I came to admire, as did many of his fiercest critics because of the journey he made from war.\"After Bloody Sunday Taylor went on patrol with the Army in , the most violent year of the Troubles, and he is heard asking soldiersthey are biased against Catholics. One of them says it isnt possible to be neutral because of the dferent reactions the Army receive in loyalist and republican areas.One soldier says that most of his colleagues \"on seeing their mates shot would love to punch the f*** out of some Paddy\".Taylor says that many of the soldiers, not all of them, hated the Catholic community that they believed supported and harboured the IRA.Some of the footage in Taylors latest documentary is of the fledgling UDA after they set up no-go areas in response to similar moves by the IRA in the early Seventies.He says he understood why loyalists thought their heritage was under threat \"and they had good reason to fear that\".He also recalls how the \"bulwark of loyalism\", the Rev Ian Paisley, once told him to \"get you back\" to England, but how the \"funny, charming and irresistible\" politician later bought ice-creams for him and his crew.Taylor says his discovery in the s that terror suspects were being abused by the security forces at interrogation centres including Castlereagh shocked himHe adds: \"I really felt outraged by what I was convinced was happening. I got confirmation from all the main sources, apart from the police, who were denying it was happening.\"It was around that time in the Seventies that Taylor claims the Northern Ireland Office \"presumably encouraged by the Secretary of State Roy Mason\" said he was doing programmes that were unhelpful to the security forces who suggested that his bosses should get another reporter to cover the situation.Taylor says: \"I felt very exposed. It makes you think - have I got this right  And you conclude yes.\"He also deals with the IRA prisoners dirty protest and the resultant hunger strikes over political status in the Maze and how, against the advice of the NIO, Desmond Irvine, the secretary of the Prison Officers Association, gave him an interview in which he talked of the respect he had for the Provos for their protest.Two weeks later Mr Irvine was shot dead by the IRA and Taylor, who says he felt sick at being indirectly implicated in a murder, was asked by a journalist how he felt about having \"blood on his hands\".Taylor says he was in tears at Mr Irvines funeral and admits he considered stopping covering Northern Ireland, but decided to carry on with his work.He says Bobby Sands martyred himself for the cause and the hunger strike showed that the IRA had a reservoir of support, which built the  for the rise of Sinn Fein over the next decade.\"The Iron Lady met the Iron Men and the Iron Men won,\" he says, adding that in the Eighties after the hunger strikes neither the British Government nor the IRA were prepared to compromise, something the Provos illustrated with their attempt to assassinate Mrs Thatcher with the Brighton bomb.Back in Northern Ireland, Taylor says a killing which affected him deeply was that of teenager John Boyle, who was shot dead in  by the SAS the day after his Catholic father alerted the security forces that his son had stumbled on an arms cache in a graveyard in Dunloy.Taylor says Mr Con Boyle went to his grave without ever receiving an apology, adding: \"Its a small thing but its the least that should happen when these tragedies happen, its the least the family deserves.\"However, Taylor says that the SAS and their sister intelligence unit called The Det played a crucial role in what he dubbed the \"secret war against the Provos\" using a range of weapons including surveillance which could even tell the British what the terrorists were having for breakfast.In an interview for one of Taylors earlier documentaries, the late IRA leader Brendan Hughes tells the broadcaster the technology effectively brought the IRA to a standstill where they could move very, very little, and \"contained\" the organisation.Taylor says he was shocked when he found out that the security forces had been helping loyalists in what he called the \"dirty war\".He replays an interview with convicted UFF terrorist Bobby Philpott, in which he says he was getting so many intelligence documents for targeting republicans that he didnt know where to put them, and claims the information went right down to the colour of socks they were wearing.Taylor deals briefly with atrocities like the Enniskillen massacre, Michael Stones Milltown cemetery attack, Loughinisland, Warrington and the Corporals killings in Andersonstown and says he got a sense that all sides were growing weary of the violence.The documentary also focuses on Taylors coverage of moves by the British Government to persuade the IRA to call a halt to their violence.He revisits interviews with one-time MI officers Frank Steele and Michael Oatley and with an emotional Brendan Duddy, the Derry businessman who was used as a \"secret peacemaker\", liaising between the British and the IRA, who both realised they could not win the war.And Brendan Hughes is heard telling the broadcaster that the war is over.Taylor marvels at Ian Paisley taking office as Northern Irelands First Minister, and though he says the peace of today is not perfect, it is \"certainly better than what we all went through for all those awful, bloody, desperate years\".Taylor says no one apart from dissidents wants to go back to those years of violence.But he says another major outstanding issue remains - how to deal with the past, in particular the prosecution of soldiers, like Soldier F, for killings including Bloody Sunday.Taylor says he thinks the law must take its course.Towards the end of the documentary he addresses the question of the border and predicts: \"In the long tunnel of history a united Ireland is perhaps more likely than not.\"But he adds: \"That will only happenunionists are party to it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"service marks 50 years since army deployed to streets of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

their respects to the , military personnel who died on active duty during the deployment, which lasted almost  years.The service, organised by the Royal British Legion, took place amid tight security at a rain-swept National Memorial Arboretum.It comes as a number of contentious cases make their way through the courts and amid continuing legacy investigations into British military personnel, with some veterans complaining of a witch hunt.The operation to send troops to Northern Ireland, between August   to July  , to tackle inter-community violence would become the longest continuous deployment in modern British military history.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A lone musician plays The Last Post at the service to remember those who served All the names of those who died are inscribed on the while Portland stone of the commanding Armed Forces Memorial, which marks the centrepiece of the arboretum at Alrewas, Staffordshire.In the course of the operation,  military personnel died in paramilitary attacks, and  from other causes.Of those killed by terrorist attacks, more than a quarter served with the Ulster Defence Regiment, which recruited directly from Northern Ireland.Over the years, more than , personnel were deployed in total over the course of the whole operation.I think that is something to be proud of and it is also time to remember many of the people today who lost their lives doing it.Defence Secretary Ben WallaceMr Wallace, who served in Northern Ireland with the Scots Guards in the s, said: “Northern Ireland, Operation Banner,  years ago, was a success.“It was a military deployment in support of civilian powers and the police, to make sure we saw off the threat of terrorism and the attacks that were going on.“In order to defend both communities, it wasn’t a one-sided affair, there were people being intimidated in the Nationalist community by terrorists and people in the loyalist community.“And Op Banner, in the end, drove a terrorist organisation pretty much out of business – many of them in prison.“It allowed space to be created for a political solution to The Troubles that had lasted for a very long time.“I think that is something to be proud of and it is also time to remember many of the people today who lost their lives doing it.”He added: “It’s a great success story.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  British troops on the streets of Belfast in August  Later, the Defence Secretary, who lost two comrades killed during his first tour of Northern Ireland in , responded to veterans’ concerns over prosecutions.He referred to legal claims against British forces in Afghanistan and Iran “which in the end turned out to be almost nothing whatsoever”.He said: “We’ve got to look at some of those lessons and see what  we can do in Northern Ireland to make sure we treat veterans with dignity and make sure the fishing trips we’ve seen in the past, where in the end no real evidence has been produced, is not being used to drive a constant re-writing of history that somehow actually the British Army was the bad guys.“When in fact the reality was the terrorists who intimidated and bombed and killed thousands of people in Northern Ireland in that time, they’re the ones who should really be held to account and we should do more to find them.”He also said he did not support an amnesty for those who had murdered British service personnel, but said there was “space for reconciliation”.Asked what the long-term solution to the legacy of such investigations was, he said: “I’d like a legal solution.“I’d like to see a solution that doesn’t just let off the hook a whole load of terrorists because, in the end, an amnesty would be saying that.”He added: “It’s not straightforward whether it’s an amnesty, and the statute of limitations can be legally challenged at some levels.”Mr Wallace was speaking after a service remembering those who made the ultimate sacrice, and included accounts from former Royal Ulster Constabulary, Army and firefighting personnel, often first at the scene to rescue people trapped in bomb-blasted buildings."},{"url":null,"title":"with each passing

Nor did they find any footprints inside the villa or forensic evidence to suggest an unknown person was inside.More than  officers had joined the search for Nora by August  and her grandfather Sylvain Quoirin, mayor of Venizy in north-central France, said it was \"unthinkable\" that she had wandered off alone. As the search intensied, more details emerged about the family.It was reported that the Quoirins are an Irish-French family who have lived in London for  years.Mea­bh is chief executive of a consumer analytics company there.Four days after the teen went missing, officials hunting for her in the dense jungle played a heartbreaking recording of Noras mum calling \"Nora, Nora darling, mummys here\" through loudspeakers in an attempt to reach her.Mrs Quoirin reached out in a statement describing her as \"a special person\" who is \"fun, funny and extremely loving\" as the frantic search for Nora continued, adding: \"She is not like other teenagers. She is not independent and does not go anywhere alone.\"Both parents also thanked the search teams helping to look for their eldest daughter, saying \"it means the world to us. We are so grateful for everything that you are doing for us\".On August , Malaysian police set up a hotline dedicated to receiving information about Nora and two days ago a £, reward, donated by an anonymous Belfast business, was announced for information leading to Noras safe .Appearing before cameras on Monday, a tearful Ms Quoirin said: \"Nora is our first child. She has been vulnerable since the day she was born.\"She is so precious to us and our hearts are breaking.\"Yesterday saw a devastating conclusion to the familys horric ordeal as their hopes of finding Nora alive ended at a waterfall the young girl was said to have been excited about seeing when she arrived in the resort.But, for the Quoirins, there will be no end to the devastation or the grief that was visited upon their lives during a brief stay at a remote eco-resort that robbed them of their bright future with their precious daughter."},{"url":null,"title":"house prices increase by 2 in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead he used the power of his office to reward his supporters and punish his critics. He is now the only PM in history to be found guilty of breaking federal ethics law not once, but twice. Trudeau is not as advertised. pic RkQcUomqN— Andrew ScheerAugust , “The prime minister, directly and through his senior officials, used ious means to exert influence over Ms Wilson-Raybould,” Mr Dion wrote.“The authority of the prime minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the director of public prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms Wilson-Raybould.”Ms Wilson-Raybould believes she was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister to veterans’ affairs minister in January because she didn’t give in to pressure to enter into a remediation agreement with a Canadian company accused of bribing officials in Libya.That potential solution would avoid a potential criminal conviction that would bar Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin from receiving any federal government business for a decade. directed his staff to find a solution that would safeguard SNC-Lavalins business interest in CanadaReportThe company is a major employer with , employees in Canada and about , worldwide.The report said Mr Trudeau “directed his staff to find a solution that would safeguard SNC-Lavalin’s business interest in Canada”.The scandal led to multiple resignations, including that of Gerry Butts, Mr Trudeau’s top aide and best friend.And it damaged the party for weeks.Opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer called SNC-Lavalin a “Liberal” linked corporation that defrauded some of the poorest people on earth.Mr Scheer said Mr Trudeau has not lived up to promises to be open and honest when he was elected.“Trudeau may not face a court of law for his role in this scandal, but he will have to face the Canadian people over the next few weeks,” Mr Scheer said.A spokesman for Mr Trudeau said he would issue a statement and take questions later."},{"url":null,"title":"new rules could restrict mount everest climbers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down.

A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During the Second World War the building was used as an auxiliary workshop. It changed hands in the early s to become Moorwell Motors.Ben Wells, managing director at Project Three, said: ldquoWe are delighted to reveal our plans to restore and revitalise this impressive Penarth building.ldquoWe were immediately struck by the strong architectural style of the faccedilade and the light and space inside. It was clear there was potential to design a scheme that would honour the buildingrsquos character and heritage, while creating something new and contemporary for future generations to enjoy.Features include double height windows in the duplex and both private and communal outside spaces. A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We learn about the Romans, World War Two, the American Civil War at school, but most people have never been taught about the history of their own country.ldquoWe have more castles than any other country in the world per square mile, and thatrsquos something worth celebrating.Fonmon Castle is a rarity among Welsh castles, uniquely well-suited to creating interactive events like jousting, workshops, Renaissance and Steampunk fairs, and many more.ldquoFonmon Castle is one of the few Welsh castles that is still lived in, explained Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoIt has remained within two families since it was built by the Marcher Lords during the Norman invasion.ldquoIt recently it was sold to a very friendly couple and they headhunted me in order to help them turn the castle around, to open it up to the public and help teach people more about Welsh history.ldquoTheyrsquove basically provided me a blank cheque. I want people to wake up in the mornings, and wonder lsquowhat shall we do today at Fonmon Castle rsquoThe first of these events, on Wednesday, August , will feature medieval re-enactments, living history displays, medieval combat lessons, have-a-go archery, childrenrsquos play areas and dino walks - and will be free.ldquoWe have so much history to offer as a country, said Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoI want to really start to show it off.To find out more, email info@fonmoncastle article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute.

For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster business top  launch ","story":"Posted on Wednesday  August  by Ulster Business Sarah Little, publishing director, INM NI, Mark Thompson, AL Goodbody with John Mulgrew The cream of Northern Ireland’s business community have gathered to mark the official launch of the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies , with AL Goodbody.
