Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland in midst of second omicron wave but no return of restrictions varadkar","story":"Tánaiste said Covid-19  case  numbers were ‘a cause for concern’ but not a  ‘cause for panic’. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Ireland is in the midst of another Covid-19 wave but restrictions will not be reimposed, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said.The Fine Gael leader also said that an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic could be set up within the next few months and would likely hear from senior figures, such as chief medical officer Tony Holohan.His comments came after Taoiseach Micheál Martin said over the weekend that he didn’t want a situation where senior personnel were looking over their shoulders in future while making key decisions during a crisis.The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 increased by 48 on Sunday, bringing the total number of patients being treated for the virus to 1,175, the highest number of hospitalisations since February of last year.“I think it is another wave,” Mr Varadkar said. “What’s happening across Europe now is a second wave of Omicron if you like.“But I don’t think it is going to require the reimposition of restrictions. About half of those in hospital with Covid would be in hospital anyway, it is an incidental finding in their cases.“Also because of the vaccines even though case numbers are high, the number of people getting sick, the number of people being hospitalised, requiring ICU treatment, thankfully the number of people dying, is very low.“This is another wave but we don’t anticipate it will necessitate the reimposition of restrictions.”Mr Varadkar said while the current case numbers were “a cause for concern” they were “not a cause for panic”. “We are monitoring the situation very tightly.”He said the Government is considering whether a fourth vaccine dose needs to be started for those who are elderly or medically vulnerable. He said the expectation is that a fourth dose would be recommended to commence “around the middle of the year” rather than closer to the end of the year.The Tánaiste also said that discussions have taken place on the planned inquiry into Ireland’s handling of the pandemic, but a decision has not yet been reached on the format.“We haven’t made a decision on the format of the inquiry yet. We do believe it is important that we have an inquiry into how the pandemic was handled in Ireland.“If you look at the numbers, Ireland has one of the lowest excess mortality rates in Europe and indeed the world and that says to us that we as a society did a lot of things right, but we did not do everything right and I think it’s important that we work out and establish what we did right and what we could have done better.”He said while the Government did not want to see senior figures “hauled over the coals”, it was envisaged that people who were involved in the response, including those in Government and in senior positions in the HSE and the Department of Health, would give evidence.Mr Varadkar said the inquiry was not about “getting” people but was to try to establish which decisions were correct and what could have been done better so we “could be better prepared for another pandemic if it happens in our lifetime”.“We would certainly envisage having the inquiry up and running this year, if not in the next couple of months.“One thing we do need to bear in mind is that many of the people who would be asking to take part in the inquiry to give evidence are also the people still battling the pandemic.“We don’t want them spending several days a week preparing statements and questions when we need them doing their frontline jobs.”Mr Varadkar was speaking at a national ceremony of remembrance and reflection which took place in Dublin in memory of all those who died during the pandemic.The ceremony, which was held in the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin City Centre, also paid tribute to those involved in safeguarding Ireland from Covid-19.Wreaths were laid by frontline healthcare workers, transport workers, volunteers, public health doctors and contact tracers among others.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd while putin shrinks zelenskiy soars","story":" Babushka dolls depicting Russian president Vladimir Putin  on sale in Athens, Greece. Photograph: Orestis PanagiotouEPAMyron Cohen, a garment district silk salesman turned popular comedian in the Ed Sullivan era, loved to tell this chestnut: Picture a skinny little guy, a shrimp, a nothing. He walks into a lumber camp looking for a job. The foreman is sceptical, so the shrimp steps up and fells a towering oak in 90 seconds. “Where’d you learn that?” says the foreman. “In the Sahara Forest,” replies the guy. “You mean the Sahara Desert,” the foreman corrects. “Sure, now,” the guy says. Hubris guided Vladimir Putin’s malevolent and maladroit invasion of Ukraine. As the Associated Press pointed out, US military officials assumed Russia would deploy electronic and cyber warfare to blind and paralyse Ukrainian air defences and communications. But the Russians did not take control of Ukrainian air space when they launched their attack.Putin was cocksure, dismissing Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a shrimp, a nothing. But Zelenskiy has shown the world what true stature is. Putin has always had a Napoleon complex, puffing out his bare chest on horseback fishing shirtless in Siberia winning staged judo and hockey displays. But Zelenskiy understands that stature is not about phoney macho photo shoots. Stature is a physical quality, but, more important, it is a human and moral quality. Keats was barely over 5 feet, but look at his spiritual size. Our military leaders have lately been quoting Napoleon, who said, “The moral is to the physical as three to one.” We have seen this with the Ukrainians, who are not only courageously resisting the Russians but also launching counteroffensives.Parking tanksAs the New York Times reported, the number of Russian casualties has hurt morale our intelligence reports have described Russian soldiers simply parking their tanks and wandering into the woods. Putin doesn’t realise what the world knows: You don’t show your muscularity by razing cities, by bombing a maternity hospital, a boarding school for the visually impaired, a bread line, a community centre and a shelter painted with a message in Russian pleading that children are inside. What kind of monster treats the word “CHILDREN” as an invitation to kill? This just proves that the Russian dictator is, as President Joe Biden and his secretary of state contended, a war criminal.You don’t show your power by starting a war that reveals how weak and mediocre your army is and strengthens European bonds when your goal is to ide and weaken Europe. No matter what happens in Ukraine, Putin will be a loser with no moral stature and Zelenskiy will have towering moral stature.Donald Trump, who called Putin’s barbaric strategy “genius” and “savvy” after spending four years legitimising that malefactor, also comes out a loser. Trump is stuck on the fringe of his party, sharing the wrong side of a moral ide with Tucker Carlson, JD Vance, Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Trump and Putin, what a pair, shrinking in stature in the eyes of the world. Tiny, tiny Trump and cruel fool Putin. The corrupt, paranoid germaphobes love surrounding themselves with sycophants, conjuring delusional worlds and giving unhinged rants.Putin let loose on those who question his misbegotten war: “Any people, and even more so the Russian people, will be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths. Spit out on the pavement.”He even went after his pals, the oligarchs, “who can’t do without foie gras, oysters or the so-called gender freedoms” in Miami or the French Riviera. Sowing seedsTrump and Putin sowed the seeds of their own destruction. They wanted all of the attention and credit. Now they deserve all of the blame. Grandiosity and fantasy worlds will trip up these poisonous authoritarians. Neither man has a democratic bone in his body. And both think they know better than anyone else. “When you have an autocrat who’s been in power for too long, they don’t listen to people anymore, and this war was afflicted by very bad decision making,” Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian who teaches at New York University, said on MSNBC. This has left Putin vulnerable and humiliated before Russian elites and the world, she said. But it has also, parlously, left him without an off-ramp “because autocrats don’t negotiate”.Stephen Kotkin, a professor of history and international affairs at Princeton, told the New Yorker’s David Remnick that the Russians have a fractured identity. Culturally and scientifically, they are a world-class power. But economically and politically, they have a hard time matching the West, so “they resort to coercion”.“The worst part of this dynamic in Russian history is the conflation of the Russian state with some personal ruler,” Kotkin said. “Instead of getting the strong state that they want to manage the gulf with the West, they instead get a personalist regime. They get a dictatorship, which usually becomes a despotism.”Zelenskiy spoke to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday, comparing the terror in Ukrainian skies to the death hailed down from the skies on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and on New York and Washington on 911. He also showed a devastating video that brought tears to lawmakers’ eyes.Underlining his role as David to Putin’s Goliath, Zelenskiy said, “Strong doesn’t mean big.” Strong means supporting human rights and freedom and demanding the right to die when “your time comes and not when it’s wanted by someone else, by your neighbour”. – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesFull coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Phenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"russell brand became mad hatter conspiracy theories","story":"The mockney messiah with a man bun has found a new calling. Russell Brand, formerly known for stand-up comedy, hosting reality shows and making incendiary phone calls about granddaughters of Fawlty Towers actors, can now be found posting ‘truth-seeking’ daily videos and weekly podcasts to some 10m people across YouTube and Instagram. Recent episodes include ‘You’ve Been LIED To About Why Ukraine War Began’ ‘Can We REALLY Trust Vaccine Fact-Checkers??!’, and ‘Trump was RIGHT About Clinton \u0026amp Russia Collusion!!’. It’s all a far cry from the man three times named ‘S------ of the Year’ by The Sun.The charismatic Brand, who became ubiquitous in the mid-Noughties, has harnessed his popularity into virtual populism, his ‘anti-partisan’ videos winning millions of fans across both Left and Right. The 15-minute posts usually begin with thanks to “awakened beings” for joining the “journey to truth” he has defended both Putin and Trump, decries billionaires, and wants to root out racism. Brand detests authority – mass media and the Government being the primary evils – and wants revolution. So much so that he wrote a book of that name in 2014 (from the country pile of his then-girlfriend, heiress Jemima Khan).Seemingly modelling himself on Joe Rogan – the controversial US podcasting phenom who followed the stand-up to reality presenter to populist pundit pipeline to become one of the most powerful figures in American media – Brand promises to “say the unsayable”, earning himself a loyal, and large, following. The 46-year-old says he is not there to flout conspiracy theories, but to ask questions and “create new narratives” – a similar defence employed by Rogan, who in January found himself at the centre of a scandal after being accused of peddling Covid mistruths.One episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 11m listeners, resulted in a letter from more than 270 doctors slamming the programme as a “menace to public health”. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell told Spotify, the platform on which his podcast is streamed, that it had to ditch Rogan or their back catalogues Rogan won out. The brouhaha only solidified the status that the podcasting behemoths now wield – which is good news for brand Brand.There are major differences in their approaches, however. While both are martial arts fans keen to host isive figures – Rogan’s include ex-NRA leader and Sandy Hook-denier Alex Jones, academic Jordan Peterson and Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-Right Proud Boys group – the US presenter’s hours-long conversations belie a genuine desire to find what makes his interviewees tick. Brand is a different beast, his videos a stream of verbal ablutions that begin with a plea for viewers to buy tickets to his live tour (his T-shirts bearing anti-Government slogans sell for £25.99). ‘Stay Free’ is splashed across merch from tea towels to phone cases and mugs, the latter of which also features his face. His site promises that “grants using money generated by this endeavour” will be made, though no further details are provided.Brand – an avowed anti-capitalist with a net worth over £10m, according to Spear’s – was criticised for his 2017 book Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions, which some said was a for-profit version of the 12-step programme used for alcohol and drug addicts (which is available for free). “The point is that you don’t profit from the 12 steps,” says an insider who knew Brand as his star was rising that is “really frowned upon”. But he’s “very funny, he’s very charming,” she admits. “When I was with him, I felt like I was the only person in the world.”It is this “incredible ability to make people feel as though he’s talking just to them” that has supercharged his online success. “This is what it feels like to be part of a conversation,” he tells viewers in a video posted this week: “to be heard, to be seen.”Henry Jeffreys saw that appeal up close in 2007, when working as a publicist for My Booky Wook – Brand’s sex and drink-fuelled memoir. “People loved him,” he recalls of Brand’s effusive chats with old ladies and security guards. Back then, Brand was a household name, thanks to hosting E4’s spin-off show Big Brother’s Big Mouth, appearing in Hollywood films from Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Get Him to the Greek, and tabloid-documented liaisons with Kate Moss, Sadie Frost, Geri Halliwell (and many, many more).By the middle of the last decade, Brand had interviewed Holocaust-denier David Icke on multiple occasions and, in 2015, invited the would-be Labour leader Ed Miliband on his YouTube show, The Trews (a portmanteau of True News), so great was his appeal among young voters deemed to be by politicians. Brand, at the time, was not registered to vote.“There are particular iniduals within the anti-vaccine world who are amenable to pro-Russian propaganda,” according to Imran Ahmed, executive director of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, who notes that there is also crossover among supporters of QAnon (the group who believed Trump was fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles across the government, media and corporate worlds). Rather than these groups fading with Covid, experts warn that the same mindset – dismissing the prevailing logic so as to deny the status quo, no matter the evidence – will merely be transferred to other crises.This has also led to hybrid conspiracies: such as that the US has long had a secret, illegitimate bioweapons lab in Ukraine, which now works with bat-borne coronavirus samples, which Russia is simply attempting to destroy.Brand never clearly nails down his own views, “discussing” conspiracies, so as to skirt accusations of being a conspiracist. He is helped somewhat by those who still associate him with his cheeky Noughties screen persona and former marriage to pop star Katy Perry, as well as his quest for wellness – the subject of another of his YouTube channels – and faithful practise of yoga and veganism, all of which obfuscate possible sightings of tin foil hats.He is currently touring the UK with ‘The 33’, which consists of three segments – his back story, the hypocrisy of the Government during the pandemic, and a meditation with the crowd. An Instagram post from Monday’s show in Sheffield features him clasping the hands of an audience member, as others watch on in wonder at what Brand called “a magical meeting of souls”.Rogan’s brand remains more steak and dumbbells than spinach and savasanas. But the pair share a great deal: both are “funny and fearless”, says listener Jon Miltimore, 42, who appreciates their ability to “talk intelligently about complex ideas and provocative ideas” these are men who aren’t “afraid to poke at those sacred cows, and to question authority”.They share mutual affection, too. “You’ve emerged authentically,” Rogan told his British counterpart during a marathon three-and-a-half-hour episode of his podcast in 2019. “This is who you really are… you found yourself.”Brand – who posted videos of support over Rogan’s Spotify debacle earlier this year – also cited him in his 2019 book, Mentors, in a nod to his “influence and impact.” With a net worth of around £92m, Rogan is still around 10 times bigger than Brand – but with his YouTube subscribers climbing by a million in a month, that gap may yet be closing.My Booky Wook was a bestseller My Conspiracy Wiracy is looking like a dead cert.More from NewsChina plane crash: Boeing 737 carrying 132 has \u0026#39accident\u0026#39 in Guangxi mountainsPolitics latest news: Go further in cutting fuel duty, senior Tories urge Rishi SunakRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine rejects Russian demands to surrender MariupolUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as shelling kills at least eight in KyivMonday morning news briefing: Russia accused of mass abductionsUp to five million now eligible to book Covid spring booster jabsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"airbrushing childrens lockdown experiences covid inquiry shocking","story":"The Covid inquiry has been accused of a “shocking oversight” after children were not directly mentioned in its aims.The draft terms of reference for the inquiry have been published, but include just one reference to education and the words “child” or “children” are not used.Anne Longfield, chairman of the Commission on Young Lives and former Children’s Commissioner for England, described it as a “shocking oversight”.“It does completely feel that the people who were at the forefront of both making the sacrifices but also suffering because of the pandemic have just been airbrushed out of memory with it,” she told The .The  has been running a campaign calling on ministers to put children first as the country recovers from its Covid lockdowns.The terms of reference, which are being consulted on until early April, state that: “The inquiry will examine, consider and report on preparations and the response to the pandemic in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.”It adds that the inquiry will examine the consequences of 16 topics, ranging from “preparedness and resilience” to “prisons and other places of detention” - and including “restrictions on attendance at places of education”.It comes after a group of MPs, led by the chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee, Robert Halfon, called for the closure of schools to form a “significant part” of the Covid inquiry.In a letter sent to the inquiry’s chair, Baroness Heather Hallett, the MPs also asked for the impact of the pandemic on young people’s mental health and on their “life chances” to be considered.Molly Kingsley, co-founder of the parents\u0027 campaign group UsForThem, said that not including any mention of children in the terms of reference for the inquiry was “insulting” and “indicative of the very serious structural failing when it comes to children”.She said the group is now calling for a separate children’s inquiry to be conducted, adding: “All of these measures really had a very damaging impact on a healthy paediatric population and to many of us that is actually the antithesis of public health.”“There’s no group that has been more disproportionately burdened than children and the impact of the pandemic response will live with children for the rest of their lives, so it’s absolutely critical that they are included in the inquiry,” she told The .“I don’t understand how it’s got this far without the word children,” Ms Kingsley said, adding that the impact on young people has been “so severe and so indiscriminate”.Ms Longfield added: “We are already seeing the repercussions in terms of the extent that some children are behind in their learning… but also in terms of mental health, which we know has plummeted as a result of the pandemic.“The fact that there are over 100,000 children that haven’t returned to school yet and some of those suffering such chronic anxiety that they barely dare go and out of the home and talk to anyone that\u0027s not their own parents is one that we need to not only feel responsible for, but also ensure that it never happens again, which is what an inquiry should be around.”Official figures released last week showed a record number of children were referred for specialist mental health help last year, with more than a million seeking help - a 26 per cent increase in only two years.The public engagement and consultation period for the Covid inquiry is expected to last for a total of four weeks and Baroness Hallett will determine the precise details of her investigative approach as the inquiry’s chair.The public is able to submit responses on the UK Covid-19 Inquiry website until midnight on April 7.The Cabinet Office declined to comment.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Go further in cutting fuel duty, senior Tories urge Rishi SunakRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine rejects Russian demands to surrender MariupolChina plane crash: Boeing 737 carrying 132 has \u0026#39accident\u0026#39 in Guangxi mountainsUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as shelling kills at least eight in KyivMonday morning news briefing: Russia accused of mass abductionsUp to five million now eligible to book Covid spring booster jabsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"monday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"It is a technique borrowed from the Nazi playbook. Vladimir Putin is accused of abducting and deporting thousands of civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and transporting them deep inside Russia. Ukrainian authorities alleged Russian forces had rounded up several thousand residents from the shattered port before sending them to remote cities hundreds of miles from the border. Russian state media broadcast clips of hundreds of Ukrainians it said had been rescued from the Black Sea port and evacuated eastward to safety in Russian cities. But Ukrainian officials said the people - clutching bags of possessions, dazed children and confused pets - had been forced to travel. Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko said the deportations echoed historic transportations. What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people, he said. And Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky likened Russia\u0027s invasion to Hitler\u0027s final solution.Russia correspondent Nataliya Vasilyeva has our report on the Kremlin\u0027s strategy.Mariupol has been shattered by bombardment and cut off from power, water and food deliveries for three weeks. Last night, Moscow gave Ukraine a deadline to surrender Mariupol as gun battles raged in the city of nearly half a million people. The Russian defence ministry said Ukrainian and foreign armed units must drop their weapons without exception and leave by 9am UK time today. Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine\u0027s deputy prime minister, insisted early today that Ukraine will not lay down arms.

The Government has announced that certain sections of the population will be able to sign up for a second booster from this week. The move comes almost exactly two years on from the first coronavirus lockdown in the UK, and against a worsening domestic pandemic picture. A new, more infectious strain is spreading and case rates are up.On Saturday Boris Johnson teased the latest vaccine drive at the Conservative Partyaposs Spring conference - and hinted itaposll be extended to more people later on this year.He said: I hope youaposve all had your boosters. Weaposre getting ready for a fourth jab, because weaposre going to need it. And Health Secretary Sajid Javid today said there will be more boosters “probably for those who are  or over” later this year. Here is everything you need to know about the fourth jab: When does the rollout begin  As of today the NHS has started inviting eligible people to come forward for their le-saving Spring booster jabs.Those who fit the bill have been able to to book from am.Who is eligible now  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised a spring jab should be offered to those most vulnerable to Covid- as a precautionary measure.People aged  and over and those who are immunosuppressed over the age of . In total five million people will be able to get a jab during the Spring booster campaign. The NHS will be contacting over , people to invite them to book their vaccine this week. You become eligible when you hit six months since your last booster, which is why not everyone is available straight away. For most of them it will be the fourth dose, though for immunosuppressed people it might be the fth. Who might become eligible in future The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationis still debating whether to extend fourth doses more widely.Last week Health Secretary Sajid Javid gave the strongest hint yet that there will definitely be a wider rollout.But is understood no decisions have been made about who exactly would get the jab as part of this. I.e. whether to offer a fourth jab to all adults - or, instead, widen access but still keep it to certain groups such as the over-s. Today Mr Javid emphasised the JCVI have said theyaposre looking at an Autumn dose for over-s, but with no decision yet. Askedthe JCVI would say we needed more people jabbed, Mr Javid told ITVaposs Peston: I think at some point they will. And theyaposve actually been clear and their most recent advice is that they think that towards the end of this year, maybe in the autumn, there will be a need to give a lot more people a boost, an offer of a boost. But Iaposll wait for that advice.Why is the government rolling this out now Coronavirus cases and hospitalisations are on the up, and experts fear that deaths could soon begin to rise as well. Since the beginning of the month daily infections have more than doubled, from , cases a day on average per week, to , now. At the moment case rates among the elderly are at a record high, with one in  people over  in England infected. Although the vaccine has helped to keep the impact of those infections lower than in  and the start of , hospitalisation rates are now rising again. There are currently about , Covid admissions a day across the UK - a % rise on this time a month ago. The rise is being fuelled by more social interactions and BA., a new a mutation of the Omicron iant of coronavirus that accounts for the majority of new infections in the UK.Nikki Kanani, GP and Deputy SRO for the NHS COVID Vaccination Programme, said: “Sadly, we are still seeing large numbers of people seriously unwell in hospital with Covid so it remains vital that those most at risk come forward when they are invited to do so. “The response so far from the public to the largest and most successful vaccination programme in NHS history has been incredible, with more than nine in  people aged  and over getting their initial booster. The NHS Covid vaccination programme is once again ready to get people protected, so when you are invited please do come forward for your spring dose.” How can I get the second booster NHS health chiefs are expecting high uptake of spring boosters amongst people aged  and over after . million of them got their top up jab over autumn and winter, and have recruited additional call handlers for the  service to help people book their vaccine appointment. Calls to book an appointment can be made to , which are free from mobiles and landlines. Lines are open every day from am to pm, and  can provide support in  languages. Local NHS teams will be contacting care homes in their patch as they have done previously to arrange for spring boosters for people who are eligible and have been invited. Hundreds of sites including community pharmacies, vaccination centres and hospital hubs are offering spring boosters to those most vulnerable to coronavirus.Booking can also be made on the NHS website. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newsletters Is it important that I get the boosterI am eligible According to the government, it is still important for severely immunosuppressed people who have been advised to have a rd primary dose, for example those undergoing cancer treatment, to get this before getting a booster, for maximum protection from Covid-. While having three jab signicantly decreases your chances of falling badly ill or dying from coronavirus, the impact of the vaccine wears off over time. Having a booster jab helps to keep immunity levels as high as possible.  Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: “Spring boosters will help top up the immunity of the elderly and the most vulnerable to ensure they are protected and will help us continue to live with this virus.“Thanks to the NHS for rising to the challenge yet again to get people boosted. Please come forward as soon as you are contacted.” Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup added: “We are absolutely determined to protect those most vulnerable to Covid. “Please take up the offer of a spring booster as soon as you are contacted by the NHS – it will protect you and ensure we can continue to enjoy our freedoms.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBoris JohnsonCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A memo handed to the Sunday Times explained the action to colleagues. It said: “We understand that PO Ferries have an intention to try and re-employ many staff on new terms and conditions or use agency staff to restart routes”. It added: “Without these decisions an estimated , staff would likely lose their jobs. These changes will align them with other companies in the market who have undertaken a large reduction in staff.”News then broke on Thursday when the staff were abruptly sacked in a video call, without the  or -day notice unions say is required by law.  The Department for Transport today insisted it was simply an “internal government memo” explaining “what officials had been told by PO Ferries”, before ministers had the full facts. But TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This report shows his government sat on its hands and did nothing while hundreds of jobs and livelihoods were on the line. “There was no attempt to challenge PO on these unconscionable tactics – or even question whether these actions were legal. “Ministers, from the prime minister down, have serious questions to answer. This is a national scandal. It has to be a catalyst for change on workers’ rights.” Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh added: “This bombshell letter proves that the government was not only aware of PO ferries’ scandalous action - but complicit in it.“They knew people’s livelihoods were on the line and they knew PO was attempting to use exploitative fire and rehire practices. But they sat back and did nothing.”Ministers have since voiced outrage, and the government is looking into whether PO Ferries broke the law by failing to consult. Downing Street warned of ramications” which could include stripping the firm of any government contracts or revoking its low-tax freeport privileges.Chancellor Rishi Sunak lashed out at PO’s “appalling” decision - after personally championing Freeports like that on the Thames which is owned by PO’s Dubai owner DP World. He told the BBC : “What we are seeing is appalling, the way they have treated their workers is awful, it’s wrong.“Across government we are examining not just those actions and whether they comply with the regulations as they should have done, but also our own relationship with the company.”Itaposs understood Transport Secretary Grant Shappsapos private office received a copy of the memo on Thursday morning, just before the news became public. But Mr Shapps did not see the memo because he was taking Transport Questions in the House of Commons at the time, sources said.  Earlier No had insisted the news was kept to a tight circle of officials in the Department for Transport due to commercial confidentiality. The PM’s official spokesman said: “I don’t know exactly when the Prime Minister was informed”. A Whitehall source fumed: “Officials appear to have initially bought the PO Ferries line that this was essential to save the company from imminent collapse. “But talk of agency staff and getting operations up and running in just ten days should have set alarm bells ringing that this was no ordinary redundancy announcement with a proper consultation process. “Ministers were incandescent when they were made aware of what was taking place and intervened as quickly as possible.”  A DfT spokesperson said: This was an internal Government memo which, as standard practice, outlined what officials had been told by PO Ferries shortly before their announcement was made. This was sent before Ministers were advised of the full details and as soon as they were informed, they made clear their outrage at the way in which PO staff had been dismissed. “It is clear from the memo that our immediate priority was to work with unions to ensure workers’ rights continue to be protected and the Transport Secretary has urged the company to sit down with workers and reconsider this action.

TV’s Money Saving Expert issued a desperate direct plea to Chancellor Rishi Sunak ahead of Wednesday’s Spring Statement to offer more help to the poorest Brits.Mr Sunak today hinted he could cut fuel duty and did not rule out tweaking income tax or National Insurance thresholds to give people a little more of their money. He revealed he has set up a cost of living unit in the Treasury - amid suggestions he could raise the £ council tax rebate or £ repayable discount off energy bills.  He also claimed he would be lowering taxes by  - after raising the tax burden to its highest in  years. Mr Lewis said the % or £ rise in energy bills on April  will be “catastrophic” and Britain is already more than a quarter of the way through assessing another rise on October .That rise looks set to be “at least another £ a year”, which will add £, to bills across this year in total as million people are in fuel poverty, he told the BBC ’s Sunday Morning.He said: “I’ve been Money Saving Expert since . I’ve been through the financial crash, I’ve been through Covid which was mitigated by some of the measures the Chancellor put in place. “This is the worst - where we are right now, this is the worst.  “When I’m reading messages from people saying money prioritisation used to be ‘do I go to the hairdressers, or do I go to the pub and have a takeaway’. “Now it’s about prioritising ‘feeding my children over feeding myself’. That is simply not tenable in our society and there is absolute panic - and it has not started yet.” In a direct plea to Mr Sunak, he said: “As the Money Saving Expert who’s been known for this - I am virtually out of tools to help people now. “It’s not something money management can fix. “It’s not something for those in the lowest incomes, telling them to cut their bills will work. “We need political intervention.”Rishi Sunak is not expected to announce major changes to his policies in Wednesday’s Spring Statement despite National Insurance rising, tax and student loan thresholds being frozen, and energy bills soaring by £ a year. Moments before Mr Lewis’ intervention, he insisted people should feel confident about the strength of our economy.He told Sky Newsaposs Sophy Ridge On Sunday: The fundamentals of our economy are really good because weaposve recovered well, because of the actions weaposve taken, but look, the outlook is uncertain... because of whataposs happening in Ukraine.Conservative MP Robert Halfon said it was absolutely vital the Government cut fuel duty to ease the cost of living crisis. Asked about action on fuel duty, Mr Sunak said: Obviously I canapost comment on specic things.  “But what I would say, I understand that, I have a rural constituency, people are incredibly reliant on their cars and this is one of the biggest bills that people face, watching it go up, right, weaposre all seeing that, when weaposre filling up our cars. I get that, thataposs why weaposve frozen fuel duty already, I announced that in autumn, itaposs the th consecutive year of fuel duty freezes and that really helps people, I know that. Conservative MP Robert Halfon said it was absolutely vital the Government cut fuel duty to ease the cost of living crisis.On the cost of living, Mr Sunak said where we can make a dferent of course we will, but warned the actions and steps weaposre taking to sanction Russia are not cost-free for us here at home.He told Sky News programme Sophy Ridge On Sunday: I know this is the number one thing that people are concerned about, and people are working hard, theyaposre struggling with the price of things going up, I get that. Iaposm spending all my time focused on that.  I want people to know, and they should be reassured, that I will stand by them in the same way that I have done over the last couple of years to try and make a dference where I can, but as you said the actions and steps weaposre taking to sanction Russia are not cost-free for us here at home. I canapost pretend that itaposs going to easy, that Government can solve every challenge or that I can completely protect people against some of the dficult times ahead, But what I can say is where we can make a dferent of course we will, thataposs what weaposve done over the past two years, and most recently you saw that with our announcement to help people with energy bills - £ billion, £ of support to people, theyaposll get £ of that in April. So look, where we can make a dference of course we will, but I get that this is dficult. Ms Reeves said the rise in energy prices meant Labouraposs windfall tax concept would raise more money than first anticipated, adding: When I first said there should be a windfall tax back in January, we thought it would raise about £. billion but since then oil and gas prices have increased substantially and that surcharge, that windfall tax would now bring in about £. billion. Instead of carrying on down the path this Chancellor is going on, he should look again at Labouraposs proposals for a windfall tax and use that to keep bills low for everybody .

The fact this information was communicated by a curt, pre-recorded message over Zoom is all the more outrageous.Throughout the pandemic PO staff made sure vital supplies flowed into this country.They deserved to be applauded, not frog-marched off their boats at short notice.The bosses of parent company DP World should not expect to get away with it and they will deservedly join Sir Philip Green andCarillion in capitalism’s hall of shame.This is not just about corporate greed. It is also about our weak employment laws that let firms sack at will to hire cheaper staff. If Tory MPs are genuinely appalled by what has happened they will legislate to prevent such outrages being repeated.  Angels of hope Vladimir Putin has visited unimaginable horror on the people of Ukraine. Their bravery and resilience in the face of death and destruction has been humbling. So too has been the compassion they have shown to fellow citizens. Their remarkable spirit is demonstrated by the three women who risked their lives to ferry orphaned children from bombed cities to a sanctuary in the Carpathian Mountains. These angels of hope remind us goodness can flourish even amid the horrors of war. It is also why Putin will never suppress the people of Ukraine.

Ministers believe PO may have broken the law by failing to follow “clear rules” on firing staff.It has emerged that ministers knew on Wednesday what PO planned to do, but failed to act.Labour will try to force a vote banning “fire and rehire” on Monday night. Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “Labour will fight every step of the way.”PO Ferries is under threat of legal actionit fails to give satisfactory answers to  questions about the sacking of  seafarers by tomorrow’s pm deadline. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the information given by PO would “inform next steps”, but could lead to a “formal complaint to the relevant prosecuting authority”.PO Ferries has replaced the seafarers with cheaper agency staff, some on as little as £. an hour, it has been claimed. Its ferries are registered to Cyprus, the Bahamas and Holland, the RMT say. It could mean some foreign crews are not protected by UK employment law requiring a minimum wage of £. an hour.Karl Turner, Labour MP for Hull East, has claimed Filipino crew on PO’s Pride of Rotterdam service to Holland were paid just £. an hour. Mike Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union, said the “flags of convenience” practice had led to “widespread exploitation”. He said: “It’s one reason we used to have , seafarers in the country but now we’re lucky to have ,.  “It is a race to the bottom.” He called on ministers to take control of PO’s ferries. He said: “If they won’t honour the law then they should take control of those vessels and put our people back to work and be the operator of last resort.” Department for Transport civil servants were told on Wednesday about PO’s plan to replace staff, who were sacked on Thursday in a Zoom call.The Sunday Times revealed ministers were told the sackings would ensure PO “remain a key player in the UK market for years to come through restructuring”. The Department for Transport said the memo had “outlined what officials had been told by PO”. As soon as they were informed, ministers had “made clear their outrage”. In a letter to PO Ferries CEO Peter Hebblethwaite on Friday, Mr Kwarteng wrote: “Failure to meet the notication obligation is a criminal offence and can lead to an unlimited fine.” Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThe Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby described the sackings as a “sin”.As PO sailings were suspended for a third day, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: “The way they have treated their workers is awful, it’s wrong.We are examining not just those actions and whether they comply with the regulations, but our own relationship with the company.” PO did not respond to the Mirror’s questions. DP World, the Dubai-based owner of PO Ferries, has been urged to plug a £million hole in its pension scheme, money said to be owed to the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund.

And she claimed Vladimir Putin could exploit refugee flows to send agents to Britain.In her keynote speech, she said: Iaposve been asked why couldnapost we suspend security checks on people escaping Putinaposs war  Times of conflict, my friends, emphasises our need to remain watchful. I know from the briefings I receive from the intelligence and security services that instability around the world brings with it greater threats.  Only four years ago the Russian military intelligence services used a chemical weapon on British soil. She went on: The truth is that a very small number of people can wreak utter havoc. Russia has a history of covert hostile activity.And Iaposm afraid it is naive and misguided to think that only men can be covert operatives, or that refugee flows could not be subject to some form of exploitation.  Ms Patel went on: There are those who would come to our country, to this country, who mean us harm and who plot to strike at our very way of le. The processes that we have put in place closely follow the advice of our intelligence and security services. They mean we can help Ukrainians in need without making our country less safe. It comes as the Home Office said , visas had been granted under the family scheme for Ukrainians fleeing the war by pm on Friday. Ms Patel added: State threats and terrorism take many forms. They also thrive on indference and appeasement and now we are seeing them bolstered by new types of targeted biological, chemical, cyber warfare, ransomware and online threats. Our duty is to safeguard our countryaposs interests and we will never take our eye off the ball when it comes to the safety and security of our country. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said , places had been created in schools for children fleeing Ukraine and virtual lessons created during the coronavirus pandemic had been translated into Ukrainian. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove confirmed more than , households had now offered to house Ukrainian refugees, the majority of whom have made their way to Poland.

Mr Sunak did not rule out cutting fuel duty or raising the threshold at which people pay National Insurance, sparing some of the poorest workers. He revealed he has set up a cost of living unit in the Treasury - amid suggestions he could raise the £ council tax rebate or £ repayable discount off energy bills. He also claimed he would be lowering taxes by  - after raising the tax burden to its highest in  years.Yet the only policy the Chancellor has actually announced so far is a demand for the NHS to make £.bn of “efficiency” savings to cut “waste” in a move reminiscent of austerity.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour would not vote against a fuel duty cut - but warned Sky News: “Even a p reduction in fuel duty will only reduce filling up the car with petrol by £.So I donapost think that really rises to the scale of the challenge we face at the moment, which is why we are calling for a windfall tax on the big profits being made by North Sea oil and gas companies right now. Mr Sunak admitted he could not “fully protect” Brits, saying “I can’t pretend it’s going to be easy.”He told the BBC : “The steps we’ve taken to sanction Russia are not cost free for us here at home.“I want to be honest with people that it’s not going to be easy. “I wish government could solve absolutely every problem, that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. I can’t do that.  “What I would say is I will stand by them in the same way I have done over the past couple of years. Where we can make a dference, of course we will.” Askedhe is going to step in during the next months and years of rising energy costs he replied: “Of course I am, and people can judge me by my actions.” He tried to dampen fears the energy bills price cap will rise by another £ in October, saying: “We don’t know [yet] and I don’t want people to be scared.” But he dodged saying whether the number of people in fuel poverty will rise, replying: “I think the things we’re putting in place will make a dference.” Rishi Sunak is not expected to announce major changes to his policies in Wednesday’s Spring Statement despite the crisis.Martin Lewis today declared the cost-of-living surge coming in April is “the worst” crisis Brits have faced in  years including Covid and the financial crash.  TV’s Money Saving Expert issued a desperate direct plea to Chancellor Rishi Sunak ahead of Wednesday’s Spring Statement to offer more help to the poorest Brits. He told BBC Sunday Morning people are “genuinely choosing between whether they starve and whether they freeze” and the Chancellor should “suck in his ideology to fix it”. Conservative MP Robert Halfon said it was absolutely vital the Government cut fuel duty to ease the cost of living crisis. Asked about action on fuel duty, Mr Sunak said: Obviously I canapost comment on specic things. “But what I would say, I understand that, I have a rural constituency, people are incredibly reliant on their cars and this is one of the biggest bills that people face, watching it go up, right, weaposre all seeing that, when weaposre filling up our cars. I get that, thataposs why weaposve frozen fuel duty already, I announced that in autumn, itaposs the th consecutive year of fuel duty freezes and that really helps people, I know that. Ms Reeves said the rise in energy prices meant Labouraposs windfall tax concept would raise more money than first anticipated, adding: When I first said there should be a windfall tax back in January, we thought it would raise about £. billion but since then oil and gas prices have increased substantially and that surcharge, that windfall tax would now bring in about £. billion. Instead of carrying on down the path this Chancellor is going on, he should look again at Labouraposs proposals for a windfall tax and use that to keep bills low for everybody .

Tomorrowaposs emergency Parliamentary vote piloted by Labour will show us whose side Conservative MPs are really on.Multi-millionaire Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s cringing Lady Bountul act is the calculated deception of a record tax raiser posing as a cutter. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ counted  rises in two years but Sunak’s hoping the prospect of a few pennies off petrol – he’s grabbed a £-billion VAT windfall from soaring fuel prices – will switch eyes from £bn National Insurance hikes and £bn Income Tax increases.Condescendingly patting on the head with one hand, this slave driver whips viciously with the other.  And then there’s a Prime Minister who looked a -stone tub of duplicity waddling on Blackpool beach at the weekend. Unprincipled Boris Johnson demonstrated unfitness for high office and made enemies of friends by likening Ukrainian resistance to Putin’s invasion to Brexit. The free vote to leave a European family of nations that Ukraine’s heroic leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, is desperate to join isn’t remotely comparable to an unprovoked aggression by a Putin who incidentally cheered Brexit.  Brexit also cleaved Britain in half while Ukraine is united, yet this isn’t about common sense, facts or truth. Poisonous Johnson spouts bile to ide and rule, viewing Britain as a land of knuckle scrapers and reactionaries. Treating people with contempt gives Johnson much in common with PO’s marauders.

Energy bills, National Insurance and inflation are all surging in April, outstripping benefit, pension and wage rises. Meanwhile tax and student loan repayment thresholds are being frozen in a squeeze on the cost of living. The Ukraine-Russia war will make inflation worse in OBR forecasts out on Wednesday - the Mirror understands Whitehall officials are braced for it to go higher than %. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has is considering cutting fuel duty by p a litre after dropping a heavy hint on Sunday - but Labour warn this would barely touch the sides. Heaposs also said to have looked at raising the National Insurance threshold, to take some of the lowest-paid Brits out of the soon-to-be-hiked tax. But heaposs understood to be strongly resisting any bigger action like axing the NI hike or raising pensions or benefits beyond .%, as called for by Labour.  A source told the Sun on Sunday: The Spring Statement will be very policy-light. Donapost expect him to pull a rabbit out of a hat. Maybe a few baby bunnies, no more. The SNP called for an emergency package of support while Labour demanded a windfall tax on oil giants. And TVaposs Martin Lewis said: “As the Money Saving Expert who’s been known for this - I am virtually out of tools to help people now. “It’s not something money management can fix. It’s not something for those in the lowest incomes, telling them to cut their bills will work. We need political intervention.” The Tory Chancellor said “where we can make a dference, of course we will” and has set up a cost of living unit in the Treasury - amid suggestions he could raise the £ council tax rebate or £ repayable discount off energy bills.  He also claimed he would be lowering taxes by  - after raising the tax burden to its highest in  years. Yet the only policy he had actually announced by Sunday is a demand for the NHS to make £.bn of “efficiency” savings to cut “waste” in a move reminiscent of austerity. Mr Sunak also warned Brits “it’s not going to be easy”, saying: “I wish government could solve absolutely every problem, that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. I can’t do that. So when and what is the Spring Statement, and what do we know about how it’s shaping up  Here’s what you need to know.When is the Spring Statement  Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the  Spring Statement on Wednesday  March at .pm. He will give a speech in the Commons, followed by documents and forecasts published online. After complaints from the Speaker, less of his statement is expected to be ‘trailed’ in advance. What is the Spring Statement The Spring Statement is a ‘mini-Budget’ by the Chancellor on the situation facing the economy.It is lower-key than a Budget and does not contain the same tax and spending powers.For instance, fuel duty and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol were already set for the year in October’s Budget. So was the minimum wage rise from £. to £. in April - though you can expect Mr Sunak to crow about it anyway.What will Chancellor Rishi Sunak announce during the Spring Statement The Chancellor is expected to lay out the sheer scale of the cost-of-living disaster hitting poor Brits. This will be in the form of Office for Budget Responsibilityforecasts on GDP growth, borrowing, debt and inflation. They will also have the warm-up acts of the Bank of England’s interest rates decision tomorrow, and monthly inflation figures for February - which will be published at am on the day of the Spring Statement. While growth is rising post-Covid, so is inflation - and it is set to be much worse than the last forecast . All this will ramp up pressure to announce extra help for households - but he’s reluctant to do that. He reportedly has £bn more in coffers than hoped as rising prices lead to higher taxes. But soaring inflation looks set to push up his borrowing bill, as debt costs more to pay back. He could recycle already-announced policies or announce vague ‘consultations’ on future ones, but will it be enough  UK inflation could rise over % Shock analysis last week found inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Ukraine invasion made it even worse.The Mirror understands Whitehall officials believe this figure, calculated by the Resolution Foundation, is broadly accurate. Officials in fact fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of  and even hitting %. This will blow October’s forecasts - that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .% - out of the water. It will mean more expensive food and goods in the shops, hitting the poorest families hardest. Will fuel duty be cut on petrol  Fuel duty was already frozen at October’s Budget for a th year in a row - handing £, to the average car driver since . But Tory MP Robert Halfon said it is vital the Government go further and cut it after prices soared due to the Ukraine war. And on Sunday the Chancellor dropped a heavy hint that it could be cut - with speculation suggesting itaposll be p a litre. Mr Sunak said: Obviously I canapost comment on specic things. But what I would say, I understand that, I have a rural constituency, people are incredibly reliant on their cars and this is one of the biggest bills that people face, watching it go up, right, weaposre all seeing that, when weaposre filling up our cars. I get that. The Resolution Foundation declared fuel duty cuts will inevitably be part of the package announced this week. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour would not vote against a fuel duty cut - but warned Sky News: “Even a p reduction in fuel duty will only reduce filling up the car with petrol by £. So I donapost think that really rises to the scale of the challenge.  Will National Insurance thresholds change National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April . Tory MPs are still pushing for this to be cancelled as it’s a major tax rise just as a cost-of-living crisis hits. Downing Street insisted the rise is going ahead, despite previous claims Boris Johnson was wobbling.But could it be tweaked instead  Itaposll be paid by anyone earning over £, a year - up from the £, a year now. Thereaposs some speculation the Chancellor could raise this threshold, which is currently lower than the point at which people pay Income Tax. That would take some of the lowest earners out of paying the tax altogether. The failure to raise the threshold by inflation is a stealth tax thataposs costing Brits an extra £ a year, says research. One Tory told the Mirror: “If itaposs about pride, they can now say that Ukraine is the reason they need to change course. NHS forced to cut £.bn of aposwasteapos The Chancellor announced a demand for the NHS to make £.bn of “efficiency” savings over three years to cut “waste” in a move reminiscent of austerity. That means DOUBLING the annual NHS efficiency target to .%. The current level of waste across government is simply not acceptable,” Mr Sunak said. But Pat Cullen, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “Trying to squeeze even more out of the same staff will not work. The existing shortages already mean nursing staff work unpaid overtime to keep the NHS running.” Another £ million is predicted to come from a review of Quangos or armaposs s bodies - publicly funded but not entirely Government-controlled. Could Rishi Sunak change energy grant  Previously Rishi Sunak announced a £ council tax discount for Bands A-D next month, and a £ repayable rebate in October. Yet bills are rising by £ a year on April  and will rise again in October - possibly by another £, a year. This is a far bigger hit to the poorest tenth of households who spend around % of their income on energy. The richest spend %. Thereaposs speculation Mr Sunak could increase the £ or £ packages to make them more generous.Treasury officials want to wait until the run-up to the October rise before announcing more help. But a former Treasury minister told the Mirror that approach is “not going to work”, adding: “He’s going to have to do something, it just can’t be the full Covid.” Will there be help for childcare  The Chancellor is considering more help for parents who pay for childcare after Boris Johnson raised the issue in Cabinet, according to the Sunday Times. Ministers are said to be looking at plans to increase the number of children that registered childminders can look after, which now stands at six up to the age of eight. Dad-of-six Jacob Rees-Mogg - who has a nanny - is said to have backed the idea saying: Even I can look after six children at once.Row over energy supply plan and nuclear power Boris Johnson is supposed to set out a delayed, long-term energy supply plan this week - for the UK to wean off Russian oilby the end of the year. This is expected to invest more in renewable power and nuclear power, as well as trying to get more oil from places like Saudi. But Rishi Sunak reportedly insisted it should be delayed to give him more time to assess the costs of nuclear and green power. The PM is privately frustrated with his Chancelloraposs refusal to endorse a massive surge in nuclear power, according to the Sunday .  Will other tax hikes change  The Income Tax personal allowance and p rate threshold will freeze at £, and £,. The IFS think tank warns the threshold freezes will lead to more than £bn in ‘stealth’ taxes as inflation soars - and by , % of GDP will have been added to the UK tax burden. Meanwhile the VAT rate for hospitality firms, currently .% due to Covid, is due toto %. There are spaces here for the Chancellor to act - but it would scupper his claims to be recovering from Covid.Will benefits and pensions rise in April Mr Sunak will raise benefits by just .% - as little as £. a month on Universal Credit and far less than inflation. In October he cut Universal Credit for millions by £ a week. Pensions will also rise by just .% after the triple lock was axed.In a Budget rabbit out of the hat in October, he handed more generous benefits to .million working families by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate from p to p. But this only helps those who work, not the sick or out-of-work.The Resolution Foundation is worried there will be a “rollercoaster” with real benefits down this year and up next year. Tory MP Nigel Mills suggested bringing forward next yearaposs increase in Universal Credit to this autumn to solve the problem. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves called for benefits to rise by the rate of inflation - which is .% now and could rise beyond %. That could be double the .% rise in April, worth just £. a month on the standard allowance of Universal Credit. She told the Observer: “The chancellor should look at how to uprate benefits in a fair way. They are supposed to go up by inflation and they are not at the moment. But Mr Sunak seems unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost - and the need to raise pensions and pay at the same timehe does.  Will defence spending rise  Westminster sources told the Sunday Mirror the Chancellor is planning to raise the £billion MoD budget. One said: “Ministers are no longer talking about defence cuts. They now see the need to beef up our forces to confront Russia.” And that could reverse the planned reduction of , troops to , by . But the Chancellor tried to hose down the reports, saying he has already presided over the biggest rise in defence spending since the Cold War.Will there be a pay rise for nurses, teachers and other public sector workers from April  Inflation means planned rises to public sector wages - due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But the Treasury is resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  .Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike.Pressure on the Chancellor to reverse this will be huge but again, it will take a lot for him to budge.  Will alcohol prices rise and when  The cost of beer and sparking wine will fall, but whisky and vodka prices will rise, according to changes already announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his October Budget. Currently there is a complicated system of  separate tax bands for booze, across four main areas: beer, cider, spirits and wine. But the chancellor will do away with the old system and bring in a new one from February next year. This means tax cuts on drinks like normal-strength beer, wine, cider and liqueurs, but tax hikes on spirits like whisky. Sparkling wine costs will fall by around p a bottle.A vision beyond Covid and the war The Chancellor will likely try to set out a world beyond Covid but the Ukraine war and soaring inflation will make this dficult. Expect many references to infrastructure and ‘levelling-up’ but be on the lookout for old pots of money being reannounced. One Tory admitted to the Mirror: “The Rachel Reeves line that weaposre a high tax, low growth Government is true at the moment. “We donapost seem to have many pro-growth policies, weaposve pretty much given up on supply-side reforms.

The -year-old is demanding Boris Johnson “rebuilds general practice” and is joining forces with his former sworn enemies at the British Medical Association.The move follows repeated broken Tory promises to increase the GP workforce.

Mr Hunt said: “The BMA and I haven’t always sat on the same side of table, but I’m joining them and other GPs today to sound the alarm about the workforce crisis in our surgeries because we must now rebuild general practice as a matter of urgency. “We can forget fixing the backlog unless we urgently come up with a plan to train enough doctors for the future and crucially, retain the ones we’ve got.“As someone who tried hard to get more GPs into local surgeries but ultimately didn’t succeed because the numbers retiring early exceeded those joining, I’m passionate about fixing this.” Doctors are seeing on average  patients a day, while previously  was deemed safe. Mr Hunt will today be joined by GPs and BMA leaders for a campaign launch in Marylebone, Central London, setting out three key demands to “rebuild general practice”.  They want the Government to fulfil its pledge to recruit , more family doctors in England by . They are also calling for a plan to reduce GP workloads to safe levels and for factors driving experienced doctors out of the profession to be properly addressed.

But not in any Sam Smith pubs. Itaposs no secret that mobile phones in particular have had a huge impact in the way we interact with people face to face, and thereaposs arguably nothing more annoying than sitting opposite someone whoaposs more interested than Instagram than holding a conversation.So, back in , pub chain Samuel Smithaposs Brewery, which operates around  pubs in the north of England, announced it would be introducing a series of strict in-house rules, in a bid to boost social conversation person to person.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The rules include no phones, no juke boxes and absolutely no laptops. If you have to take a call, you should go outside to answer, just like a smoker would to have a cigarette, according to boss Humphrey Smith. The ban also applies to tablets and iPads, which cannot be used inside or outside. Not only that, pubs owned by the chain are not allowed to play music or televisions, while there is also a zero tolerance on swearing. The policies were introduced in order to ensure the brewery maintained a traditional, uncompromisingly Victorian aesthetic, while maintaining the notion that pubs are for social conversation person to person. In a world where most people see their mobile phone as an extension of their arm itaposs pretty controversial, but thereaposs no getting away from the fact it would boost actual real-le conversations. Itaposs certainly not for everyone, butyou fancy a nostalgic trip down memory line to a simpler pre-technological time, Sam Smith pubs are the place to go.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Image: Liverpool Echo Phoebe BartonByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience WriterPhoebe Barton:,  Mar |commentsGordon Ramsay has been criticised by customers for the steep prices of his food on a number of occasions.If itaposs not his fry up thataposs being called a rip off, itaposs the cost of his steak and chips that is offending customers.So when Gordon Ramsay’s new Bread Street Kitchen  Bar restaurant opened, Liverpool Echo journalist Phoebe Barton was keen to put her tastebuds - and Gordon - to the test.The restaurant, located in Liverpool, offers a large iety of starters, main courses, desserts and drinks, many of which caught Phoebeaposs eye. Despite being tempted by the steak, beef wellington, spinach and ricotta cannelloni and the butter chicken curry, she finally settled on fish and chips. The dish consisted of battered fish, chunky chips, mushy peas, tartare sauce and chip shop curry sauce, and cost £. - which according to Phoebe is pricer than some of the other restaurants in the city. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.There’s no denying Bread Street Kitchen  Bar is a pricier dining venue compared to some other restaurants in the city, she said.Iaposm sometimes wary that you can be paying for the name that’s above the door rather than the quality of the food, but this wasn’t the case at Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant. She continued: When my fish and chips arrived, I was delighted by how delicious the dish looked. The fish was a good size and the golden-brown batter looked perfect. The three little dishes containing the mushy peas, tartare sauce and curry sauce were a feast for the eyes - I couldn’t wait to e in.My kne cracked through the batter revealing the bright white fish, which flaked into chunks as the kne smoothly sliced through it. And it tasted just as good as it looked. The taste was ine and the texture super soft, highlighting how fresh the fish was, she said. The mushy peas were soft but not runny like they sometimes can be, and they seemed to have a slight hint of mint which I thoroughly enjoyed. The condiments also got a thumbs up from Phoebe. The chip shop curry sauce at Bread Street Kitchen  Bar was absolutely delicious. It had a lovely kick but wasn’t too spicy, and the sauce had a creamy texture which coated the chips well. I’d have to say it was the best curry sauce I’ve ever had.The tartare sauce was creamy, smooth, full of flavour and it complimented the fish beautully. Phoebeaposs only criticism of the dish was the colour of the chips. While she admits they were very tasty, she said she usually prefers chunky chips to be a little crispier. I usually wouldn’t pay £. for fish and chips, however, I have to say it was worth every penny. Every component was cooked beautully and full of flavour. Having eaten fish and chips so many times over the years, it’s rare for me to feel like I’m eating the dish for the very first time, but this is how I felt dining on Bread Street Kitchen  Bar’s fish and chips. But the impressiveness didnapost stop there.  Despite being very full, I couldn’t resist looking at the dessert menu, she said, and after a lovely waiter talked her through each item, she finally settled on the Monkey Shoulder Cranachan Cheesecake With Raspberry Sorbetbased on their recommendation. Although she admitted she had no idea what to expect from the pudding, Gordon Ramsay certainly didnapost disappoint. It was super light and fluffy, and the flavour was incredible. The raspberry sorbet was smooth and refreshing, a perfect match to the flavours in the cheesecake. The raspberries were soft and full of flavour, and the crumb and chocolate sauce completed the dish. Overall Phoebe thoroughly enjoyed her meal at the Liverpool Bread Street Kitchen  Bar restaurant, and unlike many of Gordonaposs customers, agreed that his prices were just right due to the delicious food, friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

And one activity during the visit to the farm left Kate remarking how their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would be very jealous of them.It came as the couple were shown some chocolate fountains, which made their eyes light up. The pair indulged by dipping tortilla chips into the brown sticky liquid and they also tried hot chocolate made from the organic farm.  And Kate confessed: “I think our children will be very jealous.” She also remarked on the smell emanating from around the farm and said: The smell of the chocolate is amazing.” William even joked about giving up his day job as a working royal asking Julio Saqui owner of the family-run chocolate firm “Do you take apprentices  Can I come and work for you it’s my kind of thing.” Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Kate, , in a blue floral Tory Burch dress and Sezane earrings, was first onto the dancefloor, cutting shapes with nine local schoolchildren from the Garuna Cultural Centre.

They were soon holding hands and gyrating to the music as locals screamed in delight. She said afterwards: “He shook his waist to the music. He had beautul rhythm.

Connor Dockerty was stabbed four times by a then -year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons. The dad-of-twoaposs killer, now aged , was handed a le sentence with a minimum of  years behind bars at Liverpool Crown Court. The unarmed victim, aged just , staggered into a garden in Huyton after the attack and with his last words said: Iaposm dying - tell my kids I love them.Before his murderer was sent down, a police officer read out heartbreaking statements on behalf of Mr Dockertyaposs grieving family, the Liverpool Echo reports.They included a poignant tribute from the victimaposs ex-girlfriend, Leigh McCallum, the mother of his six-year-old daughter who spoke of their utter heartbreak. She said her daughter could not understand what happened, full of questions for which aposthere were no answersapos.  Ms McCallum said: Connor doted on her from the day she was born and they developed an amazing bond. She was a daddyaposs girl in every way and long after our relationship had ended, Connor still had her every weekend and regularly visited through the week. He called her every night before she went to bed to tell her that he loved her. The mum added: She was five-years-old at the time of her father’s murder, and having to explain to her that her dad had gone was the hardest thing Iaposve ever had to do. She simply could not understand why this had happened and why she would never get to spend time with him again. The following days and weeks were hard for her, she had so many questions and I had none of the answers. After Connoraposs funeral I began to see just how much losing Connor had affected her. She became withdrawn, quiet and anxious and spent most of her time close to me. She had to start sleeping with me as she would often wake upset through the night. She told me that she was worried about her family and didn’t want anybody  to leave her.  She keeps pictures of her dad on a shelf in her room and still draws him pictures and makes him cards in school and at home. Sheaposs saved every one of them in the hope that one day she will be able to give them to him. She has never suffered loss before and she’s too young to understand le and death and what that means. Ms McCallum said she felt heartbroken for her daughter having to live the rest of her le without Mr Dockerty. She added: I cannot imagine how that will be for her discovering the reason why her dad is no longer with her and missing all the important days that she should get to share with him, because he wonapost be there. Losing Connor has been so dficult. Having to come to terms with the fact that heaposs not here anymore and that I have to raise his daughter without him has been unbearable. Le will not be the same for any of us. Mr Dockertyaposs dad, Robert Burrow, recalled how he helped him overcome the devastating loss of his we. He said: Growing up Connor was forever my shadow, my wingman and co-conspirator in many jokes and dares, the type that only two like-minded idiots could come up with. When my we, Connoraposs mother, passed away, I almost gave up on the world and it was only Connoraposs constant care and attention that helped me through. But now he is gone too. There is no word in the English language to describe a person who has lost a child. If you lose your parents you are an orphan. If you lose your partner you are a widower. What do you become following the loss of a child  Connoraposs loss has left a hole in my le that nothing can ever fill. I miss my little friend. The court also heard statements from Mr Dockertyaposs aunt, Jackie Grfin, and cousin, Rebecca Blease.  Ms Grfin recalled how he comforted her with a hug when his mum - her sister - died, and how even though his world had been shattered, he was concerned about her feelings. Tragically, that was the last embrace they shared. Ms Grfin said: Connor was not perfect. But he did not deserve to die like this at such a young age. I don’t know how I got through the weeks that followed. Even now I struggle to get through the days. Connor is constantly on my mind and I cannot accept the way in which he was taken. He should still be here. She added: I am left with a huge hole in my heart knowing that I will never get to see him again, or get a hug off him and hear him ask aposare you ok Auntie Jackie apos The first and last thing I think about every day is Connor. I don’t think that I will ever get over this. He is never coming back to us and I am destroyed. I am consoled by the fact that Connor is at last back with his beloved mum, but even this doesn’t stop my pain and suffering. Connor leaves behind his beautul kids who will now grow up without their dad.  As Connoraposs family we will make sure that they never forget him just like we wonapost. Connor loved his children, they meant everything to him and we will make sure that they know that they were in his final thoughts. Three months after his death, it would have been Mr Dockertyaposs th birthday. Ms Grfin said: We met up as Connors family and friends and released some balloons in his memory. We have named a star after him so that we can all look to the sky at night and feel that he is looking down on us. As his children get older I hope that it will bring them some comfort to think that although their daddy may not be here he is a star in the sky shining down on them. Ms Blease described him as her first best friend, who lit up sleepovers at her nanaposs house, and always made people laugh. She said thoughts of what happened to him haunted her in the wake of his death and she couldnapost shake them off. However, she said: Iaposm glad that his last thought was of his kids because he loved them so much. Members of Mr Dockertyaposs family cried in the public gallery, as the statement from Ms Blease continued. She said: You donapost expect what happened to Connor to happen to you or your loved ones. Thereaposs not a day that goes by that I don’t think about him, every morning and every night. He even has a corner in my bedroom with his fingerprint, photos, T-shirts from his funeral and balloon release and his star that I bought and named after him. Thataposs what we loved to do when we were kids, just gazing at the night sky in our nanaposs conservatory. I just wish we could go back to that moment.

Just one six-bedroom home is still standing but will be gone soon after a planning rules breach. The properties were up to a third bigger than the submitted plans and were built in dferent locations than was allowed. Bolton Council ordered their removal in .An appeal by the builder and owners has failed. Cllr Andy Morgan said: “Four of the five houses have now come down. It’s the right thing to do.” He said two applications had been submitted for slightly dferent homes on the West Pennine Moors site near Bolton.  The luxury detached properties, at Grundy Fold Farm, off Chorley Old Road, for which Bolton council issued an enforcement notice for demolition in , were up to a third bigger and in dferent locations than allowed, a planning inquiry heard. Planning permission was initially granted for the conversion of the former farmhouse and four new homes around a central courtyard in . At the inquiry, our sister paper the MEN reported that Bolton Council argued harm had been caused to the green belt and that the current location of the houses represents ‘a signicant departure away from the clear design intentions of the  scheme’.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Bolton Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The old adage of you canapost teach an old dog new tricks is untrue in Brambleaposs case, with the cute pooch having learned how to play the classic puzzle game at the grand age of . She lives with dog trainer and behaviourist Jodie Forbes, , who has taught her beloved pets dozens of tricks - including how to pick up tokens with their paws and slot them in the grid, Dorset Live reports.Bramble has a sister who also plays - -month-old Kelpie and Border Collie Cross, Willow.  Jodie, , from Bournemouth, explained: “When I was a kid, I read that Border Terriers were ‘untrainable’, ‘not to be trusted off-lead’ and ‘highly stubborn’ and I vowed to prove that wrong. “Bramble has learned hundreds of tricks and her and Willow’s latest is to play Connect Four. I started by using socks and a plastic tub and I’d get them use their nose-eye co-ordination to drop the sock in a tub.“Then I used smaller and smaller objects until we they were able to pick the Connect Four tokens up in their mouths and drop them in the top of the grid. “If a token falls on the floor or table, they know to pick it up and drop it in again. They’re such clever dogs.” Jodie has been training dogs since she was nine including for media campaigns and has appeared at Crufts many times, showing her dogs and taking part in agility and displays. She is a brand ambassador for pet food company Natures Menu and Bramble and Willow showed off their skills at the world’s biggest dog show at the NEC in Birmingham last weekend.  And for pet parents looking to teach their dogs tricks, Jodie suggests a simple ‘spin.’ “You get a smelly treat - I like the Natures Menu puppy training ones. “Hold it between your finger and thumb above their nose and spin  degrees, and they follow it, do a spin then you give them the treat. Keep practicing and rewarding so when you say ‘spin’ they do it!” Jodie says dog owners want to spend more time than ever with their furry friends thanks to the bond they built during lockdown.  The canine population shot up from . million in  to . million in  and now one in three households in the UK has a dog. Jodie said: “People want to try new activities and sports with their dogs because they were sat at home for so long and our dogs were such good company. We’ve connected more and after all that we’ve been through for the past few years we’ve realised it’s fun to go out with your dog, enjoy le and feel good.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsDogsAll About DogsTeamDogsMy Pets\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Daniela Elser pointed out the Queen has never given a single interview and said one lesson the Monarch can teach us is the power of silence. Andever there has been a time in royal history when the -year-old has put that philosophy into blistering effect it has been over the last -days and change, Ms Elser wrote, in a piece for news.au.The royal commentator compared this approach to Meghan and Harry giving their famous tell-all interview to Oprah last year, in which they dropped several bombshells, from the duchessapos thoughts of suicide to damaging claims of racism. Following this, Ms Elser wrote, the world waited for how the Queen would react. She highlighted how the Queen released a short statement days after the interview, but has stayed silent since then. It took nearly two days for courtiers to put out a -word statement of truly breathtaking economy and which infamously read in part, apossome recollections may yapos, Ms Elser wrote.  She added that the remarkable thing is that still, one year on, there hasnapost been any word uttered on the matter. But she pointed out that Harry and Meghan have since then appeared in ious interviews - including Harryaposs podcast with Dax Shepherd, and had only just started speaking their truth after their TV interview in March . At the time, Ms Elser went on, it seemed like the palace was being woefully shortsighted, clinging to their time-honoured modus operandi of impervious silence, rigidly refusing to engage or considering doing things dferently in the face of even this unprecedented mess.However, with the benefit of hindsight, that has proven to be a shrewd approach to a febrile situation. Ms Elser added she was not suggesting Meghan and Harry did not have legitimate grievances that need to be addressed. But she said the repeated, self-righteous repeated airing of family dirty laundry has in fact only really dealt them a PR blow. Both Harry and Meghan told Oprah how much they respected Her Majesty but they both seem to have missed the crucial lesson she could have taught them about not only the power but the dignity of silence, Ms Elser added. Now there are fears Harry could “disrespect” Kate Middleton in his tell-all memoir of his le, which is due to be published later this year.There has been much speculation about what he will include in the book and how members of the Royal Family will be portrayed in it, withprevious commentarysuggesting the book has sparked a “tsunami of fear” in royal circles.The -year-old prince is expected to cover his letime in the public eye, including his time in the military, marriage and fatherhood in the book, which is to be published by Penguin Random House.

One of them was Mondayaposs Commonwealth Day service, also at the Abbey, with the decision to cancel her appearance understood to be related to her comfort travelling the -mile journey from Windsor Castle to London and sitting through the event, rather than a specic illness. The -year-old monarch has faced increasing issues with her mobility in recent months, leaving her “on certain days” struggling to get about, according to palace sources. Have your say on the plan in the comment section  And now the Sun reports Buckingham Palace officials are thought to be looking at a wide range of operations for getting her to the Abbey - and prevent photographers getting a picture.Sources told how senior palace aides are looking at having the Queen flown from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace by helicopter. The trip would take just  minute by chopper, and staff would then drive the monarch the short distance from the Palace to the Abbey, sealing off the entirety of Deanaposs Yard to prevent anyone getting near before parking the car by a side door.  Despite having just last week been on her feet for face-to-face engagements at Windsor, it is reported her closest aides are concerned at the prospect of Her Majesty walking the  yards from the Abbey entrance to her seat. Sources told the Sun that options including six-foot privacy screens or a football-style tunnel are being looked at, to block photographers from trying to capture a shot of the Queen exiting the car. The Queen is thought to be determined to continue walking and is understood to have dismissed the idea of using a wheelchair.But it is reported the option has been considered by her aides so she can move around the Abbey in comfort - with the aging royal being brought to Poetsapos Corner before a short walk to her seat in the Sanctuary. Ingrid Seward, who is editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, told the paper: “Understandably, the Queen doesn’t want to be seen in a wheelchair. “But as the Head of State and someone who wants to be seen and needs to be seen, she might concede to a wheelchair. The best way of doing that is to make sure there are no photographs taken.  She added: “She would really hate to miss it. It is a headache for her staff as it would be dficult for anyone of her age who suffers mobility problems. It would be a painful process for her.” Another option being considered is having the Queen ready at her seat before the rest of the audience arrives for the memorial ceremony, eschewing for the sake of her comfort the tradition of having the monarch arrive last.A source told the Sun that t he Queen has told her staff she does not want to use a wheelchair.Get all the royal news you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersHowever, she has agreed to be given assistance in order to enter through the Abbeyaposs side entrance quick enough. There, they said, she will be able to exit the car in prive and using her walking stick, whilethere are efforts being made to keep photographers away.They add that,she needs the wheelchair, then that must be done behind screens or once she is in the side entrance. Meanwhile TV broadcasters will be requested to be considerate in their coverage. The source added that aides believe this is to be the only way the Queen can get into the Abbey and are determined the process be out of the public eye.

The day after Tanya Simpson took her own le her family were informed that she couldaposve been reunited with her estranged kids. The -year-old, whose body was found on March  at her Northfield, Birmingham home, had left notes for her nine-year-old daughter and son, aged four, her family said, Birmingham Mail reported. One read: “I love you, I cannot cope without you.” The family had been split up after sheaposd gone to school with a shallow scratch on her face. Do you have a story to share  Email webnews@mirror  Police were called and Tanya admitted that she’d accidentally caused the minor injury while cradling the child’s face. Birmingham Childrenaposs Trust decided to take the girl and her brother because of the injury and concerns they had over Tanyaaposs mental health, a document in the familyaposs possession shows. Her daughter was placed with grandparents Ed and Linda, and her son with his father. Tanya had access to them twice a week. Prior to that, there had been no social services involvement over the youngsters’ care, her family insist. Tanyaaposs loved ones want to know why the children were taken away so swtly. Fighting back tears, sister Kimberly said: “I can’t help but hate them. They don’t realise what they’ve done to my family, what they’ve done to the kids. You can see the pain in the little boy’s face. They tore those children apart. How can you split up two kids who have been together for so long  “Mum and dad have lost their baby daughter. To add to their pain, they received a call the day after to be told it had been decided Tanya could have her daughter back.A social worker dealing with the case told my mum a meeting had been set to change the plan so she could move back with her mum. We can’t understand why the children had separate social workers.” She added: “If my sister was not an unemployed single mum,she had the money to pay for a lawyer, this would not have happened. If we’d had the money to pay for a solicitor, this would not have happened. Kimberly claimed her sister told social workers and police, who decided to take no action over the scratch, that she would kill herself.  Paperwork relating to the case shows that Tanya made efforts to get the children back. She underwent hair-strand and other tests to show she was drug and alcohol free, and attended an anger management course. “She was a great mother,” said -year-old Kimberley. “She lived for her kids, she would never hurt her kids. My sister never had a drink problem. She had a problem with emotions and would turn to drink, but that was when she was  and . “And that was the problem. What they added to Tanya’s plan happened when she was a teenager. What happened was an accident. She was getting her daughter ready for school and she was not listening to her mum. Tanya put her hands on her face and accidentally scratched her. She had very long nails. “The police said they may charge her, but dropped the case. We’re angry about the time they took to make that decision. What social workers were saying did not make sense. I can see the heartbreak in my sister’s face. Twice a week she got to see her children at her mother’s home. She couldn’t take the pain. The only time my sister was happy was when she was seeing her kids. Kimberley said she was the last person to speak to her sister. She told me she couldn’t cope without her kids, she recalled. I said, ‘there’s always hope’ and she told me, ‘you don’t understand - I can’t live without my kids’. She couldn’t cope without her kids.” Kimberley believes the case was delayed because it was passed from one social worker to another. An inquest is to take place over the death, but the family have said that Tanya took her own le. Kimberley revealed that her sister rang emergency services and told them what she’d done. An ambulance arrived at pm, but it was some time before police could gain access to the property. Tanya’s father, -year-old Ed, said: “It is asit’s not real. She did speak about it , she tried to do it, but no one would listen. We went to the doctors and it was like talking to a wall. She was a good mother, it was an accident, but it was like talking to a wall. We were pushed from pillar to post. No one we turned to would listen. A spokesman for Birmingham Children’s Trust, responsible for child care in the city, said: “Whilst we cannot comment on inidual cases, we do extend our condolences to the family following this tragic event.” Tanya’s funeral will take place at Lodge Hill Cemetery and Crematorium on March .*The Samaritans are available  you need to talk.

She had started having headaches, fever and stomach pain in September last year, Birmingham Live reports. On her visit to the hospital, doctors found the Newtown, Birmingham girl was in fact suffering from a rare brain condition. Doctors checked her after a two hour wait, but she would die several days later after developing fluid in her brain from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. An investigation found there were gaps in her care, including a delay in admitting her to the intensive care unit and delays in seizure control.  Paying tribute to his daughter after her inquest, Mohamoud Hussein said: Over the last few months, the passing of Maryama has been extremely painful for us to deal with as a family. Her unexpected death has left a massive hole in our lives. Maryama was only with us for a short time but she made us the happiest people in the world. She was just wonderful and creative and she was beautul inside and outside. She was the sweetest, most caring child you could ever meet. She will forever be missed dearly by everyone that loves her. Maryamaaposs family said they want to ensure mistakes are not repeated with anyone  receiving care at the hospital, and that they want lessons to be learned. He added: We were perplexed, they did admit there were failures but there was no causal link between the mistakes that were made and her passing away. Obviously, it wonapost bring Maryama back, but we understand. We still live in Birmingham and we want the hospital to make sure this doesnapost happen to anyone . The mistakes that were made should be lessons for the hospital and the trust.Maryamaaposs family said she was a happy, fit and sociable girl before she developed apostummy bugapos symptoms, including vomiting and headaches. When they tried to book her a GP appointment on September  they were told she could not be admitted to the surgery because her high temperature might mean she had Covid.Following the appointment Maryama was admitted to the Emergency Department of Birmingham Children’s Hospital. There she displayed the same symptoms as well as bouts of unconsciousness and seizures. In her initial triage, she was aposincorrectlyapos assessed as being well enough to wait, the inquest was told. She was eventually treated for acute disseminated encephalomyelitisand given antibiotics to cover the possibility of bacterial infection of the central nervous system. However, her condition had deteriorated the next day and the young girl started suffering further seizures and bouts of unconsciousness. After the symptoms abated for a short while, they came back on October  and Maryama was transferred to an intensive care unit. Her parents had a meeting with the hospital to discuss their concerns and were told that an internal investigation would be performed because of the delay in admitting Maryama to ICU. Shortly after an unsuccessful attempt to perform a brain stem test, the young girl was pronounced brain dead, and her devastated parents gave their consent for le support to be terminated on October . The internal investigation into Maryama’s treatment highlighted failures in the triage system, the ICU admission system and delays in seizure control. Following the inquest family solicitors Shoosmiths said: “We welcome the above acknowledgement of failings in care but will be closely considering Maryama’s cause of death with our own experts and commissioning an independent report. “We will be continuing with our investigations given the severity of the errors and the changes to practices and procedures that are being considered by the trust at the moment. We hope that these changes will prevent a similar outcome for another family.” Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital has vowed to act following the gaps in Maryamaaposs care. Dr Fiona Reynolds, the Chief Medical Officer, said: “We would like to share our sincere sympathies with the family at the sad death of Maryama and reassure them that we will act on what they have told us we could have been done dferently in her care.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsInquestsTributes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Professor Roger Kirby, president of the Royal Society of Medicine, has suggested the government may be forced to take some preventative actionthe numbers continue rising. He said that the country was not out of the pandemic yet, and that the government should not risk being complacent.  When it came to the question of a third full lockdown, Professor Kirby believes the population at large would not accept it. Locking down people again, I don’t think people would tolerate it again, he told Mail Online. There would be riots like there were in Belgiumthey tried to do that. In November last year large demonstrations against coronavirus restrictions in Brussels turned violent. Stones were thrown by demonstrators calling for the lting of measures put in place against the Omicron iant, despite Belgium being among the worst hit by coronavirus in Europe.  In the UK anti-lockdown protests never reached such a high octane. The closest things got to bubbling over was in December  when thousands of protesters have marched through London to voice their anger over the then latest Covid restrictions. Crowds assembled in Parliament Square as part of a Freedom Rally against vaccine passports and other virus rules. Demonstrators shouted shame on you as they clashed with police.Some officers suffered minor injuries while escorting a police motorcyclist through the area.As much as the conflict in Ukraine had erted attention away from the pandemic over the past month, the threat of Covid- has not fully passed.Doctors are have warned about a new wave triggered by social mixing and the rise of a more transmissible iant of Omicron called BA.. At the moment case rates among the elderly are at a record high, with one in  people over  in England infected. Although the vaccine has helped to keep the impact of those infections lower than in  and the start of , hospitalisation rates are now rising again. There are currently about , Covid admissions a day across the UK - a % rise on this time a month ago. Last week medical experts warned the pandemic was not over yet on a global scale. World Health Organisation official Margaret Harris told a conference in Geneva on Friday that it was “far from over”, adding: “We are definitely in the middle of the pandemic.”  The current situation is being fuelled by the BA. mutation, which could be of the most infectious diseases the world has ever seen, according to Professor Adrian Esterman. The epidemiologist and biostatistican says the iant is up to six times more transmissible than the original strain of Covid - and we can expect most people to catch it.While it is less deadly, BA. is a mutation of the Omicron iant of coronavirus and now accounts for the majority of new infections in the UK.BA.aposs R number, the rate at which it can spread, is , compared to . for the original virus. In a bid to dull the impact of the new strain, the government is rolling out fourth jabs for five million people. All over-s and those over  whose immune systems are weakened will have the chance to receive a fourth dose. The first , invitations will go out in the coming days.

When they were working members of the Royal Family, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle embarked on two royal tours together.The first was an action-packed trip to both Australia and New Zealand in , when the couple packed in  official engagements in just  days, including stops in Fiji and Tonga.It came following the announcement that Meghan was  weeks pregnant with son Archie - and despite the hectic pace she managed to keep up. But amid the formal dinners and royal duties, Harry and Meghan did apparently manage to sneak away to enjoy a completely secret evening on a double date in Sydney.In the biography Finding Freedom, it claims they spent their time off with Meghanaposs best friend Jessica Mulroney and her husband Ben, where they indulged in a luxury five-course dinner cooked by a private chef.The book claims: In Sydney to take on engagements and host the fourth Invictus Games, Harry and Meghan managed to sneak out for an evening off with Jessica and Ben Mulroney, the latter of whom was covering the Games for Canadaaposs CTV network.

Royal tours are now a thing of the past for Harry and Meghan, who in  quit royal le and now live in Calornia with their children Archie and Lilibet. However, last September the couple did make a number of appearances around New York City, which some compared to a royal tour.It marked Harry and Meghanaposs first public appearances since they quit as senior royals and moved from the UK to Calornia as well as Meghanaposs first appearance in public since giving birth to daughter Lilibet. And according to royal expert and author Duncan Larcombe, the trip could be a sign of things to come from Meghan and Harry.  He told Closer magazine : They essentially did a royal visit, like they used to in the UK – just on their own terms and in their own way. So it seems they have quit le in the UK to do exactly what they did here over in the States.“There will no doubt be a lot of meetings at the Palace and talks over how they are going to approach Harry and Meghan’s plans. This visit was a huge two fingers up to the royal family and shows the royal feud is far from over.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This means the Queen can take away gts given to Princes George and Louis, and Princess Charlotte,she wishesPrince Louis, Princess Charlotte and Prince George are the Queens great-grandchildren Image: POOL AFP via Getty ImagesByElizabeth HaighRyan FaheyNews Reporter:,  Mar |comments The royal family has a cruel rule which means Her Majesty can take away the gts sent to her grandchildren. The palace has a massive handbook of strict rules which the royals are expected to follow at all times - including some that seem particularly harsh on Princes George and Louis, and Princess Charlotte. They also have a seven-page handbook on gt protocol - detailing whether they can be accepted, when they must be ed or rejected, and how they are recorded, MyLondon reports.All presents given to the royals from outside sources are not owned by the recipient until they one day ascend to the throne. For example, a teddy bear gted to Prince George wonapost be his until he becomes King. Thankfully, the children can keep gts from their parents and other royals. So, Prince Louisapos Christmas and birthday presents from William and Kate are safe.  The royal familyaposs own rules state: Gts are defined as official when received during an official engagement or duty or in connection with the official role or duties of a Member of The Royal Family. This includes so-called walkabouts among members of the public, as well as official visits within the UK and overseas. But anything as small as a ribbon received as an official gt is the private property of the Queen, regardless of who received it. The guidance says: Official gts are not the private property of the Member of The Royal Family who receives them but are instead received in an official capacity in the course of official duties in support of, and on behalf of The Queen.In other words, the Queen is responsible for everything given to members of the royal family on official visits, because they are acting on behalf of Her Majesty. But as they are not owned by the member in question, they are not subject to tax as long as it complies with the familyaposs rules. You thought your parents were strict with gts  Think again. Even after the gt has been given, there is strict process for how they are handled after the engagement. All gts must be registered on an official Gt Received Form - think writing thank you letters to all of your relatives for every inidual item you have ever received from them. Although I doubt itaposs the family themselves that fills out the forms on this occasion.  If a gt is not used or consumed by the royal family it can be placed in storage or given to charity. The rules make clear that no offence should be caused to the donor, and waste must be avoidedat all possible.

From pm to pm on Tuesday in London, Brits could enjoy highs of C, Netweather predicts, and there is a chance of the same on Wednesday.How will you enjoy the weather  Join the discussion in the comment section  By comparison, weather predict that temperatures in Barcelona will only hit C on Tuesday - a while C lower.The UK will also be warmer than Monaco, Madrid and Lisbon this week. As the southerly winds continue to push northwards through Tuesday and Wednesday, those temperatures are going to surge signicantly, he said. Tuesday - a fine day with some sunshine - maybe a few isolated showers developing through the afternoon but most of you will have a dry day though.  Temperatures will reach a high of  degrees C in London,  degrees C in Glasgow and  degrees C in Belfast. Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, says it may be even warmer this week. He explained: We are expecting a very pleasant spell of spring weather. It is certainly going to bring the warmest spell of weather so far this year in time for the spring equinox.  We expect plenty of sunshine through the next week, and there is a chance that we see C in parts. There are also hopes that this warm spell lasts into next month, with odds for the warmest April on record tumbling. Coral now have the chances at -. Met Office verdictMeanwhile the Met Office told the LiverpoolEcho that much of the UK can expect to see more warm weather and sunshine this week.Forecasters said there are plenty of sunny spells to come and temperatures will rise a little bit in the week ahead, after a cooler Sunday. The mercury is likely to sit at C-C on Monday but Met Office forecasters are predicting highs of C on Tuesday before temperatures hold steady in most of England at around C or C through the rest of the week and into the weekend - warmer than the average for March. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThe vast majority of the UK is set to see continued sunny spells and dry conditions, with the exception of some localised showers in the North of England on Tuesday. The north of the UK is expected to see highs of between C and C. The pleasant conditions are due to the jet stream tracking well to the north of the UK, letting high pressure dominate from the east. Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said: This week is going to be very similar. Weaposre going to keep high pressure just to the east of the UK and that means it will be largely dry and settled with plenty of sunny spells. There is the odd exception, there could just be an isolated shower across the Midlands on Monday, perhaps northern England on Tuesday, but theyaposre going to be very isolated and most places will be dry and sunny. Mr Dewhurst added sheltered areas will continue to be on the pleasant and warm side. The temperature is expected to remain above average into the weekend but will then drop slightly into the following week.

The bizarre project, designed to connect his shed to his house, is the brainchild of inventor and YouTuber Colin Furze. He has worked on the remarkable back-breaking project for months removing an astonishing three-and-a-half tonnes of rubble a day. The -year-old, whose digging videos have each attracted more than six million views, has now finally connected the tunnel to his house in Lincolnshire and says it one of the most enjoyable projects he has ever done.He said: “It’s been one of the most talked about projects on my channel. “It’ a very cool project, everyone likes the idea of digging tunnels”, said Colin. “I do the projects that people really want to do but don’t have the time or money to actually make happen..  “I’m very lucky as it’s quicker to open my back door and walk to my shed, but it’s much more fun to use an underground tunnel and it means you don’t get wetit’s raining.” Colin started the tunnel under his shed floor in November  and it took him around a year to dig down to three-and-a-half metres deep, working on it when his neighbours were out so it wasn’t too noisy. He used a shovel and a bucket with a pulley system to hoist the rubble out of the hole as it got deeper.  He re-started the tunnel in March last year, using hydraulics to dig sideways through the earth and rock and aided by his mates Rick Simpson and Tom Lamb. As the tunnel got longer Colin even built a small mine cart and track to help transport the rubble out of the hole. He explained: “We had to dig the whole thing by hand as the tunnel goes underneath the foundations of my shed, garage and house. “It was very hard work but also one of the most enjoyable things I have ever done.  “We wanted to keep the noise down for my neighbours so used a shovel and hydraulics, which were really quiet.” The tunnel, which is . metres wide and two metres high and comes up in a cupboard in Colin’s kitchen, has been reinforced with steel and concrete.

In the lead up to their wedding and in the early months of their marriage, he stood at her side to guide her through official engagements, charity outings and private meetings with the Queen and the rest of The Firm. But according to body language expert Judi James, a subtle hand gesture from Meghan Markle proved Harryaposs role as guide and protector is now over and the tide has changed in their relationship. In their infamous interview with Oprah Winfrey, the couple sat side by side on garden chairs as they detailed their version of le within the royal family.  Meghan made accusations of racism and said the Duchess of Cambridge made her cry, while Harry said his brother Prince William is trapped and claimed his dad Charles cut him off financially. And Judi told The Mirror that their hand gestures show that while Meghan appeared confident, Harry was not and needed his weaposs support. She explains: I think when Meghan came to the UK, Harry very much saw himself in the role of overly protective husband that knew that all hell was going to break lose in terms of press and public interest, and was desperate to protect her - albeit that she presented herself as a very confident woman. But I think the tide has completely changed looking at the Oprah Winfrey clip. Now she seems to have taken a much more vulnerable Harry back to the US with her and she seems to be more in the role of rescuer and protector with him. This hand gesture that you can see, heaposs got his hand on the chair and sheaposs placed her hand on top.Thataposs almost a maternal looking gesture, itaposs though itaposs being used for reassurance and to let him feed off her confidence. Clearly sheaposs friends with Oprah, sheaposs used to being in front of the cameras sheaposs an actress, but to Harry this is a whole new world that heaposs being judged by and being asked to perform. And it sounds from the clip as though heaposs going to rip his soul out in front of the camera and tell us about everything. According to Judi, Meghan is sitting with a pit-bearing gesture which shows she is confidence. She explains: Meghan is just sitting there looking very demure, very regal I would say, very elegant. Sheaposs got the upturned V gap underneath her armpit which shows a confidence. When we feel like weaposre being bombarded with dficult questions or weaposre not comfortable women in particular tend to self-diminish, we bring out arms in. But with Meghan sheaposs got that super self-controlled, confident image going on here. However Judi believes that Harryaposs body language tells a very dferent story, saying it suggests he needs that support from his we. She said: Harry on the other hand is much less self-assured. He is sat diagonally and he kind of looks a lot more awkward. Highlighting that Harryaposs hand was on his crotch, Judi added: He is doing a male pose, heaposs got his hand between his legs. Itaposs called the fig leave pose, it is a very self-protective gesture. She highlights how dferent his body language is to when he was interviewed by James Corden. Here he looks way more guarded and a lot more uncomfortable and very much in need of that hand clasp that heaposs getting from Meghan.

She shared the results on TikTokThis is what Emii asked for Image: TikTok @emiiervineByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  Mar |commentsGenerally speaking, thereaposs not much that can go wrong with a manicure. All you need to do is pick the shape, the colour, the desiredof the nail, andyou want some extra fancy nail art that can be arranged too. The whole process happens in front of your very eyes so there are no nasty surprises. However, one woman still managed to walk away with a set that looked nothing like she had imagined. Emii Ervine went to the salon with an idea in mind and even turned up to her appointment with a reference picture to ensure there was no miscommunication on what she wanted.But when she walked out of the salon, she was so horried she had to share the results on her TikTok, @emiiervine.

Emii took part in a popular trend where users share expectations versus reality pictures, the first being the chic baby blue and pink marble design she asked for, and then what she was left with. The inspiration photo showed two of the modelaposs nails in one block colour and then the others were painted in a pink and blue marble style. But what she ended up with couldnapost have been further from what she wanted. The dusky blue colour had been switched out for a bright aqua shade and the marble design didnapost look marble at all. Since being posted, the video has been liked one million times, and has more than , comments from people who were stunned at the final result. One person said: Noooo girl, at this point just sue them. Another added: Did they go to jail for that day light robbery  Jail, a third wrote. Immediately jail. A fourth joked: This looks like when I used to put scotch tape on my nails as a kid to pretend I had nails.

The teenaposs account, @isseypovs, is simply made up of accessible apospoints of viewapos which lots of other teenagers find themselves relating to.Speaking exclusively with the Star, Issey spoke about how she managed to gain so many TikTok followers in a short period of time: I knew what was doing well at the time, so kind of followed that. I started a brand new account and began posting POVs, where you make up a story and match it to a song. I also made sure I mixed up my content quite a lot. Describing her content, Issey explained: I post a lot of relatable content that other teens can identy with. Thataposs why most people follow me I think. I share things about mental health, stuff at home, and just talk about stuff a lot of teens go through. With her online fame happening so fast, and at such a young age, the TikToker spoke about how sheaposs coped with her new-found popularity. Because I got a lot of followers in lockdown, I wasnapost really aware of how many people were seeing my videos, she admitted. People didnapost come up and ask for a photo, theyaposd just say hi, like a friend would.The youngster confessed some of her pals have found her new popularity a bit dficult though: Some of my friends were confused about it. I also couldnapost see them as much as I didnapost have as much free time, so that was a big change. Issey says her dad has been great about her social media stardom though, describing him as really supportive. When it comes to her online followers, Issey admits sheaposs had her fair share of hate although she thinks it may be because of her age. I do get quite a lot of hate. But itaposs not because Iaposm actually doing anything wrong. I think itaposs because of my age. People often treat me like theyaposd treat a friend in school, she said. They often think they know more about my le than they do, so they give opinions on my le that Iaposm not necessarily asking for, which can come across a bit aggressive. They forget theyaposre not my friend in real le.She says she never blocks anyone though as she thinks everyone is valid to their own opinions. Issey admits she does have a bad habit of answering back to trolls sometimes though: If they say a video is boring, I just tell them that they donapost have to watch it.When it comes to earnings from her social media accounts, Issey, who also boasts , on Instagram, says she doesnapost actually make any money from her TikTok.I donapost get money for getting a certain number of views or anything. I would feel wrong for it, the teen said. I donapost like getting gts online too as it makes me feel guilty. Issey instead says she gets money from brand deals. However, she says she only works with companies she actually likes or thinks her followers will like. She said: You can definitely make a living wage from it, depending on your lestyle. You can  percent you can live off it. Iaposve already moved out at . With such success, we asked Isseyshe would recommend the social media lestyle to other people her age. She admits she would have probably waited until she was older in hindsight. The star explained: I did start quite early on. If Iaposd have got to choose when I started, I would have started a little bit older. You canapost make mistakes on social media, so you have to mature a lot more than you would at that age. I wouldnapost recommend the lestyle to other people my age, just because of how much it can affect some people mentally. You really need to separate the what people you donapost know say to you from what people who do know you say. Despite social media being Isseyaposs main job right now, sheaposs hoping it can open more doors to other opportunities when it comes to her career down the line. Her dream job would be a runway model, which she has just started looking in to. She added: Iaposve always really wanted to do it since a young age, but I know itaposs quite hard to get into it.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Many do this by flooding their social media pages with glamorous photos and selfies to show their ex what theyaposre missing. But this plan is often scupperedthe ex decides to block or hide their account.After finding herself in this position, social media star Andrea Russett believes she found a way around it - claiming itaposs the ultimate form of revenge.Andrea, who has .m followers on Instagram, splashed out £ promoting photos of herself on the  so her snaps appeared on her exaposs timeline. Sharing her plan on TikTok to the sound of Patsy Clineaposs hit song Crazy, she wrote: The time I paid  [£] to have a selfie of myself promoted on Instagram directly to my exaposs demographic so he had to constantly see my face.Her fans were quick to praise her creative idea in the comment section. One wrote: I wish Iaposd thought of this after my last relationship. Another added I admire you for that moment, always lmao while a third wrote: This is crazy, how do I do it  Others were keen to try her cheeky idea herself, with one commenting: Me struggling to pay last monthaposs rent but still would do this.While Andreaaposs plan may have caused some upset, it probably didnapost do much long term harm - but one woman decided to get her revenge by spilling his work secrets to his boss. While working from home during the pandemic, the man worked out a way to shorten his working day from his paid eight hours into just two by using a database to do the calculations for him rather than working it out himself. This meant all he had to do was edit the workings out together. The man said he shared this info with his girlfriend, who worked at the same company, but then they broke up and she used it against him - sharing his screen with his boss and revealing how much time he spent slacking off.Taking to Reddit, the man said: After some time I broke up with her, we tried our best but I wasnapost feeling it as much as she was and I felt it would be better to end it sooner than later. The breakup seemed somewhat peaceful.Two days later I got called into HR at work for a disciplinary hearing. To my horror, I was presented with screenshots of my activity of the previous days: memes, trading activity, news reading, YouTube and even a tally of how many hours I actually worked vs how much I wasted. Turns out my ex shared my screen via Microsoft Skype when I went on a smoke break, recorded all my actions for the day and then reported me to HR. I shouldaposve actually worked my hours in, I shouldnapost have tried to impress my ex, and I definitely should have noticed my screen was being shared. The man went on to say that he almost lost his job because of the incident, but luckily he just hung onto it.Do you have a story to share  Email yourmirror@trinitymirror.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Relationships\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Image: GettyByZoe ForseyFeatures Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments Nothing beats a full English breakfast, especiallyyouaposve got a slightly sore head from one or five too many pints the night before.Sausage, bacon, egg, beans, mushrooms, tomatoes, hash browns and toast with a massive dollop of brown sauce or tomato sauce - perfect. But one bloke was left traumatised after his tasty breakfast arrived with a few extra additions - and to be honest, we agree with him. Frederick Payne went out to eat in Hampshire with a pal who kindly treated him the £ meal, but he was left questioning the kind gesture when it arrived. Sitting on the grey plate next to all the normal fry up items were slices of fruit and some rocket. The melon, pineapple, grapefruit and orange are beautully sliced and arranged in order of side, meanwhile the rocket is mixed with pomegranate. Do you think this is an acceptable breakfast  Have your say in the comment section below. Taking to Twitter to share his outrage, Frederick said: My mate thought that buying me breakfast in this place would be a good idea #traumatised.He later added that was now reevaluating the friendship, saying: £ in Hampshire this was, luckily my now ex-mate paid for it. People were quick to share their views on the unusual addition, and itaposs fair to say the majority werenapost impressed. One wrote: I am of the belief that they could [have] an excellent full English Bacon cooked well sausage and mush look great scrambled egg too So they can cook But they choose to f*** around and serve that up Probably charged a ridiculous amount too They should be struck off. Another added: I hope youaposre no longer friends. A third simply commented poison while another wrote: Itaposs a fruit salad. WTF   According to a study in , the perfect fry up contains two sausages, two rashers of bacon, fried eggs, mushrooms, toast, beans and fried tomatoes - and red sauce. Fried bread and black pudding are also considered essential for the ultimate breakfast, the poll of , adults discovered. But settling the age-old sauce argument, ketchup was the most popular condiment, with  per cent saying this is a key ingredient in a cooked breakfast, compared to just  per cent who go for brown sauce. It also emerged the average Brit tucks into an English breakfast twice a month - and more often at home than in a cafe. Francesca Woodward, spokesman for High Street TVaposs QuadraPan, said: Itaposs great that our results show how much people love tucking into a classic English breakfast. And we were also pleased to see that people prefer to make them at home, rather than heading out to a caf or restaurant. This way, people can be sure of exactly what quality of ingredients and equipment is being used to make breakfast just the way they like it. The Full English is most often enjoyed on the weekend, with two thirds tucking in on a Saturday or Sunday morning - with Tuesday the least popular day. Toast was twice as popular as fried bread as an accompaniment while grilled tomatoes were preferred to fried - although one in four prefer theirs without tomatoes at all. Fried eggs were the most popular choice, with a whopping  per cent of the vote - leaving scrambled behind on only  per cent.

One man did exactly that, by turning to his older sister and asking for help paying for his wedding, which she was happy to oblige. However, the man is now being heavily criticised, after it was revealed he has since uninvited his sister from the celebration altogether - but still expects her to pay, According to their mum, the siblings - -year-old John and Rita, , get on fairly well, but arenapost particularly close, despite the fact Rita has financially taken care of the family for a number of years.

As Sam has a huge family, theyaposve already taken up a big proportion of the guestlist, and John has been forced to reduce the name of guests on his side, which his mum says is no issue for her or Rita. However, her future daughter-in-law recently discovered that one of her long-lost childhood friends would be in town at the time of wedding, so she wanted to invite her. However, with the venue already full to capacity, they had to choose one guest to uninvite from the wedding to make room for her, and the couple recently announced that person would be Rita.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.

Since sharing the story online, other Reddit users have been quick to blast John and Sam for being so ungrateful for Ritaaposs efforts. Sam is showing your family how controlling she is. Shame on your son for throwing his very generous sister under the bus, one Reddit user commented. You did right. It’s hard to know when to speak up, but Rita was getting bullied and she, as such a giver, needed your support. Another agreed: Your son is very wrong for how he is doing his sister. It is amazing that she was able to step up and help you both out when she didnapost have to. Itaposs a huge shame that her brother is doing her this way and treating her like this.

The couple agreed it was important to them for one parent to stay at home as they both had absent parents due to work and felt neglected in their childhoods, so wanted to ensure it would be dferent for their own kids.We decided Iaposd be the parent to stay home because he has a much higher paid job which is enough to support a family on, which Iaposm alright with it because having a parent at home is something thataposs really important to the both of us, the -year-old woman wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.However, we made the mistake of not discussing the topic of prenups previously. He assumed because he comes from a rich family and has a highly paid job, Iaposd automatically understand that a prenup was expected. Whereas I didnapost expect anything because I genuinely forgot all about that topic, which was probably ditzy of me. I am just so in love with this guy and want to marry him that I didn’t think anything of the what--we-break-up situation which was naive of me, I know. The woman told her future hubby, , that she doesnapost want a prenup as sheaposll be giving up her career to raise the children, meaning sheaposd be left with absolutely nothing financiallythey ever were to split up.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I come from a poor background so my parents wouldnapost be able to support me aside from letting me and my kid sleep on their -seater couch, which isnapost a good look for custody agreements, she continued. So I gave him a compromise that Iaposd sign the prenup but I wouldnapost quit my job to be a stay at home mum, but he still insists that I sign the prenup and be a stay at home mum. The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether she was justied in refusing to both sign the prenup and agree to give up her career. So he wants you to give up your financial independence in order to raise a family with him, but also wants to make sure youaposre not legally entitled to any of his wealth should things not work out  Absolutely to NOT sign this, one Reddit user commented. Another added: Be careful. Him wanting to leave you with nothing might be an indication of how heaposll feel about finances while youaposre married. If you’re going to be a stay at home mum, is he going to share finances and give you full control over money that youaposll need for yourself and the kids  Or is he going to act like itaposs all his money and you aren’t doing anything to contribute  Take care of yourself. A prenup isnapost a bad thing, but him wanting to leave you with nothing after insisting you give up your career is concerning.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The Security Service of Ukrainesaid the troops, also known as Kadyrovites, had ed to Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. The organisation claimed that the soldiers had been pulled out after suffering large numbers of deaths in the first three weeks of the war.Reports of Chechen troops participating in Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine began in the first days of the Russian invasion on February .On February  a video began circulating of Chechen servicemen hoisting a Russian flag on a military unit building in Gostomel, a village  kilometres northwest of the Ukrainian capital.  The Armed Forces of Ukraine authenticated the video, but denied the claims within it that they had fought off three Ukrainian advances - saying that the area invaded was empty at the time. A day later, three days after the invasion began, commander of the st Motorized Regiment of the Chechen Rosguard, General Magomed Tushayev, died.During efforts to land at Gostomel airport from February  and , several hundred Chechen fighters lost their lives, SBU intelligence officers say. A large column of what appeared to be Kadyrovites fighters and military machines was then filmed in Bucha, north of Kyiv.Subsequent video emerged of airstrikes being launched at it and the wreckage of many of the army vehicles. Ramzan Kadyrov, President of Chechnya, initially denied casualties among his fighters, but on February  he acknowledged the deaths of two Chechen servicemen, while not giving their names. Unfortunately, there are casualties among the natives of the Chechen Republic. Two died and six others were injured, he wrote on Telegram. Claims from both sides regarding lives lost and the current location of troops are dficult to very, given the contested area in which the Chechens were operating. According to SBU counterintelligence, on March , the Kadyrovites were evacuated from the territory of the Kyiv region via Belarus and further by air to Chechnya. At the same time, Kadyrov announced that he was sending a thousand more of his fighters to Ukraine.  Footage that has emerged in the last few days suggests that there are at least some Chechen fighters still involved in the invasion. On Tuesday, Kadyrov announced that his fighters were leading the attack on the city of Mariupol, having entered Ukraine from the east. He published a video which showed a number of soldiers firing at the upper floors of a building that had been hit by an airstrike, before they are seen appearing to help people evacuate.Ukrainian troops have taken to taunting the Chechens, who come from a predominantly Muslim part of Russia.Ukraine’s National Guard posted a video of fighters from the Azov Battalion, some members of which were accused of committing potential war crimes by the United Nations in , greasing bullets in pork fat and warning them to go home.

This is despite dominant British company Reckitt - maker of Durex and other brands - continuing to trade in the country even while slamming the war in Ukraine as “unconscionable”.The country’s largest online retailer Wildberries saw condom sales jump  per cent in the first two weeks of March compared with last year. Major pharmacy chain . reported a  per cent rise in sales. Overall, there has been a  per cent boost in the value of chemist condom purchases compared with a year ago.And supermarkets said their sales were up  per cent, reported RBC. Yesenia Shamonina, co-owner of the Prezervativnaya sex shop, said: “People are buying for the future, despite the fact that we were forced to raise prices.” Costs to the consumer had risen by up to  per cent depending on the brand, she said. Outlets are forced to pass on price increases caused by the sinking value of the Russian rouble against key Western currencies.This was due to collapsing confidence in Vladimir Putinaposs economy after he launched the invasion of Ukraine. An industry source said that while Latex comes from countries which are not applying sanctions, they must buy in Western currencies which are now far more expensive . The rush on condoms was so great that Putin’s Ministry of Industry and Trade was forced to issue a denial that there would be long term problems. “A shortage of this product is not predicted,” insisted officials. “The largest producing countries - Thailand, India, South Korea, and China - have not stopped deliveries of products to the Russian Federation.” Traditionally, Russia imports  million condoms a year, and produces  million.Reckitt employs around , people in Russia and makes in the region of £ million annually in this market. “As the situation continues to evolve, we will continue to take action and respond, always acting with the appropriate duty of care to our employees,” said the company in a statement. Sexologist Yevgeny Kalgavchuk urged Russians to use “good condoms” from “friendly countries” rather than those made in Western markets imposing sanctions. Business expert Pavel Spichakov said that  per cent of the condom market in Russia is owned by foreign companies. “An English company Reckitt, which produces the brands Durex, Contex, Hussar and others, accounts for over  per cent of it,” he said. He did not expect Reckitt to leave despite the walkout of Russia by other Western firms. “There is no hope that the company will voluntarily leave the Russian market,” he said. Butthey were forced out, Russia could boost its own production, he said.

The critics say: “Despite the current war, Switzerland continues to host an accomplice of Putin’s regime.” It added that it was time for the neutral country “to take action” and send her home to Putin, .Kabaeva is seldom seen in public - but was caught on video dancing in Moscow in December amid fears Putin was planning to go to war in Ukraine. Recent reports have claimed she is seeing out the war with her rumoured children in a mountain retreat in Switzerland.“We, the citizens of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, which is currently undergoing immense suffering, are uniting to appeal to the Swiss authorities,” states the petition in German, French and English and posted on change.org, so far signed by almost ,.“The public has just learned that the Russian political and media figure, and former [rhythmic gymnast], Alina Kabaeva, is hiding the consequences of the sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation in your country.  “She is the favourite we of [the] delusional dictator and war criminal who has been treacherously attacking Ukraine over the past weeks. “As she is supportive of social activities in Russia, she has been attempting to get Russian citizens accustomed to the reality of sanctions after , and personally proclaimed: ‘The worse it gets, the better for us!’” The signatories question why “given the volume of sanctions placed on Russia” the authorities continue to host her and her family at a time when Putin “is destroying the lives of millions”. The West has so far not sanctioned Kabaeva - although as well as being Putin’s rumoured secret partner, she is also chairman of the board of directors at National Media Group, a major Kremlin-obedient TV and newspaper behemoth, at a salary of almost £ million a year. The petition tells the Swiss: For the first time in modern history, your country has violated its neutrality, which it did not even do vis-à-vis Nazi Germany in the th century, and joined the sanctions against Putin and his surroundings.“And now you are allowing his favourite mistress and her children to hide within the borders of your state.” There is as yet no independent evidence that Kabaeva, a former pro-Putin MP, is hiding in Switzerland, where she was rumoured to have previously given birth in the country. It adds: “We want to remind you that Alina Kabaeva is not only a woman who stained herself with an association with the Russian dictator, but also a criminal against humanity. “In particular, she was among the initiators of the draft law, which in Russia was called the “law of scoundrels” or “the law of Dima Yakovlev. “This shameful move deprived thousands of Russian orphans of the possibility of being adopted abroad. “Consequently, many applications already open at the time for the adoption of seriously ill children were canceled and applicants for qualied medical care simply died. “Alina Kabaeva, [then] a member of the State Duma [parliament], obediently approved any unconstitutional initiative of President Putin, which later became almost genocidal against the internal population of Russia.”  They call for the Swiss to “investigate very carefully the legal basis on which she is present in your country. It adds: “Please consider it especially against the backdrop of sanctions imposed on her as a top executive of Russian propaganda media. “Please decide whether the residence of this inidual in your country is warranted. “We also ask you to check the ‘cleanliness’ of the funds used for the purchase of real estate in Switzerland, of which this person uses. “We will seek justice in any way possible, andthe fact of corruption of inidual political officials of Switzerland is found out, which has allowed Alina Kabaeva to obtain citizenship bypassing all procedures, then we will ensure that this information isn’t kept a secret. “At times like this, filled with tremendous uncertainty, you must be severe with your actions and in regards to the beneficiaries of Putinaposs regime!“It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer!” Separate reports suggest Kabaeva is not in Switzerland but at a hi-tech underground bunker in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. Political scientist Valery Solovey, , linked to the Telegram channel, said earlier this month: “In fact, it is not a bunker, but a whole underground city, equipped with the latest science and technology.” He warned: “I hope this means something to you  “That the President sends his family to this bunker.” In her only statement linked to the war, Kabaeva slammed the refusal to allow the Russian team to compete at the Beijing Paralympics.  “There has never been a more shameful page in the history of world sports,” she said. “They did not worry and did not remove from the competition any country that participated in the destruction of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. “But sports officials were very angry when Russia decided to protect the Donbas and Luhansk from the Nazis. She complained that Olympic officials “tried so hard to humiliate the Russians, banned our symbols, flag and anthem”. But still Russians succeeded due to the talent of our athletes. “Russia was, is and will be a great sports power - and you canapost do anything about it. Rumours first linked her romantically to Putin as long ago as  when she was a pro-Kremlin MP. Tabloid Express Gazeta recounted in May when she was still out of sight: “She literally vanished. “After the giving-birth-to-twins reports nothing was heard about Kabaeva, asshe had disappeared. “Alina is not giving interviews, nor attending social events, nor participating in any TV programmes. “One can only guess what is happening in her private le.” Putin - who in  announced his orce from we Lyudmila, a former Aeroflot stewardess - has previously said: I have a private le in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected.” He deplored those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into othersapos lives”. Kabaeva is on record as saying she had met a man who I love very much”, gushing: Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared. However the Russian media - including her own newspaper and TV group - throws no light on whether they are or were a couple. In  Kabaeva was temporarily banned from competing in rhythmic gymnastics after failing a doping test. A year earlier she had won gold at the  summer Olympics. Once regarded as Russia’s most eligible woman, the only other suitor she has been linked to by the media was a married Georgian policeman. This relationship petered out in  amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her le. She once posed almost nude for Maxim and was described as “full of sex” by a photographer. There have been many reports of her wearing a wedding ring, but no records of a marriage. She is reported to have a fleet of Maybach limousines at her disposal, and was seen surrounded by a squad of machine-gun toting security guards on visits to a Moscow cafe. Many Russians saw her as the reason for the breakup of Putin’s marriage to ex-first lady Lyudmila, , mother of his two adult daughters. The dictator of neighbouring Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko hinted that Putinaposs orce decision came about because Kabaeva put pressure on the president.

He took to his cellar, which acted as a bomb shelter, with his one-year-old pet poodle Jeffrey. Douglas, from Poole, Dorset, has now made an extraordinary escape and is safely in the Czech Republic with his beloved Jeffrey. He told the Mirror: “It was horrible, horrible, horrible - I can’t forget it.”  Douglas is a company adviser and a former business consultant who moved to Kharkiv ten years ago. He said as the bombing started his we left without him and left him stranded so he and Jeffrey headed to the basement. He said: “The we was gone, so I said, well, here we go – itaposs only the two of us left, my boy. “He was very nervous of the explosions and especially when it got very near. “He’s always been a super boy and slept with me. He means the earth to me.” Douglas went on: “The problems started when gas shut off and the electricity kept coming and going - leaving me in the cold and dark. “My neighbours would bring cooked meals over, when the bombings stopped – a kindness I was deeply grateful for. “A couple of times I tried to get out and make short trips, but one incident soon put an end to that.  “On Saturday, just about a week since the war began, I started getting out of food so I decided to go to the supermarket. It was still open. “I went there, parked the car and walked five steps from the car and it went boom. Cluster bombs! “Just at the back of the supermarket - they were aiming for the Military Hospital nearby. “Those cluster bombs caused big explosions. That unnerved me. “I became increasingly desperate but managed to contact my family in Britain and a friend in Czech Republic, who arranged for my escape, with a family of builders. “That entailed a three day car journey via “backroads” in Ukraine, coming to Moldova and eventually to Trutnov, in Czech Republic. “I aim to stay, instead of ing to the UK. All this time, Jeffrey has not gone farther than two feet from me.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Russia Ukraine warDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up saturday march 5 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe new shinty season got up and running with goals galore across the country on Saturday March .Fort William  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from two goals down to earn a - draw with Fort William in their pm throw-up at An Aird.Kyles travelled with just  players following Robbie Macleod’s late call-off as former Lochcarron player Liam Arnott made his competitive debut for the Cowal outfit.Both keepers # Paul MacKay for Fort William and Kyles Athletic’s John Whyte # made good saves before the hosts took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Cam Stephen.Victor Smith made it - a couple of minutes after the re-start.Kyles got a goal a couple of minutes later through Arnott, his bouncing shot deceiving Paul MacKay.The goal lted Kyles and Conor Kennedy made it - with  minutes remaining, punishing the Fort defenders for not clearing their lines.Kyles laid siege on the Fort goal as they went all out to get the winning goal but to no avail.The sides were also playing for Drew Ferguson Memorial Trophy, won by Fort William after a penalty shoot-out.Inveraray  Glenurquhart Inveraray, relegated from the Premiership at the end of the  season, drew - with promotion hopefuls Glenurquhart at the Winterton.Both goals came in the first half, with Glenurquhart’s Conor Golabek netting on  minutes and Campbell Watt drawing Inveraray level on  minutes.Col Glen P Bute PThe meeting between Col Glen and Bute was called off on Saturday morning when the pitch at Glendaruel failed an inspection.Kilmory  Inveraray After winning the league in , Kilmory welcomed the Inveraray second team to MacRae Park.Joe Anderson got the Lochgilphead side off to a great start with a goal after  minutes, but Euan McMurdo’s th minute strike saw the score level at the break.Ewan Donnan scored what proved to be the winner on the hour for Inveraray.Strachur-Dunoon P Uddingston PThe match at Strachurmore between Strachur-Dunoon and Uddingston was postponed due to lack of pitch preparation time after recent wet weather."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

a French poet, Charles Baudelaire,Best wishes.Living in a Campbeltown flat, one up from the street, with only one flat above using the same toilet waste downpipe, I was amazed tohome to find a

On their advice, I called Scottish Water to report the situation.Their officers attended and completed the clearance into the main drain.It is encouraging to hear that the water companies are taking action to attempt to prevent other householders from sharing my horrible wet wipes experience.Following the recent report from the Public Audit committee, I am calling for a review of governance structures, especially in relation to the Crofting Commission.Crofting in the Highlands and Islands is a huge economic driver that retains people and fights against depopulation.To see that no real improvements have been made to improve the Crofting Commission since concerns were firstly raised is disappointing and concerning and I would like to see this urgently addressed to avoid this occurring again.That is why I believe it would be best to review these governance structures so that the roles within the Crofting Commission – and other bodies – are clear and that its relationship with its board and the Scottish Government are clearly defined."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 4 2022","story":"Teachers of wisdom spring up like weeds after rain.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

I stood by it and hoped that the story it once told had been caught before the words finally vanished.I showed Suu the jougs which hang at the entrance to the kirk: a metal collar attached to the wall by a chain.Here its victims would be chained up, humiliating them and exposing them to the judgement of other members of the community who deemed themselves morally superior, or at least hoped their own transgressions would never be discovered.It was the poor, of course, who were subject to such humiliations, and women in particular, not the rich and powerful men who made the rules they set for others.As we stood by the kirk, I told Suu the well-kent tale of the Rev John Kello, who was minister at Spott after the Reformation.A memorial to the women ly executed as witches Despite his pious pontications and apparent high moral standards, he murdered his poor long-suffering we Margaret because of greed. He then tried to make it look like suicide.The fact he stood in the kirk, giving a sermon on morality, holding the Bible with the same hands which he had used, just an hour before, to strangle his we to death, is breathtaking in its horror and hypocrisy.But actually at the heart of this crime is misogyny, a contempt and hatred of women, which was, and is, far from unusual.Kello was eventually caught out and confessed that is the unusual part of the story, not the murder. Women regularly died at the hands of partners and, despite changes and progress, they still do.The jougs were just part of that system of misogyny, a terror of humiliation that dangled before them as they went to church, a reminder that they had a place set for them by men they best not challenge.I took a photo of the jougs and accidentally caught Suu’s shadow as well.The image seemed symbolic of the many women history has forgotten, or didn’t even notice, who remain unnamed shadows in the events catalogued by self-important men.Further down the road, there is another place which shows the final societal conclusion of this perception of women: the Witches’ Stone.Jougs at Spott Parish Church It stands on a site where, it is said, women were horribly executed for the trumped-up crime of witchcraft as late as .There is no space here to get into the debate about which women actually met their end here, and when, and what the evidence tells us.There are times that historical pedantry is promoted on this issue, usually by men, which ignores the very real horror of these events.Suffice to say, this is a location that bears the memory,not all the names, of many women who were persecuted by a system and ideology which had misogyny at its heart.There are statistics, of course: , accused of witchcraft in Scotland, the vast majority women, with evidence that more than , were actually executed, many in or from East Lothian.The real number will be more, and even then statistics don’t tell even half the story.Many of those accused who managed to avoid being ‘worrit’ at the stake will still have had their lives ruined in so many ways. They will have lived with the vilication and suspicions.None of these women were guilty of being witches who had made a pact with the Devil.That was nonsense.They were mothers, healers, midwives, grandmothers, poor servants, old women, young women, usually poor women many were convicted on evidence we would now recognise as compassion and care for others.They were victims of the misogyny cast in the iron of the jougs. Their real crime was being a woman.That’s why I support the move by the Scottish Government to have a full legal pardon for all those who suffered from the insane brutality of the witch hunts. Men were victims too, but it was overwhelmingly women.It’s not just about historical justice, it’s about recognising that while, thankfully, times have changed a lot, they still haven’t changed enough.Misogyny isn’t historical, it’s very current and very real today, all over the world, as well as on our doorstep.That’s why a national monument would be a good idea too, in addition to recognising the local memorials such as the one at Spott, and in my home town of Prestonpans.They need to be made accessible too, not tucked away on a dangerous corner of a road where there is no safe place to stand and remember.And let’s stop calling the women witches, because they weren’t what they were accused of being.And as we commemorate their persecution, let’s also celebrate their role in society, their bravery, their talents and contributions."},{"url":null,"title":"schoolchildren-visit-scottish-parliament-first-time-since-pandemic-began","story":"Students visited Holyrood as part of the Scottish Parliament’s education visits programme to learn more about the work of MSPs – a trip that was not possible for almost two years due to coronavirus restrictions.Two Higher modern studies classes attended Holyrood last Tuesday and were met by Martin Whitfield and Brian Whittle, South Scotland MSPs.Mr Whitfield, who was previously East Lothian’s MP and a teacher at Dirleton Primary School, was delighted to welcome the pupils to the Capital.He said: “The suspension of public visits to Parliament has been one of many disappointing impacts of the pandemic over the last two years.“It was a pleasure to meet the Knox Academy students and answer some of their questions, and I look forward to welcoming many more young people from other local schools over the course of this parliamentary session.”S pupil Mara Popa described it as “an amazing experience for everyone” and said: “During this time, we were able to ask our MSPs questions about what an MSP does, committees that they are members of, and how they can hold the Government to account.”"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-1997-1972-1922","story":"THE school bell was ringing for the last time for Dunbar Grammar School’s headteacher, reported the East Lothian Courier on March , .Will Collin today walks through the gates of Dunbar Grammar School for the last time as headteacher.After almost  years in the senior post, and five years before that as assistant head, he is taking early retirement at the age of .Explaining his decision, Mr Collin said: “I feel I am ready for retirement and putting my feet up.”Born and raised in Eyemouth, he began teaching maths and physics at the high school there in .Five years later he moved to Arbroath before coming to Dunbar as assistant headteacher in .Following an -month sojourn as the deputy head of Selkirk High School in the early s, he ed to Dunbar in .Looking back over a career spanning three decades at the school, Mr Collin, who lives with his we Val in Rosebery Place, said: “The best part of the job is working with young people.”...and  years agoVandals created ‘a reign of terror’, told the East Lothian Courier on March , .A wave of vandalism in East Lothian recently was likened to a “reign of terror” by a county official this week.He said damage amounting to almost £, had been done to a pavilion in Prestonpans.“We are fighting a losing battle,” said Mr George B.

That would be undemocratic.I trust Peter A Russell, since he backs the proposal, would apply the same supermajority to all proposals in the referendum – status quo, independence or “other”. But that won’t happen, and the whole nonsense just sounds like imperial rules from a century ago.I have the gravest doubts that a fair Scottish referendum can take place under the media rules proposed by the UN for “territories” Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by this Tory Government seeking independence. The media is entirely Anglo-centric and unionist. The BBC that operates in Scotland lacks the bandwidth, forum or journalistic quality to debate anything, never mind independence.As Margaret Thatcher stated, negotiations for independence should start when a majority of pro-independence MPs are elected from Scotland. That would also sideline a whole lot of angst and bitterness.GR Weir, Ochiltree.SNP FOCUSING ON WRONG ISSUESNICOLA Sturgeon would have us believe that she is in tune with what “the people of Scotland” want. Clearly not. Time after time, surveys show that on top of the majority not wanting separation from the rest of the UK, a clear majority do not want the Government to be wasting time, money and effort on preparing for a referendum. How many civil servants are tied up preparing the latest fictional release called a White Paper  Could they not be put to better use getting accommodation and support in place for our homeless and those in poverty as well as helping with the Ukrainian work Not on the First Minister’s watch. All she wants is the headlines and the photo opportunity of helping Ukrainian refugees and to keep dangling the carrot of a referendum just over the next hill. The Ukrainians deserve all the help they can get from the many countries around the world offering support. Our own most vulnerable deserve help too.Theresa May said it was not the time a few years ago, pre-Covid and pre-Ukraine. What will it take for Ms Sturgeon to get the message that she is focusing on the wrong issues Jane Lax, Aberlour.WHY HAND THE KEYS TO BRUSSELS DESPITE wars and energy crises your Letters Pages still contain many missives from both pro and anti-independence camps.There is almost no doubt now that the referendum proposed for  is a non-starter. If those who are massively in favour of independence will draw some breath and admit this then perhaps a more basic question can then be answered. Does independence mean what it says or is it inextricably linked to handing the keys and responsibilities to Brussels Calling for an independent Scotland is simply wrongthat independence is promptly given away. The very word \"independence\" ought to be the centre of the debate and, as such, the answers from the nationalist side must include solid solutions to the currency, debt, pensions, national bank, interest rates and borders issues, not wish lists.Europe comes later,at all, so membership is simply conjecture based upon how well Scotland doesindependent. The current world situation does not favour small non-aligned countries, nor will this change in the foreseeable future. This needs very much to be taken into account. We are better together.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.DEFINING A WAR CRIMINALPRESIDENT Biden has publicly called Vladimir Putin a war criminal, a charge undoubtedly accurate given his bloody actions in Ukraine. The number of innocent civilians murdered on his orders is now well into the thousands and will continue to grow so long as this war continues.Let us not forget that Russia was at no time threatened by Ukraine nor was ever likely to be this was simply an invasion to reclaim territory ly claimed by Putin to belong to Russia. He calls Zelenskyy a Nazi and seeks \"denazication\" yet it is Putin, like Hitler, who invaded another nation’s sovereign territory it is Putin, like Hitler, who is a dictator it is Putin, like Hitler, who has total disregard for human le. Yes, Putin is a war criminal all right, and should be convicted as such.But let’s back up a moment. President Nixon together with his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, in illegal direct defiance of Congress, indiscriminately bombed Cambodia and Laos, two countries not involved in the Vietnam War. They unfortunately just happened to be in the way. Half a million innocent civilians from each countrywere killed by bombs dropped from Bs with barely a word of protest that I can recall. Nixon is dead but Kissinger, now , still lives a le of contented luxury in the US. No retribution for him.Then there are George W Bush and Tony Blair, both partners in a \"coalition of the willing\" although in direct defiance of the unwilling majority of the population of the UK, who, on the flimsiest of pretexts, bombed and killed more than , innocent Iraqi civilians. For Mariupol in Ukraine read Fallujah in Iraq.Putin is a war criminal and must be held to accountKissinger, Bush, and Blairalso have civilian blood on their hands and should be arraigned immediately, not that that is likely to happen.A war criminal is a war criminal, a dead civilian is a dead civilian their provenance is irrelevant.Bob Buntin, Skelmorlie.UN AND NATO HAVE FAILED USOVER the last three weeks, the United Nations has shown itself to be an impotent and toothless organisation, serving solely as an elite members club for the well-paid representatives of national governments, whoseis to provide a mouthpiece of their respective governments on the world stage. Both the Security Council and the General Assembly have failed to achieve unanimous condemnation of Russia’s illegal war or the illegal targeting of civilian targets and hospitals.We are one minute before midnight on the path to World War Three, yet the UN has spectacularly failed to achieve its prime and founding objective of preventing war. Even the mighty Nato, the worlds strongest military force, has cowered in the face of Vladimir Putin’s expansionist war and its crimes against humanity.Surely now is the time to rethink the purpose and usefulness of these dysal and bureaucratic organisations that have failed Ukraine, failed democracy, and failed the world.Ian Forbes, Glasgow.FOLLY OF A NUCLEAR ARSENALWHEN there is a war on, its convenient to criticise the SNP-Greens alliance for their Nato- and nuclear-sceptic stance .Any rational person opposes nuclear weapons, especially those parked in Scotland’s backyard. The shared consequence of radioactive fallout are only too obvious from the  Chernobyl explosion.Russia wisely took back its Ukrainian-based weapons when pro-Nato independence was declared.The other eight nuclear countries are the US, the UK, France, Israel, India, Pakistan, China and North Korea with a collective total of , bombs. Only one of those countries has used such weapons on innocent civilians, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The US kindly shares its nuclear arsenal with other countries, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Turkey.It is a bit like saying the gun lobby acts as a deterrent for shooting incidents.Malcolm Macqueen, Fairlie.MASKS DID NOT DO THEIR JOBDAVID Clarkclaims that the current spike in Covid cases is due to people not wearing masks.

All the grammar and language that we now take as read was invented in a few short years. How could you not be excited to see that  I’m still amazed by it.”McGann’s presence was one of the highlights of this year’s festival. Hippfest, as it is known, ed to the town’s Hippodrome cinema, the oldest purpose-built movie theatre in Scotland for its th year.“This is the first in-person Hippfest in two years because of the pandemic,” the festival’s director Alison Strauss pointed out. “The opening night of the th edition [in ] was the day of the national lockdown.”“Hippfest and the Glasgow Short Film Festival were the first two casualties.”Support from Screen Scotland and the Cinema Recovery fund ensured that the festival could keep going. Last year Straus and her team managed to mount an online festival last year, but there has been a renewed appetite these last few days for the film festival, she said.“People are still nervous. There are high rates of Covid. But people have come back,” Strauss said of this year’s festival. “The vibe in the auditorium is that people are up for it. They like being out and in company, sharing that communal experience that people have been missing so much, I think.”Film critic and musician Mark Kermode, with his band The Dodge Brothers, and composer and musician Neil Brand ed to perform at this year’s festival, renewing a long association with the festival, but McGann was the cherry on the cake. How did Strauss convince him to come to Bo’ness “I met him. I went to the San Francisco Silent Film Festival and saw him or rather heard him narrate the intertitles for this incredible film L’Homme du large. I was a bit starstruck, but somebody gave me a boot up the backside to go and talk to him and so I did. I told him about Bo’ness and the Hippodrome, and he agreed to come.”The actor has been involved in working with silent films for more than a decade now and his love of silent cinema goes back to his childhood and watching early films on television.“I remember even as a kid being hugely impressed by them and I still am. I’ve never lost my love and admiration for them.“This is pure cinema.”As a student he saw Louise Brooks in the remastered version of the  silent film Pandora’s Box and was hooked. “That’s why I’m talking to you today,” he said.“And some of the actors were the equal of any who ever lived. I know. I’ve tried silent movies.”In  McGann made a short silent film with Frances Barber called Listening, he explained. It was written and directed by Kenneth Branagh and shot in Branagh’s own home.“No dialogue. And we struggled,” McGann admitted. “How do you do it  At the end of it, the three of us sat there and thought, ‘If we didn’t know before we know now. Some of the best actors who ever worked were working before .’“That kind of skill is lost. So, I can say I tried it for three days and I was lousy at it.”McGann has himself just recovered from Covid. “I only just got out of my bedroom on Friday,” he said. “It floored me actually.”But he’s been keen toto narrating at live events such as Hippfest. “I like working with musicians. Audiences like seeing live stuff. The restorations themselves are masterpieces.“Everybody’s missed it. A lot of live events went to the wall businesses didn’t survive. Now these things are back on. This is cultural le blood. It’s so important. Musicians want to play. People like me want to yack over it.“But we all want to be in the same room. We want to be doing it live. It’s great.

These should include training and recruitment, the availability of sub-contracting and supplier opportunities, and that it is intended to improve the economic, social or environmental well-being of the area.If no community benefits are sought in a contract, a statement must be published on justying the decision.When CMAL announced the Turkish shipyard firm as the preferred bidder no benefits to any Scottish community were listed.CMAL says that as the contract has not been officially awarded yet, it cannot provide any detail about the bid.Now it has emerged that CMAL has amassed £,. in overseas travel over the last five years. It was spending an average of £. a month over six months during the Covid pandemic in  and  having previously forked out £. a month in the five years before the virus restrictons.Alba Party deputy Kenny MacAskill criticised the spend.“CMAL’s remit doesn’t extend beyond the Minch but they’ve run up almost £, in overseas travel since  and struggle to sail the seas they’re supposed to serve,\" he said. \"This even includes periods when foreign travel was precluded through lockdown. \"It’s bad enough that CMAL are giving contracts for ships that should be built in Scotland. But it’s adds salt to the wound that whilst the ships they’ve provided for remote communities lie idle, berthed or being repaired, they’re jetting around the globe.”Ministers have previously been warned that they may have acted unlawfully by failing to give nationalised shipbuilder Ferguson Marine a look in for a £m contract to create two new leline ferries to serve Islay.The Turkish yard won in front of four overseas companies to bid for the contract to build the two vessels - and excluded the Inverclyde shipbuilder.Finance secretary Kate Forbes has stated that in line with the Procurement ReformAct , bidders for the Islay procurement process were required to detail the community benefits they are able to offer within their response to the invitation to tender.Submissions from the four yards were evaluated including the responses to the community benefits section included within the original contract notice.Ferguson Marine which runs the last remaining shipyard on the lower Clyde was nationalised after it financially collapsed in August , amid soaring costs and delays to the construction of two leline island ferries.It came five years after tycoon Jim McColl first rescued the yard when it went bust.The delivery of new island ferries MV Glen Sannox and Hull , which were due online in the first half of , was found to be between four and five years late, with costs doubling to over £m.Earlier this year it emerged that the completion of the long-overdue ferries had been delayed again.The Islay route is already one of the busiest services for freight on the Clyde and Hebrides network, and CMAL says that the incoming ferries will support the island’s vital economic activity.The four shortlisted shipyards were to submit their technical and commercial proposals for the design and construction of the two vessels.The successful initial bids were from Damen Shipyard in Romania, Remontowa Shipbuilding in Poland, and Turkish shipyards Sefine Denizcilik Tersanecilik Turizm, and Cemre Marin Endustri.It was confirmed Ferguson Marine embarked in a bid for the contract through the initial Pre-Qualication Questionnaire process but failed to make the shortlist.A CMAL spokesman said that Mr MacAskills comment demonstrated a \"profound lack of understanding of CMAL’s role and the work we do to support Scotland’s ferry infrastructure – including the Northern Isles, beyond the Minch\".The spokesman added: “We have spent considerable time in past years searching the global second hand market for ferries to bring resilience to the fleet. It is vital that our vessels team inspect these ferries first hand to assess their suitability for the network.“We also visit shipyards during the evaluation stage of the new vessel procurement process to correlate the bid response from each yard with their reality, and attend factory acceptance tests for machinery. In terms of travel during lockdown, ferries are a leline service and many of our team were given critical worker status during the pandemic to maintain infrastructure.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12618339.jpg?type=article-full","title":"covid-rules-lifted-scotland-monday","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed last week that from today many remaining restrictions will end. However, the move comes in the wake of figures from the Office for National Statistics showing levels of Covid infection in Scotland have hit another record high. Businesses such as bars and restaurants are no longer required to retain customer contact details.The legal requirement for firms, places of worship and others to “take reasonably practicable measures” set out in Scottish Government coronavirus guidance is also being ended.: New infection record set as infections soar across UKHowever, the legal requirement to wear face coverings in shops, hospitality venues and public transport remains in place.Case numbers have now risen for seven weeks in a row, with , people likely to have had the virus last week – or one in  – up from one in  people the previous week.The surge in infections prompted the First Minister to row back on plans to scrap the legal requirement to wear face coverings on public transport and other indoor settings.This had been due to be converted to guidance – with the situation to be reviewed early in April.However, with the other restrictions being eased Labour called for action to help the economy.The party wants adults to be given high street vouchers to get people spending again – but also says there should be a public information campaign so that people can be confident about theto public places.Holyrood finance spokesman Daniel Johnson said: “Businesses across Scotland will breathe a sigh of relief as restrictions are lted today – but there is no room for complacency.“The challenges facing Scotland’s economy didn’t start with Covid and they won’t end today.“The cost of living crisis will pile added pressure on to businesses, as people cut costs to try and make ends meet, but once again the SNP and the Tory governments are failing to get to grips with the challenge.“We need real action to get our economy moving again and undo the lasting damage done to our high streets by both the pandemic and by  years of SNP mismanagement.“This means clearer communication and more ambition from the SNP government.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use.

Obviously it’s crazy it is the first year the team have played together, but you can see the progress already. I think over time when the team gels together more there is even more to come.“This shows what direction the club are going in. The players we have brought in, how we play, it just shows what we have got for the future so the club is going in a good direction.”Zaha’s comments will be welcomed by everyone associated at Palace, especially as he approaches the final  months of his contract.The Ivory Coast international assisted Mateta and grabbed his th goal of the campaign in the win, the third time he has reached double figures in a season.Boss Vieira has often talked up Zaha’s contribution off the ball and did similar regarding the recalled Ebere Eze, who made only his fourth start of the season in the cup success following his recovery from a serious Achilles injury last May.“Ebs has been training really well and was waiting for that kind of opportunity to play,” the Palace manager explained.“Unfortunately he didn’t play very much but it is just because the players in the midfield were doing really well. He has still kept working hard, been working well and that was his opportunity.“I think he did really well. He played with a lot of personality and what I was pleased about with his performance was the work he did out of possession.“We all know what he can do with the ball but that part of the gamehe needed to improve. I think he did it really well and now that has to be consistent. The best way for him to be consistent is to keep playing games.”Everton lost for a fth time in seven matches and new boss Frank Lampard quickly turned his attention to helping the club avoid a first ever relegation from the Premier League.The Merseyside outfit go into the international break only three points above the bottom three.“The job is to stay up, that’s the reality of it,” Lampard admitted.“If you offer any Evertonian before the game ‘do you want to win and get to Wembley or stay up ’ we know what the answer is.“Maybe it is not Everton’s time, or not my time as Everton manager to be there at Wembley.“Crystal Palace have been together for a while with the manager since the start of the season and have invested in important areas of their squad and team where they knew they had to, so it is their time and not ours.”"},{"url":null,"title":"health-secretary-urges-older-people-top-up-covid-vaccines  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .

However, sacked workers and unions have expressed disgust at the way the firm has behaved.Nearly a quarter of PO Ferries’ UK staff were told via a pre-recorded video message on Thursday that it was their “final day of employment”.It comes despite the fact the company received £m of government assistance throughout the pandemic to enable it to furlough staff, which has led to calls for the PO tothe cash.Read MoreLabour to force vote on boosting workers’ rights in wake of PO sackingsUnion representatives set to brief Stormont on legal plans against PORelated topicsLarne FCMore On Larne FCLarne need to stick together and start picking up momentum for play-off push, maintains midfielder Lee LynchNine-man Larne show grit to hold on for draw against Carrick Rangers, but miss chance to climb above Crusaders into fourthLarne boss Tiernan Lynch urges his side to rediscover killer touch as race for Europe gathers paceIrish League matches should be played across whole weekend, says NIFL chief Gerard LawlorBen Dickinson praised by Sir Alex Ferguson after raising over k meals for Marcus Rashford’s charity with walk to Manchester UnitedMost ReadPaul McKenna: Grieving widow tells of her last moments with DJ husbandAbuse victim died of Covid- before Belfast paedophile faced justiceBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familyDUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly electionWoman accused of cutting out partner’s chest tattooTop VideosPlayThe public should not be “scared” about rising energy prices in the Autumn- Rishi SunakPlayVideo: Crystal Palace cheerleaders sexy dance routine to Icona Pop#s I Love It PlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandWoman described as ‘serial abuser of partners’ accused of cutting out partner’s chest tattooStormont liaising with Irish Government over refugeesNI Royal Navy veteran to auction off his sailing boat in order to raise funds for Ukrainian refugeesRates bill for empty schools is over £kAmbulances failed to reach , critical patients on timeLatestJavid vows to seek more help for vulnerable hit hardest by rising pricesOne in five expect to be driven into problem debt this year, says charityBritish-US national detained by Iran now on hunger strike, says sisterIrish transport minister to speak to Ryanair about refugee price hike claimsHong Kong to lt flight bans on UK and eight other countries,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Gareth FullerJohn BreslinMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFreight operators and passengers were scrambling on Thursday night to switch plans following the sudden mass sacking of  PO Ferries employees, including dozens of skilled crew operating the Larne-Cairnryan route.The company announced the action via a video message, then sent private security staff — some wearing body armour and balaclavas, and carrying stun guns and handcuffs — to remove staff from the European Causeway docked in Larne.Sailings on the route are now suspended for at least five days and possibly a week, prompting concern over a serious disruption to the supply chain.Around  lorries use the route daily, many of them carrying perishable goods on what is the shortest Irish Sea crossing.Captains, engineers, electricians and other skilled deck and engine staff were sacked on Thursday, including around  operating the ferries between Scotland and here.They were immediately replaced by cheaper agency staff, unions said. Other workers, mostly hospitality and already employed through agencies, remained on board.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreThey have treated us all like c**p, says -year PO veteranMargaret Canning:OpinionPO Ferries: Operator of busy link with Scotland recorded £.m profit in , but other factors at play hereWhile PO was silent on Thursday night on why the services are suspended, it is believed the new crew needs to be trained up and may require the green light from maritime regulators to sail.Fears were growing among the approximately  to  Port of Larne ground staff employed directly by PO.East Antrim MLA John Stewart said they had heard nothing from the company as events unfolded quickly on Thursday, adding that the crew members were “treated despicably”.PO, owned by Dubai-headquartered conglomerate DP World since , said it had to take the action because the company was not “viable” after posting losses of £m in the last financial year.The sackings came two years after , staff were made redundant at the same time investors were paid a £m idend, which the company said it was legally obliged to disburse.“Our survival is dependent on making swt and signicant changes now. Without these changes there is no future for PO Ferries,” the company said.“These circumstances have resulted in a very dficult but necessary decision, which was only taken after seriously considering all the available options.”Unions representing the seafarers told members to stay on board, but those stepping off the ship said they had little choice but to leave after being confronted by the security staff and warned they were trespassing, and that the redundancy package would be withdrawnthey did not do so.Local politicians reacted with shock at the developments. It also caught industry insiders completely by surprise.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson, who spoke with chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite, said he was assured the jobs of ground staff at Larne were secure, but added he was “appalled” at the treatment of the seafarers.“The way in which staff were removed from the ships is totally unacceptable and is not how any employer should treat their employees,” Mr Wilson said.“Despite operating purely between UK ports, PO will now be paying Third World wages to their crew.“This raises serious concerns about the company’s morality.”Immediate clarication is needed over the future of Larne Harbour, East Antrim Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said.“Given PO owns Larne Harbour, urgent questions now need asked as to the potentially vast impact locally,” Mr Dickson said.Passengers, hauliers and cargo are being redirected to Stena Line ferries, with the company saying it is trying to accommodate but is extremely busy. It confirmed it was trying to accommodate those booked on the PO ferries between Scotland and Northern Ireland.“Most freight companies have accounts with all ferry operators and they are doing what they normally do during periods of disruptions and move via alternative routes operators where space is available,” Stena Line said.Logistics UK, the trade body for freight transport, warned there will be disruption but that those in the business of moving goods were flexible and used to quickly switching methods, either using other ferries or,needs be, air transport.But Seamus Leheny of the organisation said: “This has just come out of the blue... really shocked the industry.”Rail, Maritime and Transportunion general secretary Mick Lynch said: “We are seeking urgent legal action and are again calling for the Government to take action to stop what is fast turning into one of the most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations.”Tom Long of law firm Shakespeare Martineau said: “PO’s decision to fire  staff with immediate effect appears to contravene the requirements needed for a normal mass redundancy.”Related topicsJohn StewartAlliance PartyStewart DicksonMore On John StewartJohn Traynor, Ballycastle man who died in Carrickfergus work accident, ‘a very, very popular inidual’Birth Mothers, which represents mother and baby homes victims, urges Stormont to act on ’s recommendations PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionProtocol meeting: Stormont ide is clear in discussions with EC vice presidentDoug Beattie includes Mike Nesbitt and John Stewart in UUP spokespeople changesDoug Beattie includes Robbie Butler and Andy Allen in UUP leadership team Most ReadPaul McKenna: Grieving widow tells of her last moments with DJ husbandAbuse victim died of Covid- before Belfast paedophile faced justiceBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familyDUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly electionWoman accused of cutting out partner’s chest tattooTop VideosPlayThe public should not be “scared” about rising energy prices in the Autumn- Rishi SunakPlayVideo: Crystal Palace cheerleaders sexy dance routine to Icona Pop#s I Love It PlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandWoman described as ‘serial abuser of partners’ accused of cutting out partner’s chest tattooStormont liaising with Irish Government over refugeesNI Royal Navy veteran to auction off his sailing boat in order to raise funds for Ukrainian refugeesRates bill for empty schools is over £kAmbulances failed to reach , critical patients on timeLatestUK could welcome hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees, says JavidWilfried Zaha sees ‘even more to come’ for Crystal PalaceJavid vows to seek more help for vulnerable hit hardest by rising pricesOne in five expect to be driven into problem debt this year, says charityBritish-US national detained by Iran now on hunger strike, says sister,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government

controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely

extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting

We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three.

Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

show.They danced a sultry tango to Rio by Duran Duran with judge Arthur Gourounlian commenting after: ldquoMatthew, you brought the passion of Rio to the dance floor tonight.Fellow judge Brian Redmond said: ldquoYou started with intensity, commitment to the movement... its just the face thats missing at this stage, your body brought us on the journey.Loraine Barry, another judge, said: ldquoI like this Matthew, I felt you got yourself in the correct tango position.They scored  from the judges but they picked up extra points in the team dance for their group,Turkish Delights, were victorious.These points, combined with the public, kept Matthew safe from the dance-off.Nicolas Roche became the latest celebrity to exit as he and dance partner Karen Byrne lost out in this weeks

intense and there is a lot of pressure because yoursquove got the whole nation watching you and yoursquove got the producers and your fellow contestants watching and you donrsquot want to let the

I had no expectation coming into it.\"I was never a performer, never danced in my le so it was a whole new world. Going into the show Irsquom rsquo \" so I never expected myself to be a good dancer, Irsquom not saying Irsquom a good dancer now but Irsquove definitely improved leaps and bounds since I started.ldquoIrsquom really buzzing at how far Irsquove progressed and hopefully Irsquoll keep that going and improve further from here.He said that he has found the physical demands of dance quite challenging and that his body is breaking down now.ldquoItrsquos constant because yoursquore twisting your body in new ways.

The practice has recognised both the need for change, and the opportunity that new ways of working provides to improve the quality of care which it can offer to its patients.ldquoShe is an outstanding example of the dedication and professionalism of our GP services.The minister also thanked all of the practice staff or their ldquotireless and ongoing treatment, care and support that they provide to patients, particularly over the past two years.He added: ldquoI know it has not been easy. This has been an incredibly stressful and anxious time for so many of our population and no less so for our GP workforce and their teams who have been in the vanguard of our response to Covid.South Down UUP councillors Jill Macauley and Alan Lewis also paid tribute to Dr Smith.ldquoAlison has served the community of Clough and Dundrum with such attention and dedication over the years, and we have no doubt that her presence will be missed in the local surgeries, their statement said.ldquoWe thank our party colleague and Health Minister Robin Swann MLA for taking the time to call with Alison and all the staff at Clough Health Centre to acknowledge her retirement, as well as seeing around their impressive state of the art facilities.Dr Smith and her husband moved to the Newcastle area in  when he got a job at the YMCA.Originally from Edinburgh and having qualied at Edinburgh University, Dr Smith spent a short time working on the surgical ward of Downe Hospital with Mr Crawford Bell, consultant surgeon.She then worked part-time with Dr Edith Cunningham in Killyleagh and Dr John Kyle in Newcastle before joining the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice as a partner with Dr Kieran Walshe and Dr Alex Greer in .

This is history that we have actually been living and working through which has been good to have been part of that. But I definitely feel ready to move on and itrsquos time for new doctors to be in the practice.She said it was the speed of change that the practice had to contend with at the beginning of the lockdown that proved challenging.ldquoThere is always change in general practice and some of it is not easy but having to work safely through the pandemic while providing a service to our patients was challenging but I think we managed to do that.Dr Smith, who has three adult children mdash Alistair, Sandy and Corinne mdash added that it has been quite emotional for her saying goodbye to her patients over the last few weeks.ldquoThey are like old friends and it was good to be part of their lives.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe independent report, published by campaign group Keep Wales Tidy, is described as the first report of its kind since the start of the COVID- pandemic.  It recorded , littered face masks during the period and it said PPE litter, which was included in street cleanliness surveys for the first time, was present in eight per cent of streets. The ‘How Clean Are Our Streets’ report brings together results from thousands of street cleanliness surveys and is intended to give a ‘snapshot’ of litter and other environmental quality issues.  It only covers streets and doesn’t include parks and green spaces. The report found litter related to smoking is the most common type, found on . per cent of streets. While the report outlines the continued challenge of litter, and its prevalence across the nation, it also reported that recorded dog fouling is at its lowest level since street cleanliness surveys began in - and was present on just eight per cent of streets. Litter from confectionery, including sweet wrappers and crisp packets, was found on nearly half of streets and drinks litter remained at pre-pandemic levels and was found on  per cent of streets. Keep Wales Tidy has highlighted the results as supporting its calls for the implementation of Extended Producer Responsibilityin the UK which would place new duties on packaging producers to pay for the treatment or disposal of their goods. The charity, and other environmental groups, believe that would encourage producers to reduce waste and promote more sustainable product design as, it says, is in the case in many European countries. Keep Wales Tidy chief executive Lesley Jones said a public consultation has demonstrated support for such a scheme:  “The prevalence of littered packaging across Wales further strengthens the case for EPR. The responsibility for tackling litter does not rest solely with local authorities and the financial burden on the public purse must be reduced.” .removeWelsh Government deputy climate change minister Lee Water said it agrees with the principles of extended producer responsibility and will make an announcement in “due course”. The street surveys cover a six per cent sample of streets, selected at random, from full lists of adopted highways provided by each local authority.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA comprehensive - win over Everton in the FA Cup quarter-finals continued the Eagles’ fine debut campaign under their new manager.Vieira has kept Palace comfortably away from the relegation zone all season, despite a summer of upheaval, and now has a date at Wembley to look forward to after goals by Marc Guehi, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Zaha and Will Hughes extended their unbeaten run to six games.“We’re looking forward to it,” Zaha told ITV when asked about the prospect of an FA Cup semi-final at the national stadium.“It’s amazing. Obviously it’s crazy it is the first year the team have played together, but you can see the progress already. I think over time when the team gels together more there is even more to come.“This shows what direction the club are going in. The players we have brought in, how we play, it just shows what we have got for the future so the club is going in a good direction.”Zaha’s comments will be welcomed by everyone associated at Palace, especially as he approaches the final  months of his contract.The Ivory Coast international assisted Mateta and grabbed his th goal of the campaign in the win, the third time he has reached double figures in a season.Boss Vieira has often talked up Zaha’s contribution off the ball and did similar regarding the recalled Ebere Eze, who made only his fourth start of the season in the cup success following his recovery from a serious Achilles injury last May.“Ebs has been training really well and was waiting for that kind of opportunity to play,” the Palace manager explained.“Unfortunately he didn’t play very much but it is just because the players in the midfield were doing really well. He has still kept working hard, been working well and that was his opportunity.“I think he did really well. He played with a lot of personality and what I was pleased about with his performance was the work he did out of possession..remove“We all know what he can do with the ball but that part of the gamehe needed to improve. I think he did it really well and now that has to be consistent. The best way for him to be consistent is to keep playing games.”Everton lost for a fth time in seven matches and new boss Frank Lampard quickly turned his attention to helping the club avoid a first ever relegation from the Premier League.The Merseyside outfit go into the international break only three points above the bottom three.“The job is to stay up, that’s the reality of it,” Lampard admitted.“If you offer any Evertonian before the game ‘do you want to win and get to Wembley or stay up ’ we know what the answer is.“Maybe it is not Everton’s time, or not my time as Everton manager to be there at Wembley.“Crystal Palace have been together for a while with the manager since the start of the season and have invested in important areas of their squad and team where they knew they had to, so it is their time and not ours.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Wilfried Zaha sees  ueven more to come u for Crystal Palace article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This can be accessed online at nhs.uk covidvaccine or by calling .Rollout of the booster has already started in Wales and Scotland.It comes as the NHS in England has been told to prepare for a -week autumn Covid campaign from September to December.The NHS England planning document says the health service should prepare for a “minimum scenario” to offer vaccination to groups  to  as set down by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .This includes care home residents and staff, frontline NHS and social care workers, people deemed at risk due to underlying health conditions plus all those aged  and over.A “maximum scenario” includes everyone aged  and over.The JCVI has said an autumn jab campaign is likely to be needed to protect those most at risk of severe Covid.Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast the JCVI has said “it’s possible there will be an autumn booster campaign, probably for those that are  and over, but they haven’t yet made a final recommendation on that”.He added that, despite rising Covid cases, the Government’s “level of concern hasn’t changed”.He said: “Our level of concern hasn’t changed and that’s because, although case numbers are rising, infections are rising and indeed hospital numbers are rising, they are still way below their peak.“And it’s also important for us when we review this, to understand why they are rising and that is primarily due to the increased social mixing we’re seeing after the country’s opened up, but also the BA. sub-iant of Omicron which we know is on the one hand more infectious but, on the other hand, we know that our vaccines work just as well against this sub-iant..remove“And so, taking all that into account, of course we keep the data under review, but there’s no particular cause for concern at this point.” vw,vw,px, px\"Health Secretary Sajid Javid said spring boosters ‘will help top up the immunity of the elderly’ Speaking to Times Radio, Mr Javid said , people in English hospitals have Covid- but the majority of them have not been admitted because of the virus.He said the NHS “estimates almost % are not there because of Covid – they are there for something .”He added: “That might be a hip operation or something, but they happen to be Covid-positive.”The Health Secretary stressed, however, that people with Covid symptoms should “socialise a bit less, stay indoors” and and wait until they feel better.He said it would be down to the inidual to decide whether or not to take a test after free testing for all adults in England ends on April .“Post-April people have Covid symptoms, then they should just behave sensibly – like you would expect someone to really behavethey had flu symptoms in the past – and that is to socialise a bit less, stay indoors and and wait till you feel better,” he said.Mr Javid said there was a “need to step back and think about how we learn to live with Covid and focus on our very best form of defence and that’s the vaccination programme”..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Health Secretary urges older people to  utop up u their Covid vaccines article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Exhibitors will include Flood Marine, McAlinden Boats, Swim Ireland, Royal Yacht Association to name but a few, and it will be packed full of activities from fun and interactive workshops, to on the water demonstrations and experiences.“We’ve hosted successful events for over  years now, including the Ireland Angling Show in Dublin, so we honestly believe that the increasing passion and interest in marine leisure over recent years calls for a bigger and better show.“For those interested in perfecting their techniques or learning about new products, the show will feature talks from a range of experts in all areas of the marine leisure sector, while also giving guests the opportunity to chat to professionals and visit our exhibitor stands.“We are also delighted to have the support of Lisburn Castlereagh City Council who recognise the enormous potential of Northern Ireland in providing these kinds of homegrown holiday activities.“This is a very lucrative market for everyone in the wider tourism industry and from this exhibition alone we estimate that around £, will go into the local economy. Northern Ireland has so much to offer with quality accommodation and catering, superb activity facilities and of course unparalleled access to water be it lakes, rivers or coast, said Hugh.”Officiating at the event launch and welcoming it to the city, Alderman Amanda Grehan, Chair of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, said that this is exactly the kind of event to show off the versatility of their tourism offering.“Eikon Exhibition Centre which is conveniently located beside the main arterial routes to Belfast and Dublin is now a signicant centre for International events being held in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It will draw in thousands of visitors and millions of pounds in consumer spend and sectoral investment.“Supporting events like this is a core part of our economic strategy for the council area demonstrating that we are also a critical economic generator benefiting the whole of Northern Ireland.“The countdown has now started, and I look forward to visiting Ireland on the Water Expo next year. It will be a true partnership across the marine, tourism, accommodation and hospitality sectors,” said Alderman Grehan.Details on further activities will be announced over the coming months and you can check out our website www.irelandonthewaterexpo.ie or follow us on social media @IrelandonthewaterexpoIf you would like to know more about the Expo please contact us here, email [email#protected] or telephone Grace Mc Dermot, Mara Media Sales Manager, on +  .Northern Ireland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularSuspected petrol bomb attack at County Tyrone house...NewsNI strike: school buses, bin services, leisure centres and o...NewsAlcohol taken from youths in response to anti-social behavi...

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .
