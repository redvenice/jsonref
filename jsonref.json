[{"url":null,"title":"Kanye Wests stepfather reveals rapper confident prodigy genius child","story":"    Kanye West\u0027s \u0027stepfather\u0027 has told DailyMailTV that the outspoken rapper has always had an ego as he reveals that the \u0027prodigy genius child\u0027 had a slight speech impediment and had dreams of becoming a baseball player          Speaking to DailyMailTV, Blakeley says that from a young age Kanye\u0027s talent was \u0027off the scale\u0027, saying he was \u0027a prodigy genius child from when I first set eyes on him\u0027          Ulysses Blakeley lived with West and his mother Donda throughout the musician\u0027s childhood.   The 67-year-old watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago    Ulysses Blakeley  was one of Donda\u0027s last true loves before she died after a botched cosmetic surgery operation in November 2007Blakeley said Kanye would rap in poems all the time instead of speaking normally, even for the most mundane things, like passing the salt at the dinner table. \u0027We installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does artistically or poetically. So he would speak to you in poems, and sometimes, he\u0027d talk in riddles, and it would be like: \u0027\u0027Stop that now\u0027\u0027. But we tried not to be like that,\u0027 he adds.Although Blakeley says that he doesn\u0027t know how much influence he had on West\u0027s music and art, he does admit: \u0027How much of Kanye was innate and nothing to do with us? It might have been us or might have been the environment we created. We were both musical, writers, and cultural. Did that provide the path to wherever he is?\u0027 Although West was different, he didn\u0027t get bullied and would stand up for himself, a trait he shared with everyone in his family.\u0027He was a tough little kid, not bully-able in any way, shape or form. I remember one time he was out in the park, a boy who was ten or eleven, and Kanye was only five, took his Frisbee and threw it in the tree,\u0027 says Blakeley.\u0027Kanye told him to get it down, but this boy just played around with him, so Kanye socked him, pow, he kicked his a**, regardless of his size. There\u0027s not this intellectual, nerdy reticence in him. There\u0027s nobody in his family like that, they\u0027re forthright and aggressive.\u0027But the family did go to church and Sunday School every week. Donda says in her book that they\u0027d attend Christ Universal Temple in Chicago, a black megachurch on the South Side: \u0027I wanted Kanye to be steeped in that kind of exposure to God.\u0027It\u0027s a little known fact that West also went to a \u0027positive thinking\u0027 kindergarten for black children called the New Concept Development Center, where he was taught Swahili by Donda\u0027s trusted friend and fellow professor, Haki Madhubuti.          The star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island (pictured) - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247          Blakeley said him and Donda \u0027installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does\u0027When Donda and West went to China, they traveled to Thailand, frequenting the red light district of Bangkok and visiting nude beaches on Koh Samui. They also slummed it in the infamous Chungking Mansions, in Hong Kong, a ghetto block, notorious for its sex workers and drug peddlers.According to her book, Donda reveals: \u0027Once, Kanye and I literally took the slow boat from Canton to Hong Kong, where we\u0027d spend two weeks before going on to visit Thailand. \u0027In Hong Kong, we stayed in what became known as Slum King Mansion. The bath was down the hall and the room was definitely no-frills. The cost was eleven US dollars a night, if that tells you anything.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027If Donda was alive he wouldn\u0027t be married to...Jay-Z insists he WASN\u0027T dissing Kanye West over his Trump...\u0027Congrats on influencing all your fans\u0027: Shock as teetotal...Share this article\u0027When we got to Thailand we visited Bangkok first. Kanye went right along to the red-light district with me. From there it was on to Koh Samui. The beaches there are some of the most beautiful in the world. \u0027I was totally embarrassed, though, when one of the professors (also a Catholic priest) asked Kanye what was the favorite part of his holiday. Kanye answered: \u0027\u0027The nude beaches in Thailand\u0027\u0027.\u0027But this is nothing compared to the revelations that Donda reveals about West\u0027s sexual habits when he was approaching his teenage years.She wrote: \u0027I talked with him about it, like I talked with him about everything. There was no topic that was off limits, not even sex. When he was twelve, that conversation came up.\u0027It was my time to car pool and Kanye was in the car along with two of his friends. Jocelyn Elders came on the radio and, as I remember it, she was talking about the rise of teenage pregnancy.\u0027  Blakeley said: \u0027He was a little boy, preschool. He was off the scale. One time, someone asked him when they were looking at his drawings: \u0027Do you want to be an artist when you grow up?\u0027 He said: \u0027I am an artist\u0027. The ego\u0027s always been there!\u0027          Donda revealed in her book that she encouraged Kanye to masturbate rather than having sex with girlfriends at a young age. She added: \u0027I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so\u0027Donda continues in the book: \u0027That\u0027s when I told Kanye and his friends that masturbation was a far better alternative to having sex at such a young age.  \u0027I told them it was perfectly healthy, normal, and gratifying and that they did not have to participate in sex with another partner and risk some young lady getting pregnant or contracting a venereal disease, not the least of which was AIDS. They said nothing.\u0027They just sat there anxious for us to get to school I\u0027m sure, so they could get out of that car. I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so.\u0027After coming back from China, the pair moved home several times.          Blakeley had a special relationship with West, Donda revealed in her 2007 biography, Raising Kanye, which was published just before she diedThe star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247.Donda reveals: \u0027Kanye spent hours and hours mixing, rapping, and writing. It was nonstop. He became so involved that his socializing revolved around that studio in his room.\u0027That thumping bass line seemed to shake the very foundation of our house. Boom-boom-boom day and night. There were all sorts of people coming in and out of the house. \u0027Mainly it was the thundering bass that was no longer welcome—not all day and all night, anyway. I finally had to say to Kanye: \u0027You\u0027re moving\u0027.\u0027Another of his former homes, a tiny, rundown apartment on Lake Bluff Drive, Tinley Park, is where West saw the apparition of Christ - Yeezus meets Jesus!Donda reveals: \u0027One day Kanye was playing in the dining room of our first home in Chicago, a third-floor apartment on the South Side. \u0027All of a sudden, he looked toward the door and the staircase leading down. He pointed and said, \u0027Look, there goes Jesus!\u0027 My heart raced. I saw energy.           Blakeley watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago (pictured)  The house was meant to be turned into a community center for the youth, but arguments between a charity named after Donda and Kanye means it hasn\u0027t happened yet\u0027To this day, I believe it was Christ giving us just a little extra protection that day. Neither Kanye nor I have spoken of it since.\u0027But it was very real to me and just one of the reasons I think Kanye is connected in a special way or for a special purpose. God has chosen him to not only reach but also touch millions.\u0027 Kanye\u0027s first job was as a busboy collecting plates at the American diner chain Bob Evans.Although, according to Donda, \u0027he decided immediately that bussing tables was not something that would work for him. He quit on his first day before he even started.\u0027When West finally broke onto the music scene, he moved to New York, where he found an apartment at the Hudson Tea Building, in New Jersey, directly across the river from Manhattan, as can be seen in our images.\u0027We rented it, sight unseen. It was $850 a month, with a living room and a step-up great room with a glass ceiling. You could actually look up and see the sky. It was wonderful. And Kanye was inspired...\u0027Kanye loved that place. He called up his friends and said, \u0027Man, you should see this place. It\u0027s like something off of TV.\u0027 Kanye was exactly where he wanted to be. He was on his way to fulfilling his dream,\u0027 says Donda in her book.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Owner gift wraps cat puts bow head second year running","story":"    Scooter the cat sits on the wrapping paper under his tree at home on the Gold Coast, AustraliaGinger cat pounces on squirrel and kills it in shocking...Share this articleAnne moves him into the middle of the paper and gently pulls the sides  up, covering the plush three-year-old cat.Scooter\u0027s confused face is left peeping out of the front of the wrapping paper as Anne sticks the sides together and says: \u0027not too tight on the best present ever.\u0027She then tucks his tail in and tapes up the bottom of the cat parcel. She says \u0027you\u0027ve got to use high quality paper\u0027 before moving onto the front and tucking the paper back behind Scooter\u0027s head.Scooter keeps on looking ahead and remains calm throughout the wrapping process, even when his owner covers his paws up.

Samantha is pictured right with Meghan years ago          Dooley also revealed he remains extremely close to his grandfather Thomas Markle (pictured in June), who he described as a \u0027loving teddy bear\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the hardest part, the fact that there is no privacy. It is hard to deal with.\u0027 Dooley revealed he is currently estranged from his father, who earlier this year released a public letter begging Prince Harry not to marry Meghan. \u0027The only family I have left now are my mom, brother, and grandfather,\u0027 Dooley said. \u0027We are still close and fine but for the rest of my family, their lives are lived out in the tabloids and that is the hardest thing.\u0027 \u0027I have to read what\u0027s going on in my family in the news because I don\u0027t even speak to them.\u0027 While Dooley hasn\u0027t spoken to Meghan in three years, he defended his aunt and said she doesn\u0027t deserve the way Samantha and his father have spoken about her. \u0027Meghan has always been a hard worker,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know she focused on her passion and trying to make a name for herself.\u0027           Meghan (pictured age 11) is seen next to Dooley, her father Thomas Markle Sr, Dooley\u0027s brother Thomas, and Samantha Markle \u0027She was a young girl with big ambitions. She wanted to make history. It was like me when I went to college. It wasn\u0027t that I didn\u0027t want to talk to my family. I just didn\u0027t want to be distracted.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know exactly what has gone on but there\u0027s no justifications for Samantha\u0027s actions.

He always went above and beyond and brought the joy and birthdays and Christmas.\u0027 \u0027He is a very kind man and showed us all a lot of love. Even more for Meghan. He bent over backwards for her.\u0027 Dooley described Thomas Markle as a \u0027loving teddy bear\u0027 who was a \u0027very good parent\u0027 to the future Duchess of Sussex. \u0027Whether that contradicts reports that are out, I don\u0027t care,\u0027 he said. \u0027Because I can tell you on record he is a very kind, caring, loving person who adores Meghan. \u0027I would stand by that every day of the week.\u0027 Dooley hasn\u0027t met his aunt\u0027s husband, but only has nice things to say about Prince Harry and hopes he might one day meet his future cousins. \u0027I am a fan of Prince Harry.

(stock image)Before I describe her reaction, I should explain for the benefit of younger readers how things stood at that particular moment. We’d been through a social revolution whose outcomes now are entirely taken for granted. The young, I’ve noticed, tend to act as though nothing has happened.They have little or no sense of history. The miracles worked by previous generations — they’re as ordinary as life itself. But as everyone who takes an interest should know, the entire debate began innumerable centuries before, with Plato perhaps, or with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, or with Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, or the speculations of Alan Turing, or when, at the dawn of the third millennium, a computer program, learning from its own mistakes by way of deep neural networks and ‘self-play’, defeated a Grandmaster at the ancient Chinese game of Go.Or, most significantly, when the first android became pregnant by a human and the first viable carbon-silicon baby was born. Only three streets away from my apartment, in a delightful little square lined with cafés and shaded by pollarded plane trees, there’s a statue in Molly’s honour.You would think that there was nothing unusual in such a monument. Except that a pretty girl of eight in T-shirt and jeans, hands on hips, stands boldly before us on a plinth in place of a general, or a poet or an astronaut.Could a machine be conscious? Or put another way, were humans merely biological machines? The affirmative answers to both questions consumed many decades of international wrangling between neuroscientists, bishops, philosophers, politicians and the general public.Finally, long after it was due, artificial people were granted full protection under various human rights conventions. So too were their mixed-source off-spring.Other rights properly followed, including benefit of marriage, property ownership, of passports, voting and employment protection. An android could start a business, get rich, be bankrupt, sued, and murdered as opposed to destroyed.Around the world there developed various ‘autonomy’ acts which made it illegal to buy or own a manufactured person. The legal language self-consciously invoked the anti-slavery acts of the nineteenth century.With rights came responsibilities — military service was an uncontroversial, irresistible matter. On jury service, androids were a useful addition, given all the cognitive defects and weak, pliable memory of humans.Ours was the generation that came of age in the aftermath — turbulent years of passion and anguished reflection. What it meant to be human was being interestingly, or tragically, extended. If the consensus of the scientific elites was that our newly devised friends felt pain and joy and remorse, how could we prove it?EU judges will hand down crucial ruling on whether Britain...The Rolling Stones\u0027 darkest hit Sympathy for the Devil turns...Share this articleWe had been asking the same question about other humans since the dawn of philosophical reflection. Should we be troubled or delighted that they were, on the whole, cleverer, kinder, more beautiful than we were? Were the religious among us wrong to refuse to grant them souls?Then, as so often happens with contested social change, once these matters were talked out and the legislation approved, life moved on and soon no one could remember what all the fuss had been about. It’s often said that the great questions of philosophy are never resolved: they fade away.All those protest marches, monographs, speeches, conferences and dire predictions were for nothing. After all, our new friends seemed much like us, only more likeable. You could trust them, which is why so many went into law, banking and politics and began much-needed reasonable reform of those institutions. Their natures were deeply caring, and many became doctors and nurses. They were strong and fast and made up two thirds of our Olympic track and field team, though sprint hurdling took another fifteen years to perfect.Famously, they showed themselves brilliant musicians and composers in all forms of music. If ever we worried that they seemed a little too good at everything, we could congratulate ourselves that they were our creation, in our image, the final full flowering of our artistic and technical genius. They were, we often said, the better angels of our nature.By slow steps, though much remarked on, and affecting social life as well as legal process, it came to be understood and generally accepted that our crafted con-specifics deserved full dignity, and respect for their privacy. That’s to say, in a matter of years it became socially unacceptable — as was not the case in our youth — to ask.For example, at a gala dinner for a major book prize, you could not enquire of your charming neighbour at table, prompted by a rather too astute remark of his, if he, a highly respected publisher, was a bio-silicate based, locally manufactured artefact. Twenty years before, you could have — indeed, it would have been the first thing you wanted to know. It would have been no more than a casual preliminary. Just as if you had said, I hear you have a second home in Thuringia. So do I!With all the last mutinous mutterings about political correctness fading away, along with the stupid old ‘they live among us’ scare stories, it became offensive, even prurient to ask, since your enquiry would be, in essence, grossly physical, given that the matter of ascribing consciousness had long been settled. It would be no less intrusive than asking of a human over the chocolate mousse, Is it really true? Everyone’s saying you’ve had a colostomy!Another example. When Mrs Tabitha Rapting became prime minister with a parliamentary majority of two, there were those who wondered if she was ‘real’ — another hurtful word that has been dropped.But the point is this — socially, we had already crossed a great ide, for such wondering was not done in public. Only in golf club bars, or on street protest marches by marginal, radical groups. It would have been indecent, obscene, akin to racism, and therefore probably illegal. That was all long ago, and even now we’re still not sure when an android first became prime minister. Or if one ever has. Or whether we’ve lived under an unbroken succession of them.Nor do we know whether (or if) an android has ever taken the men’s or women’s singles championship at Wimbledon. Or if a human has won it these past twenty years.So if my question to Jenny that sultry July evening seems despic-able to younger readers, let me remind them that I belong to a generation that lived through the transition. As gruesome adolescents with an unforgivable taste for taunting women passers-by in shopping malls, we thought we knew a dozen ways to test the difference. We were wrong, of course — not that we would have cared.Beyond DNA analysis or deep micro-surgery, there are no means of knowing. But we knew we could always demand an answer from the victims of our taunts, and the answer was programmed always to be truthful — until that too began to change.Jenny, I’m proud to remember, did not take offence. She drew closer to me. Her eyes, now open and deep and black, were fixed on mine. She felt — words can barely perform the task — liquid, smooth, warm, enveloping. Sentient and sensual. Oh, such a loveable self. A bolt of love and pleasure threatened to render me deaf. But my curiosity was so strong that I heard every word she said. Moments like these are what we’ll take to the edge of the grave.          Ian McEwan, pictured in March this yearThe kiss we exchanged before she spoke was tender and rapturous. Her lips, her tongue — miracles, however they were formed. I knew, even before I had my answer, that I would never leave her. So why should it matter what she was made of?‘You’re mine.’ She said it as a matter of plain fact. She had uttered these words occasionally during our lovemaking and they had always pleased me. ‘And I belong to you. Everything else is froth.’ Because she paused, I disloyally wondered if these endearments, however sincere, were a form of evasion. But how dared I doubt her?‘I thought you already knew. I was formed in Dusseldorf in Greater France. So were my parents and the aunts you’re so nice to. But the cousin you met in the restaurant, the one you tried to beat at squash, he’s from Taiwan.’‘Dusseldorf!’ It was all I could manage, though the final syllable was no more than a swallowing sound, for I believed I was disappearing. Such mighty sensations belonged not to me but to the world of things, to the emptiness between things, to the essence of matter and space. Around those two entities there rose an obliterating tide of ecstasy. Such confirmation of her strange and beautiful otherness thrilled the world that included me to a vanishing point of oblivious singularity.Within seconds I had, in the colourful phrase of my shopping mall adolescence, ‘cartwheeled over the windmill’. Feebly clutching at my heart, I briefly fainted. How it shamed me to be such a selfish lover — and as I returned to the present moment I told her so. Of course, it was in her nature to forgive.I was in love and there was no turning back. But now I knew for certain something about her that I would need to bear in mind. Her processing speeds ran at half the speed of light. She could think a million times faster than me. Tact and other considerations would oblige her not to show it.But if we were to live together, I would have to acknowledge that it would be tricky for me to win an argument or counter any decision she made. In the instant it might take me to shrug and look away from her to gather my thoughts, she could have rehearsed in private reflection most of what was known about human nature and the history of civilisation.So, there it is, this is how it was for me. My generation straddled one of the great clefts or rifts in that lengthening mountain range we routinely call the story of modernity. Believe me, if you have never apologised to a machine for posing the indelicate question, then you have no concept of the historical distance that I and my generation have travelled.Ian McEwan’s new novel, Machines Like Me, will be published by Jonathan Cape on April 18, 2019. "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Charles member Royal Family visit Cuba","story":"    Prince Charles (pictured above) will become the first member of the royal family to visit CubaPrince Charles is set to become the first member of the Royal Family to visit Cuba on a historic official tour next year.The ground-breaking visit to the Communist country is still in the early stages of planning and has not been confirmed yet.But government officials from both countries are ‘extremely hopeful’ it will happen in the next few months, possibly as early as the spring, the Mail can reveal.It is understood that Charles met with the new Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, at Clarence House last month, which is being viewed by diplomats as an extremely positive sign.The trip, which will be part of a large-scale Caribbean tour, would have been unthinkable just a few years ago, as the country was emerging from six decades of leadership under the dictator Fidel Castro and his family.In 2016 Barack Obama became the first US president to visit in 88 years, but no British Prime Minister has ever set foot on Cuban soil.With the Queen no longer undertaking foreign travel, the prince’s official trips are akin to a state visit and will be viewed as a significant step forward in Britain’s relationships with the once Soviet-backed Cuba, particularly in a post-Brexit world.Revealed: Prince William invited Tony Blair to Kensington...Charles shows Theresa how it\u0027s done!

Fidel Castro (pictured above) was the longest-ruling non-royal national leader since 1900 by term length (52 years, 101 days)Charles, 70, who will be accompanied by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, 71, will have to tread carefully, however, as the unprecedented visit is likely to be viewed with caution in the US.In 2014, President Obama announced plans to normalise diplomatic relations with the country after talks with the then president, Raul Castro, Fidel’s younger brother. Relations had been severed for more than 50 years, since the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and Soviet missile crisis.He also lifted trade sanctions and made it easier for Americans to travel and do business there in the hope of improving living conditions and slowly gaining influence over the future of the Communist nation.But in June last year, President Trump overturned aspects of his predecessor’s policies, arguing leniency had achieved nothing. He cited a mysterious spate of illnesses among US diplomats in Havana and ordered most employees of his embassy to leave.He also expelled Cuban diplomats from Washington and revoked travel and business freedoms.His decisions have allowed, many officials believe, the likes of China and Russia to gain a foothold on the island just 90 miles off the US coast. The new Cuban president visited Communist-run Russia, China, North Korea, Vietnam and Laos last month.But UK diplomats hope a visit by a senior royal will help to extend Britain’s global reach in the country, particularly once Britain has left the EU. The Government will be keen to encourage a more modern, open and free Cuba, and push for greater protection for citizens in a country which has a poor human rights record, especially when it comes to arbitrary imprisonment, unfair trials, freedom of expression and the use of digital media.    The trip to Cuba (pictured above) will be part of a wider Caribbean tour Charles is likely to highlight local entrepreneurship as well as point to Britain as a potential trade and investment partner. The Cuban government is actively seeking inward foreign investment as it tries to grow its economy, which is struggling with heavy state controls and lower global commodity prices.It is anticipated that climate change and environmental issues will also feature heavily on any future royal itinerary in a region blighted by increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, such as hurricanes, and by plastics.The UK recently told the United Nations it recognises Cuba’s positive steps in combating human trafficking but remains concerned about restrictions to the freedom of expression and the treatment of prisoners, issues which Charles is expected to raise indirectly.Clarence House last night declined to comment on the prospect of a royal visit."},{"url":null,"title":"Experts lift lid numbers sweet Christmas tubs","story":"    A Nestle spokesman said the Quality Street assortment was made up of three different types of sweet – fruit cremes, chocolates, and toffees and fudge.

So if you\u0027ve seen the original movie, you\u0027ll know what comes next.For the first film, the action was set in Edwardian London in 1910. For the sequel, it takes place in the capital in 1934.Mary is called back to help her former charge Michael Banks, now a father-of-three, played by Ben Whishaw, who is despondent over the death of his wife and money problems which means he risks losing their home.Also helping to care for his children is his sister Jane, played by Emily Mortimer, who takes after her campaigning suffragette mother by becoming a union activist.When Michael dumps his old kite in the bin, it is picked up by his youngest son Georgie, who flies it the park nearby — only to bring it down to earth with Mary Poppins attached.For Mary\u0027s grand re-entrance, costume designer Sandy Powell says it was essential that the character\u0027s new reincarnation cut a recognisable silhouette.\u0027You\u0027re trying to do another version of an iconic look. And, in a way, her character can\u0027t change too much as she\u0027s always the same person like Peter Pan or James Bond.\u0027To bring her up to date, Mary\u0027s skirt has a shorter hemline, she wears a double cape made of cobalt blue and carries a carpet bag with a Thirties Art Deco design.Sandy says: \u0027Traditionally, a nanny\u0027s coat would have been navy blue, but I wanted Mary to add brightness to a dark, grey world\u0027.Despite her dainty landing, Emily Blunt admitted she was terrified while filming the arrival scene because of her fear of heights.Emily says: \u0027I was 50ft in the air and so scared. As I landed, one of the camera guys came up and said: \u0027I got really choked watching you arrive there.\u0027\u0027It reminded me people really need a film and a moment like this. Maybe we didn\u0027t realise how much we wanted Mary to come back.\u0027WHY JULIE TURNED DOWN £1 MILLION TO APPEAR          When Emily Blunt took the part, she wanted to make it her own. Rather than study the original film again she read author P.L. Travers\u0027s original eight books insteadWhen Surrey-born Emily Blunt took the part, she wanted to make it her own. Rather than studying the original film again — which she hadn\u0027t seen since she was a child — Blunt read author P.L. Travers\u0027s original eight books instead.Emily, 35, says: \u0027I decided not to be intimidated by Julie Andrews in the iconic role, and just approached it as I would any other part. No one is going to out-do Julie Andrews.\u0027Blunt found a different side to the nanny in the books, written in Thirties and Forties — \u0027a little more acerbic and vain and weird\u0027.Indeed it\u0027s a portrait the Australian-born Travers would probably have preferred, having loathed the saccharine portrayal of her creation in the first film.Emily was the only actress approached to reprise the role made famous by Sound Of Music Star Julie Andrews, now 83.And, despite a rumoured offer of over £1 million to make a cameo, Julie Andrews turned down the invitation.Director Rob Marshall says: \u0027Julie was incredibly gracious, but she made it clear right up front.\u0027She said: \u0027I really want it to be Emily\u0027s show. I really want her to take this and run with it, because she will be brilliant.\u0027 \u0027However only two members of the original onscreen Banks family survive — Glynis Johns, who is now 95, who played Mrs Banks, and Karen Dotrice, now 63, was her daughter Jane.David Tomlinson, who was strict father George Banks in the original, died in 2000 aged 83, while Matthew Garber who played his mischievous son Michael died age 21 in 1977 after catching hepatitis during a trip to India.THE MOST FAMOUS ADDRESS IN CHILDREN\u0027S BOOKS          In the original, Dick Van Dyke played doddery old banker Mr Dawes Sr, who employs Michael Banks. Now the actor reprises the role, this time as Mr Dawes\u0027s sonAmerican actor Dick Van Dyke\u0027s cockney accent as a London chimney sweep has gone down in film history for all the wrong reasons.Indeed, the actor himself has branded it the worst ever, claiming that his vocal coach was Irish and didn\u0027t know how to do one himself.          Van Dyke spent two days on set often bringing cast members like Emily Blunt to tears by singing snippets of the original songsDick, now 92, says: \u0027People in the UK love to rib me about that accent. They ask what part of England I was meant to be from and I say it was a little shire in the North where most of the people were from Ohio.\u0027In the original, Van Dyke also played doddery old banker Mr Dawes Sr, who employs Michael Banks.Now that\u0027s he\u0027s hung up his chimney brush, the actor reprises the role, this time as Mr Dawes\u0027s son, who would now be the same age — so this time

TO LAMPLIGHTER          Meryl Streep joins the new cast as cousin Topsy Tartlet. She has a fix-it shop in which everything, from grand pianos to china and statues, turns upside down on a TuesdayIn the original film, Mary\u0027s only relative was Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), who laughs so much he floats on the ceiling.For this outing, she is joined by her cousin, Topsy Tartlet, played by Meryl Streep.She has a fix-it shop in which everything, from grand pianos to china and statues, turns upside down on a Tuesday.As a result, the Oscar-winning actress performs her song Turning Turtle upside down from a chandelier.Designers say her shop was the most challenging of the 50 sets to build.Topsy\u0027s costume — inspired by Bohemian poet Edith Sitwell — was also the hardest to make and based on a pair of Twenties vintage pyjamas and a kimono.For three weeks, a team of ten textile artists bleached the material before hand-painting it with Art Deco patterns of orange, pink, turquoise and yellow.To complete the look, Streep asked for a vibrant orange wig cut into bob which was topped off with a green turban and curtain tassles for earrings.THE BATH THAT BECOMES AN UNDERWATER ADVENTURE          Mary and the Banks children Georgie (Joel Dawson), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) go on a series of adventures in the filmJust as they did in the first film, Mary and the Banks children Georgie (Joel Dawson), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) — embark on a series of Technicolor-style fantasy adventures.One of the most beloved in the first film was when the characters jumped into Bert\u0027s chalk pavement pictures to discover a magical world where they interact with cartoon characters.And rather than use computer-generated images, the makers returned to traditional hand-drawn animation, a technique not employed in a Disney movie for nearly ten years.However in other parts of the film, computer animation is used when a dolphin beckons the children into the bath tub — and leads them to an underwater fantasia.The mix of special effects and live action meant that, although the live filming only took four months, Mary Poppins Returns spent more than a year in post-production, as long as a science fiction movie.RETURN TO A VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL          In one scene in which the children break a Royal Doulton bowl, Mary decides the only way to fix it is to disappear inside itWhen the children break a Royal Doulton bowl, Mary decides the only way to fix it is to disappear inside it.She spins the bowl around, creating a whirlwind that transports them within.Once there, Mary Poppins picks up her umbrella, and turns it to create a tent which turns into a Victorian music hall where Jack and Mary put on a show — with dozens of dressed-up cartoon animals in the audience.Hollywood film star and cricket hero are named among 35...Share this articleTo help the character fit with the animated creations, costume designer Sandy Powell says they wanted to make the humans\u0027 clothing look two-dimensional, as if had also been drawn by the animators.The outfits were then made out of canvas-like material which was hand-painted with details like collars, buttons and bows.Sandy Powell says: \u0027I wanted the effect on all of these costumes to look like watercolour on paper with the white coming through.\u0027THE RETURN OF THE PENGUINS          In the new movie the dapper bow-tied  penguins return once more. At the time of the original movie it was a pioneering move to combine live action and animationThe scene where Dick Van Dyke as Bert performs a tap dance with a group of four bow-tied penguin waiters was one of the most beloved from the original movie.At the time it was a pioneering move to combine live action and animation — shot against a bright yellow, rather than green, screen — which was so hard on the eyes that the actor reported he couldn\u0027t see by the end of the day.Now the dapper penguins have returned once more — named after Hollywood legends, (Fred) Astaire, (Oliver) Hardy, (Cary) Grant and (Charlie) Chaplin — to perform a music hall number with Mary and Jack.As well as some of the favourites from the original movie, the film also features nine new songs written by the same team who wrote the musical Hairspray, but which are intended to sound as if they could have been written in 1964.Although she has to match the legendary singing voice of Julie Andrews, Emily Blunt also has no problem holding a musical note.Before she became an actress, she was considering career as singer until she was spotted in a school production performing at the Edinburgh Festival.A LOVE LETTER TO LONDON          The film include\u0027s so many of London\u0027s landmarks- from areas outside the Bank of England and also Buckingham PalaceThe film has been called a \u0027love letter to London\u0027, because it includes so many of the city\u0027s landmarks.Areas outside the Bank of England and also Buckingham Palace were taken over during night shoots by hundreds of extras on vintage bikes and buses borrowed from the London Transport Museum.To add to the atmosphere, mist was used to look like a pre-war fog.However, actor Lin-Manuel Miranda said using the iconic locations piled on the pressure to get the scenes right first time: \u0027The adrenaline was pumping.

But being prepared didn’t make it any less daunting.The difference in physical stature between the two — Samantha is a diminutive 5ft 4in, Kelvin around 6ft tall — was matched by the stark contrast in their circumstances.At 25, Samantha was a lowly sales assistant Kelvin was 62, worth £500 million and the much-revered chief executive of fashion empire Ted Baker. Little wonder she felt nervous. ‘As I started to pull away, he continued to hug me. I stayed there for five seconds and then thought: “This is too long,” ’ Samantha recalls.‘As I pulled back, he kissed me on my shoulder. I was wearing a sleeveless dress. We’d only just met. I was shocked and disgusted.’Samantha is one of around 100 current or former employees who’ve reported receiving unwanted advances from Kelvin while working at the multi-national clothes company he founded 30 years ago.They accuse him of harassing them with uninvited hugs and crude sexual innuendo.  CEO of Ted Baker, Ray Kelvin (left and right) has worked in the fashion industry for more than 40 years and is now facing a string of bullying and harassment allegationsIt has been claimed Kelvin forced workers to sit on his lap and massaged their ears that he discussed his sex life in their presence, asked employees about their own relationships and took his shirt off in front of staff.The allegations emerged at the start of this week after staff used employee website Organise to launch a petition for an independent body to investigate their complaints.Ted Baker founder Ray Kelvin takes temporary leave as chief...Bizarre moment Ted Baker boss, 62, embroiled in \u0027forced...Share this articleAs days passed and some 1,000 Ted Baker staff backed the petition, the claims grew more torrid.It was said Kelvin reportedly pinned a male employee against an office wall when it transpired Kelvin was not invited to his wedding, before the company reportedly paid the man and his fiancee to leave without making a fuss.Yesterday, a second senior executive was accused of unwelcome hugging and the company — which had defended its hugs as an innocuous ‘part of Ted Baker’s culture’ — announced that Kelvin was to take a voluntary leave of absence while law firm Herbert Smith Freehills carries out an ‘independent external investigation’, with immediate effect.In a statement Kelvin said ‘the accusations of the past week have raised some very serious and upsetting issues’ and it was ‘only right the board should investigate fully’.          Kelvin (pictured) is to take a voluntary leave of absence while law firm Herbert Smith Freehills carries out an ‘independent external investigation’, with immediate effectTed Baker — whose distinctive clothes have been worn by celebrities including the Duchess of Cambridge, Amal Clooney and Holly Willoughby — has seen shares plummet to a five-year low. In a statement yesterday, Kelvin said: ‘Ted Baker has been my life and soul for 30 years. I love this company and care deeply for all my colleagues.’Ironically, Kelvin, a twice-married and fiercely private father of three, has long claimed to be staunchly protective of his workers’ rights, and a man to whom the bullying renowned among many of his peers in the fashion industry is anathema.Positing himself as the polar opposite of audacious Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green, himself struggling to recover from allegations of misogyny and abuse, Kelvin shuns the limelight, saying flaunting wealth is ‘vulgar’ and ‘the world has made too much of business people becoming celebrities’.Indeed, his profile is so low that until this week, few outside the fashion industry would have heard of him.Instead of advocating a rigid hierarchy, his managerial approach seems to render professional boundaries all but obsolete.His 80,000 sq ft North London HQ, a former Post Office sorting office known as the ‘Ugly Brown Building’, where Ted Baker has been based since 2000, has hosted stress massages for employees.A sign next to Kelvin’s desk in his open plan office says ‘Hugs Here’.‘I make it my business to get to know everyone. I give them all nicknames so I remember people’s names,’ Kelvin told Vogue in 2013. ‘I want to give them a real career — a “teducation” as we call it. It’s all just one big hug.’    This is the bizarre moment Ray Kelvin, 63, embroiled in \u0027forced hugging\u0027 staff harassment scandal kisses a footballer But in the post #MeToo era, with corporate culture under ever more piercing a spotlight, this quirky approach suddenly seems rife for abuse. His attempts to appear a friendly hero are now viewed by many as a cynical ploy to exploit employees’ vulnerability.Speaking to both his allies and critics this week, the Mail discovered a complex character, whose actions appear driven as much by insecurity as arrogance and desire.The son of a factory worker, Kelvin, who has two adult sons from his first marriage and a five-year-old daughter with current wife Clare, 46, was brought up in North London, where his parents taught him ‘you had to work hard for anything you wanted’.From the day he opened his first Ted Baker store in Glasgow in 1988, selling fashionably garish men’s shirts, the moniker Ted Baker provided a fictional frontman for Kelvin to hide behind. ‘I didn’t want to use my real name,’ he said. ‘I thought I’d be a failure. I could have gone bankrupt, then my name would have always been associated with a failed company.’Ted was the suave alter ego the self-effacing Kelvin wished he could be. In contrast, Kelvin was ‘camera-shy’ and described himself as ‘ugly’ — a reason given for his bizarre habit of partially obscuring his face behind inanimate objects such as sofas, towels and books on the rare occasions he agreed to be photographed.Despite — or, indeed, because of — his unconventional approach to business, his company grew, expanding into womenswear, shoes and accessories. And when, in 1997 Ted Baker — by then worth £56 million — went public, Kelvin’s demeanour dramatically changed.Having described himself as an aggressive ‘monster’ in the early years, success brought a management style as irreverent as his £279 sparkly jumpsuits.          More than 100 staff have submitted anonymous stories of harassment on Organise, the campaign website where the petition beganTearfully, one employee stressed Kelvin’s loyalty to his workers: ‘One woman has worked here since she was 16 and is now a director. The cleaner has been here for 30 years. Every year, without fail, she wins Employee of the Year.‘One man had cancer and Ray helped with his treatment and held him in his hospital bed. Ray is the most honourable man.’These sentiments were echoed by Kelvin’s first wife, Georgia Slowe, 53, who lives five minutes away from him. A former actress in Emmerdale, she married Kelvin in 1993 and remained friends after orcing him in 2000.‘I think what’s happening is ridiculous,’ she says. Describing Kelvin as the ‘loveliest man’ she adds: ‘I think it’s wonderful to have a family-like atmosphere at work. He’s a brilliant businessman.’Perhaps so, but Kelvin — awarded a CBE for his work in fashion in 2011 — is inappropriately puerile and his humour peppered with sexual overtones. For example, he insists that even those employees in a relationship when they joined Ted Baker must have an ‘office boyfriend’ or ‘office girlfriend’.While he clearly enjoys flirting, he doesn’t limit his attention to one woman — or man. ‘He is effectively having an affair with everybody, every day,’ says one acquaintance. ‘He’s just as touchy-feely with men. He is childlike and craves attention and approval.‘I think he’s charmingly weird rather than sinister and creepy. But as Ray has got older, he has become slightly more eccentric and lost sight of the effect his actions have on others. He forgets he is old enough to be his employees’ father.’Both Samantha and Lucy tell me the senior cohort of employees surrounding Kelvin seemed happy enough hugging their boss.‘It was well known that those in the higher levels were totally fine with it,’ says Lucy, adding: ‘I don’t know if they went along with it because they were being paid a lot of money and hugging was a part and parcel of being there.’It seems to have been primarily Kelvin’s younger employees, better versed in political correctness and workplace rights than older generations, who objected enough to instigate the recent petition. ‘I can’t recall any sales associates — who were aged between 19 and 27 — who wanted to hug him,’ says Samantha. She was warned by colleagues when she started as a sales assistant this year that, should she meet Kelvin, he would hug her for ‘way too long’.She adds: ‘I was nervous, but the managers made it seem there was no choice that it was a big deal to meet the CEO of your company. I didn’t want to get into trouble.’Before her own encounter, she had already seen Kelvin kiss a male colleague on the forehead. ‘He told me afterwards he’d never felt so violated. I told him to go to human resources, but he said nothing would be done — that’s just Kelvin’s way of saying hello.’          Staff at the high street giants also accused Kelvin of making them sit on his knee and taking his shirt offWhen it happened to Samantha weeks later (with a kiss on the shoulder) she, too, kept quiet. ‘I didn’t think HR would listen,’ she says. ‘I felt disappointed and embarrassed and didn’t tell anyone.’ Instead, she made sure she was out of Kelvin’s vicinity next time he visited the store, and left his company shortly afterwards.Rumours of unhappiness have swirled around for some time, but have, until now, been contained.When Rebecca Waller-Davies, a journalist from trade publication Retail Week, suggested to Kelvin that women had been coerced into sitting on his knee this summer, he told her she was on ‘very dangerous ground’ before pulling her to a hug, kissing her cheek and claiming, ‘I am not apologising for this’ — words that, tellingly, remained unpublished until this week.As even a close acquaintance concedes: ‘I can imagine him saying that. He’s very sensitive to criticism and I know this episode will have hurt him.’Whether through loyalty or fear, no staff at any of the three Ted Baker stores the Mail visited this week would comment on their boss’s situation. When the Mail visited the London HQ to ask to speak to Kelvin, three members of staff emerged to tell our reporter he was not available.After repeated attempts to contact Kelvin for comment, a statement from Ted Baker said the company would ‘carefully consider the content and recommendations’ of the independent report.‘We have always placed great importance on our culture. It is critically important to us that every member of our staff feels valued and respected at work. We do not believe these reports are reflective of the organisation we have all worked hard to develop over the last 30 years.’Kelvin, for his part, said in a statement yesterday: ‘Ted Baker means everything to me and I can’t bear to see it harmed in any way.’Whether he can weather this storm — and whether he deserves to — is a matter of opinion.Additional reporting: STEPHANIE CONDRON"},{"url":null,"title":"Liverpool council finds 24 asylum seekers posing children","story":"    Storm: Siavash Shah claimed to be 15.

I think that is the best compromise,\u0027 she said.\u0027What I\u0027ve done is look ahead and seen that after that, if it doesn\u0027t get through, anything could happen, there could be all sorts of alternatives that could be thrown up, which is one of the reasons we need to back the prime minister in the vote on Tuesday.\u0027The former Home Secretary added: \u0027It\u0027s remarkable, I think, that she\u0027s managed to deliver on a plan which delivers on the outcome of the referendum, that gives us the best in terms of keeping close to the economy and addresses people\u0027s concerns, for instance, on fishery and immigration.      Julian Smith (pictured above) is set to present the Prime Minister with his final count of the number of Tory MPs on whose support she can relyThe paper reported Cabinet ministers have also warned Mrs May she would have to stand down if the deal is defeated and she fails to secure better terms from the European Union. Last night Amber Rudd became the first Cabinet minister to openly discuss an alternative plan to Mrs May\u0027s deal. The Work and Pensions Secretary told The Times a Norway-style arrangement \u0027seems plausible not just in terms of the country but in terms of where the MPs are\u0027. A Norway option would keep Britain tied to most EU laws and rules, including free movement and vast annual contributions.As many as ten senior ministers have privately discussed backing the option. However, one minister described it as \u0027absolutely horrendous\u0027, adding: \u0027It would split the party for a generation.\u0027It would also be the biggest betrayal of the British people. We\u0027re in real danger now.\u0027There were also signs last night that Labour is seeking to join forces with rebel Tories and the DUP to force Mrs May\u0027s resignation in a no-confidence vote if her Brexit plan is heavily defeated.In public, Downing Street continued to insist yesterday that the vote on the withdrawal agreement would go ahead as planned.          Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom (pictured above) is also understood to be open to the idea of pulling the vote if there is a clear plan about what to do nextBut privately aides acknowledged the Prime Minister would \u0027take stock\u0027 over the weekend at her country retreat of Chequers before reaching a decision.A final media blitz is planned for the next 48 hours as Tory whips canvass MPs on their intentions. Mrs May will then sit down with her inner circle on Monday to make the call. At the meeting, Chief Whip Julian Smith will present her with his final count of the number of Tory MPs on whose support she can rely. In recent weeks more than 100 Tory MPs have signalled their opposition.One Whitehall source said trying to convince rebels to fall in line was like \u0027shouting out of a window\u0027. Last night, one Cabinet source said: \u0027If we\u0027re heading for three figures defeat then why go ahead with it?\u0027An amendment designed to limit the UK\u0027s stay in the Northern Ireland backstop appeared dead on arrival after it was blasted by the Democratic Unionist Party – which props up the Tories in the Commons – and Eurosceptics.A poll also revealed that despite the chaos in Westminster, the parties are running neck and neck among the public. Both Labour and the Conservatives are on 38 per cent, according to the survey by Ipsos Mori.    Liz Truss (pictured above) tries her hand at making black puddings After posing with a black pudding, she claimed Theresa May\u0027s EU withdrawal agreement would give British foodmakers the chance to sell more overseas. \u0027There\u0027s a lot of demand for fantastic British products,\u0027 said the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on a visit to the Fruit Pig Company in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire.                                                    But others say any attempt to reopen the deal would be a \u0027world of pain\u0027 and immediately prompt Spain, France and other countries to demand concessions on issues such as Gibraltar and fishing. Last night one senior Tory warned Eurosceptics that not voting for the deal would \u0027almost certainly\u0027 mean leaving on softer terms. \u0027Eventually you have to stare down the barrel,\u0027 said the source. \u0027There is no Parliamentary manoeuvre which hardens the options that we have now. They are going to have to choose.\u0027Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom is also understood to be open to the idea of pulling the vote if there is a clear plan about what to do next. Hardline Eurosceptics argue a huge defeat would send a signal to the EU that they would need to compromise.The amendment, proposed by Tory loyalists, would give MPs a vote in 2020 over whether to enter the backstop or extend the transition period – and place a \u0027duty\u0027 on the government to have a workable alternative within a year. But backbench Tory Peter Bone told the BBC the amendment was \u0027absolutely meaningless\u0027. He said: \u0027It\u0027s got no binding force.\u0027DUP Leader Arlene Foster said: \u0027Domestic legislative tinkering won\u0027t cut it.\u0027 Last night US vice president Mike Pence spoke of a \u0027strong partnership\u0027 after discussions about Brexit with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.It appeared to boost the chance of a UK-US deal after Donald Trump last week indicated the EU deal would make it hard to achieve. Amber Rudd on Brexit: ‘My mind hasn’t changed — if there’s a new referendum, we’re better off in’ | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/07/16/035CAD55000003E8-0-image-a-46_1544199417937.jpg","title":"Amber Rudd says Norway Plus option plausible alternative Theresa Mays Brexit deal","story":"    The UK could pursue alternative options including a \u0027Norway Plus\u0027 option should Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan be rejected by MPs, Amber Rudd has acknowledged.

She said should the deal be voted down, she would prefer a so-called Norway-plus model for Brexit that would involve staying part of the European Economic Area. Under the Norway-plus plan, the UK would remain in the single market and customs union, which would remove the need to use the Irish backstop provision\u0027A lot of people have a perfect vision of what they think Brexit should look like, and that \u0027perfect\u0027 is not available,\u0027 she told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today.\u0027What we need is a compromise deal, that\u0027s what the Prime Minister has proposed and I would urge my colleagues to think about, first of all, why people voted to leave the European Union, what their interpretation is of that and secondly, what the alternatives are.\u0027This is why I think it is important for people not just to think why they don\u0027t particularly like the Withdrawal Agreement but what they would like better that is available and would get through the House of Commons.\u0027           Amber Rudd (pictured) has said a Norway-style arrangement \u0027seems plausible not just in terms of the country but in terms of where the MPs are\u0027Senior Norwegian politicians have warned Britain cannot have the same deal enjoyed by their country even if Theresa May\u0027s deal is defeated. It was claimed today that at least 10 Cabinet ministers could back the Norway-style Brexit to break the impasse. Under the Norway-plus plan, the UK would remain in the single market and customs union, which would remove the need to use the Irish backstop provision.It would also protect current trade links with the EU - but it would fail to deliver on key Brexiteer promises over free movement and sovereignty. Mrs May was warned by critics that she could be forced to stand down as Prime Minister if her Brexit deal is defeated in the Commons next week.           Norwegian MP Heidi Nordby Lunde (file) Britain cannot have the same deal enjoyed by her country even if Theresa May\u0027s deal is defeatedEurosceptic former party leader Iain Duncan Smith cautioned against the PM and her Cabinet deciding to \u0027brazen it out\u0027, saying such an approach would be a \u0027disaster\u0027.\u0027How the PM responds after the vote matters more than anything else she has done,\u0027 he told the Daily Telegraph.\u0027I believe that if the response is, \u0027we\u0027ve lost but we will do this all over again\u0027, it will become a leadership issue.\u0027Another former leader Lord Howard said Mrs May would have \u0027difficult decisions to make about her future and about the future of our country\u0027 if she loses on December 11.Ms Rudd said she hoped the Government would \u0027regroup\u0027 and \u0027hold stable, hold firm\u0027 in the aftermath of a defeat.          Despite the warning Labour MP Stephen Kinnock (file)  said the warring Brexit tribes needed to put aside their differences\u0027What would be a complete mistake would be to allow what is already an unstable period to descend into further instability with talk of a leadership change,\u0027 she said.The Cabinet minister also appeared to endorse an amendment to the Government\u0027s motion for the vote on Tuesday tabled by former Northern Ireland minister Sir Hugo Swire in an attempt to win over wavering Eurosceptics.The alteration would mean Parliament would have to approve a decision to trigger the backstop arrangement, put a one-year time limit on it and seek assurances from the EU that the backstop would be temporary.Ms Rudd told Today: \u0027Hugo Swire has put an amendment down which I hope will give some of my colleagues reassurance over the so-called backstop.\u0027Lord Howard suggested that talks with Brussels should be intensified to prepare for a Brexit with no formal deal.\u0027We should seek to put in place some ad hoc, temporary arrangements with the agreement of the European Union which would minimise and, indeed, perhaps even eliminate any disruption at the border on March 30 next year,\u0027 he told Today.\u0027We should also undertake that we would unilaterally, for the period of 12 months after March 29, allow any goods and services in from the European Union without any tariffs or tariff barriers or obstacles in any way - hope that they will reciprocate but do it even if they don\u0027t - and use that 12-month period to negotiate a free-trade agreement along the style of Canada-plus.\u0027 Norwegian MP Heidi Nordby Lunde told The Guardian it was \u0027not an option\u0027.She said: \u0027Really, the Norwegian option is not an option.\u0027We have been telling you this for one and a half years since the referendum and how this works, so I am surprised that after all these years it is still part of the grown-up debate in the UK.\u0027You just expect us to give you an invitation rather than consider whether Norway would want to give you such an invitation.\u0027It might be in your interest to use our agreement, but it would not be in our interest.\u0027Despite the warning Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said the warring Brexit tribes needed to put aside their differences.

That commonality of experience is at the heart of what I do as an artist.”Now 47, Starkey has been making images of ordinary women for more than 20 years, her complex, cleverly choreographed portraits blurring the lines between portraiture, documentary and staging. A new book, Photographs 1997-2017, is a selective survey of an artistic career that started in spectacular fashion when her MA show in 1998 caused quite a stir in the London art world and has since settled into a quiet, consistently attentive exploration of female experience that also implicitly questions how women are represented elsewhere in our profligate image culture.Though her photographs appear at first glance to be traditional observational documentary, they are deftly choreographed. Often she reimagines what she has observed on the street or in cafes, clubs and bars, using women she has hired to meticulously create stilled moments of female reverie, togetherness or fleeting interaction. The results are both truthful and artfully constructed, capturing the small gestures and glances of everyday experience while also subverting traditional notions of documentary and street photography.“In the beginning, I wanted to create a hybrid out of the different approaches I had been taught,” she says, “by somehow bringing together the emotive language of documentary with the slickness of advertising and the observational style of street photography. I think I’ve become more reflective and considered, but the performative element has been a constant.”Having “wandered into” photography via a vocational course at Napier University in Edinburgh, Belfast-born Starkey went on to study for an MA at the Royal College of Art. There she found her subject and her hybrid style, influenced, she says, by Peter Galassi’s book, Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort, which laid bare the anxieties at the heart of the American ideal of home through images by the likes of Nan Goldin, William Eggleston and Cindy Sherman. Her MA show featured seven large-format photographs of young women interacting, their style and compositional skill self-consciously referencing both classical painting and elaborate film stills. It caught the attention of London gallerist Maureen Paley, who left a note for her at the college and has represented her ever since.“That graduate show set me up,” says Starkey. “Suddenly I was in demand and simultaneously I became very aware of the different space that women occupy in the photography world, both as practitioners and subjects. I have been acutely aware of that ever since, the ways in which women are constantly evaluated and judged. My gaze is not directed in that way. A lot of what I do is about creating a different level of engagement with women, a different space for them without that judgment or scrutiny.”With two teenage daughters of her own, she is concerned about the tyranny of selfie culture and the ways in which young women are “being targeted much earlier as consumers and told constantly that their value is in their looks”. At the same time she is inspired by how younger female photographers are making their presence felt. “It just feels like things are opening up because so many young women are expressing themselves through photography.”Though Starkey has always been an implicitly political artist, the concluding series in the book – images of protesters at the Women’s March in London, 2017 – is the closest she has come to more overtly activist photography. Here, too, the images have been created using technological post-production, allowing her to distil the experience of the protest into more formally constructed photographs. She is, she acknowledges in the afterword to the book, “interested in the psychological truth more than the photographic truth.” That, perhaps, is the essence of her hybrid way of seeing.Photographs 1997–2017 by Hannah Starkey is out now (Mack, £40).

Or rather two problems. The first is a matter of definition: who or what is a human being, entitled to the rights spelled out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? The second is the old mind-body split: what if these two components have different wills?I illustrate by means of the Ohio Republicans, who have recently moved to declare motherhood mandatory, and also to define any fertilised egg – whether in a woman’s body or in a Petri dish – a person under the law. Causing a non-living condition in such an entity would be murder, incurring the death penalty. Even if by miscarriage, it could be manslaughter: a woman might spend years in prison for falling off a horse, like Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind. (These same Republicans have plans to declare an acorn an oak tree: anyone destroying an acorn would incur the full wrath of the environmental tree-protection forces.)But the Libertarians too must be satisfied: the rights of the inidual must be respected! This could be solved by reverting to the 19th century and declaring women to be adults in respect to responsibilities, but children in respect to rights. Though that might not wash today, considering all the new rights children have been granted.However, a more sophisticated plan is being mulled over, helped by another Republican who declared that pregnant women cannot have been raped, since a woman’s body “shut(s) that whole thing down”. According to this theory, the body is a sort of automaton.Thus one proposal might be to declare women persons from the neck up, but things from the neck down. The things could then be requisitioned by the state, like parcels of land. In fairness, compensation would have to be paid to the head, at full market value. The head would be, legally, a she the body would be an it.This will annoy some of the female heads, and squawking will ensue but anti-squawking legislation should take care of that! (Not applicable to chickens.)However, with advances in transplant surgery a solution satisfactory to all could be legislated: a mandatory Head Exchange! Those heads that don’t want their bodies to have children would be made to switch with those heads who’d like to have children, but whose bodies refuse to comply. Joy all round! (These lawmakers would surely pass a sub-clause changing the words of “I’m So Pretty”, from West Side Story, to “I’m So Itty”. This would reinforce the message to women that their bodies are things, and have no human rights.)People, I don’t recommend any of this. It would go pear-shaped very fast (no innuendo intended). Instead of happiness there would be strife. Imagine the arguments that would take place over the allocations of heads and bodies! Bribery and political influence would play their part – and picture the lawsuits concerning bodies that malfunction. Some heads – I hesitate to say – might declare a wish to get pregnant simply in order to obtain a body more to their liking. What uproar!To forestall this sad state of affairs, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should add a clause concerning the Right to Refuse Ittiness. In view of the new findings that the intestinal tract constitutes a second brain, this clause would reject the mind-body split and declare the neck a protected area, much like the Korean demilitarised zone. Problem solved!Not that such a clause will do much good in Ohio, where they don’t seem so keen on the universal declaration in any case.It makes sense that the original Declaration of Human Rights ignores the Earth – the Earth was the backdrop to the human story. Against that backdrop, for thousands of years, the great dramas had been carried out: tyrannies risen and fallen, wars won and lost, ordinary people oppressed and rebelling. The idea of the “environment” would barely have made sense at the time – obviously the physical systems of the planet were necessary to grow crops, obviously the Earth’s resources could be hoarded or shared. But it was the scenery, not the play. As we got better at storing food and fighting germs, and as world wars terrified us with their uncontrollable violence, the physical world seemed to be receding ever further. We needed instead to focus on what humans could do to each other, for better and for worse.And now that has shifted, decisively. Though all the concerns of the universal declaration – intolerance, poverty, ill health, the lack of education, suffrage, work – remain as acute as ever, they have been joined by an overriding if often unspoken dread. We have begun (slowly, perhaps too late) to understand what we can do to the Earth, and what in turn that damaged Earth can do to us.It was a recognition that began to dawn in the years just after 1948 – by the early 1960s Rachel Carson had begun the vital task (in Silent Spring) of knocking the shine off “progress”. It’s given rise to one of the greatest movements the world has ever seen, this thing awkwardly called “environmentalism” that has united people across continents and faiths and races. But it still exerts a tenuous claim on power: no one “denies” war or hunger or unemployment, but many of the world’s paramount leaders continue to pretend we cannot damage the planet.That pretence, of course, is rooted in the wealth and power of precisely those humans who do the most damage. The oil industry, for instance, long the richest single force on this globe, and one that has spent a generation insisting that climate change isn’t real, even as the Arctic melted and the sea began to rise. Or agribusiness, or the chemical industry, or many others – all of whom insist that they are merely meeting the human needs enshrined in the declaration, for housing and energy and dinner.And so it is necessary to postulate a new right: that humans must be protected against those forces that would damage the Earth’s systems. Indeed, none of the other rights can be guaranteed on an unstable planet: a heating planet endangers everything from food supplies to political freedom. In some sense, securing the physical Earth is the first order of business now, not an add-on.But it is a complicated right, one that comes with a corresponding responsibility not to do that damage ourselves. Or not any more than we absolutely must. And it is complicated further by the fact that we must think not only about the humans of the moment, but the humans of the future as well: the Peloponnesian war is not still claiming human lives because it ended 2,500 years ago, but our current destruction of the climate will be impoverishing people for 10 times that long.This “right” is not an aspiration but a requirement. If we mistreat each other for another 70 years that will be hideous, but humans of 2088 will still be able to change. If we mistreat the Earth for another seven decades, implacable physics and chemistry and biology will write the next chapter in our history.The right to live free from blame for the fact that someone or something has made a man feel small or unimportant, for example if they are not King of the Entire World, if they have not won the medal, or made the money, if they have not beaten the opposition in the last 24 hours, even if the opposition is in their own head. The right to live radiantly free of a man’s feelings about all this, even if you are the person who makes their dinner, or the person who does not make their dinner but probably should because they really need something from you, they are feeling so undervalued, and maybe sex will do.The right to freedom from blame if you are a woman who sleeps with a man or does not sleep with a man, who flatters or fails to flatter a man who is feeling the grip of shame or mortality because he is not the poshest, or the strongest, or the most eloquent, or in some way the most important person in the world, or at least in the room.The right not to get hit for all the above.The right not to get raped ditto.The right not to make anyone’s dinner but your own.The right not to be compared with a man’s mother, if she was lovely, or confused with a man’s mother if she was not – this especially if she made him feel small or unimportant or mortal at the age when every child deserves to feel like the King of the Entire World. We are sorry you missed all this, or that this phase ended abruptly or badly for you, it is not our fault. We were not there. Yes we have breasts and no, despite the fact that these are actual breasts and therefore very confusing for you, we were not there.The right to bodily autonomy, of course.The right to live free from a man’s need to use you as a way to bond with other men, by turning you into an object of shame or derision.The right to call out the difference between wanting and possessing, between liking and taking, looking and touching. The right to your own ideas, even if a man at the meeting likes them and therefore thinks that they are his. The right to your own body, even if a man at a meeting likes it and therefore thinks it is his. The right to both these things even if everyone else at the meeting agrees with him for reasons that are completely hidden from their conscious minds and also inexplicable and strange.The right to call it out when a man takes something and holds you responsible for the theft – of your work, your talent, your body, your sweetness or sexuality, your good thing. The right to tell this to the world without being accused of masochism or greed or of wearing the wrong underwear, of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or of wanting a job, of wanting to be hurt, of wanting it, whatever it is, sex, or power, or humiliation, because when a woman wants a little she gets everything and then some. She gets the blame. The right to hand back the blame.The right to love a good man, and to love the goodness in men, when they are authoritative and gentle and know who they are.The right to desire, because your mind is always free.We live in strange times, and we’re actively making them stranger. Volkswagen has been forced to pay out more than €28bn for designing cars that could cheat emissions tests. Political operatives use the unstated fashion choices of voters to microselect for campaign ads. YouTube’s recommendation algorithms are implicated in the radicalisation of flat earthers and ultranationalists. Artificially intelligent machines beat us at games with novel strategies we do not, and cannot, understand. The future is only going to be more confusing. Six years before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed, the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov proposed his famous Three Laws of Robotics: that a robot must not harm or, through inaction, allow harm to come to any human being that it must obey orders given to it by human beings where they do not contradict the first law and that it must protect its own existence to the extent that doing so would not conflict with the first two laws. They’re good laws, but the robots that Asimov imagined were discrete beings, aloof and accountable – and very different from the entangled, ever-present, overwhelmingly sophisticated yet often obscure technologies we actually find ourselves living among today.Instead of visibly dangerous robots, we have hidden programs inside car engines that poison the atmosphere, prejudiced automation systems for sentencing and job selection, covert data-gathering regimes that sell us out to corporations and political enemies, and proprietary attention-seeking algorithms which distract our attention, and amplify ision and conspiracy. If it were robots that were doing all that, a contemporary update to Asimov’s laws might require them to explain themselves to humans, so that we might not be harmed by the fact that most of the time, we have no idea what they’re doing. But really, the onus is on us, not on them.What then would this requirement look like if framed as a right? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was primarily concerned with interpersonal relationships and mutual understanding it speaks of “a common understanding of these rights and freedoms” as well as the promotion of “understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups”. But when so many of those relationships are mediated by inscrutable technologies, the understanding required is that of systems, not of one another.Today we hear a lot about the benefits new technologies such as artificial intelligence and mass automation will bring to our lives, but even those tasked with constructing them have little understanding of the effects they will have on our societies. Lack of understanding – the feeling of being lost and powerless in the world – leads to fear, apathy and rage. It’s hardly surprising then that in these times of technological acceleration and complexity, those are the dominant emotions felt across the globe.The right to understand, then, would be a useful addition to what is expected for us today. A demand both for better education – not just in technology, but in all forms of critical thinking – allied with the requirement that those deploying complex and life-affecting technologies must consult with those subject to them, engineer them for transparency, and actively work to make them comprehensible and accountable. Only through mass understanding, and thus mass engagement and mass participation, might we hope to get a firmer grip on an increasingly strange and inscrutable world.Everyone has the right to fulfil their potential, free from discrimination.It’s time to recognise drastic racial disparities in our institutions for what they are – a threat to human potential. Discrimination places an insidious stranglehold on what a person can be, and how far they can go. It limits inidual lives, marginalises talent, and hinders society.No child should ever have to be warned that in the worlds of school and employment, they’ll have to work twice as hard for half the reward. That this lesson must be instilled in a child of colour before they strike out on their own is an indication that we still live with drastic inequality.That same child should never have to look at leadership and decide that it isn’t for them, because leaders don’t look like them, or come from where they come from.Not everyone aspires to achieve great things. Each of our understandings of “great” is different. A fair society doesn’t demand that you should be a leader, but it certainly doesn’t try to hold you back if you want to be. It won’t tell you that you’re too poor, or too female, or too black to be where you want to be, or do what you’d like to do.Outside of aspiration, every person deserves fair treatment inside each institution that we have to interact with to survive – employment, education, housing and healthcare. You deserve to live your life without being blown off course by the distraction of racism.No burden should be placed on the shoulders of marginalised people to live a double consciousness, in which we know the reality of discrimination, but never speak of it in order to keep the peace. Your safety and stability should never be reliant on an expectation that you’ll be silent about subtle injustice.You should never have to make the case to be seen as a full human being. Immigrants and refugees should have the freedom to live a banal and mediocre life in their country of asylum without the threat of being sent back to danger. You shouldn’t have to climb up the side of a building and rescue a toddler to be granted citizenship, because being exceptional is not a passport to being an agreeable refugee.If you’re a British citizen who is not white, your “not whiteness” should never be provided as an explanation as to why you did a bad thing. The fact that you are not white does not indicate a tendency to doing bad things. Black is not shorthand for bad.You deserve to live in a society where the life-limiting aspects of discrimination are eliminated. Where your race, gender or class has a nominal effect on your life’s trajectory. Where no one is held back by structural bias.Thanks to article 23 of the declaration, we can all claim the right to work. Article 23 also gives us the right to do the work we choose under decent conditions, protected from all the adverse consequences of losing both wages and a sense of human purpose. Oh, and a just living wage, social insurance and the inidual and collective safeguarding of workers’ interests.These precious provisions around the right to work are followed immediately by a recognition of the right to limits on work, or in the words of article 24, “the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay”.The adjacency of the articles implies their inextricability the right to work is meaningless in the absence of a right to a life beyond work. Yet survey the landscape of work today, and we find the latter everywhere under assault. For the sweatshop workers of China and Bangladesh, the precarious workforce of our expanding gig economy, even for the chronically enervated workaholic bankers and lawyers of Wall Street and the City, the right to a non-working life has been annulled by the sovereignty of work.How have we allowed the right to non-work to be so thoroughly undermined? The first point to make is that this is as a predicament of psychology and culture as much as politics and economics. It is rooted in a deeply entrenched conception of the human being as a creature whose substance and meaning lie in work above all. The declaration, in defining the right to non-work in terms of “rest and leisure”, implies that its purpose is to serve the imperatives of work we rest in order to restore ourselves for work leisure is the term used for play outside working hours.While the declaration, in other words, clearly recognises the essential place of work in human self-definition, it recognises non-work only in the negative – as an interval in or limit on the state of work. What if non-work could gain a new, positive and substantive place in the declaration? If we human beings could be established by it as creatures who paint, sing, speculate idly or stare out of the window not because it restores our working batteries, but because the state of idleness is its own value?The British psychoanalyst DW Winnicott saw us as composed of two fundamental elements: “doing” and “being”. His point was that as we grow more distant from the daily reveries of infancy and childhood, we define ourselves increasingly in terms of doing at the expense of being. But neglecting the dimension of being, he argued, can make us psychically and physically ill. “After being,” he writes in a typically terse formulation, “doing … but first, being.”Could the declaration find a place among the fundamental human rights for the right to be? This is to be distinguished from the right to life, which secures the bare fact of existence. The right to be is the right to a space freed from the imperative of doing, from aim, purpose, productivity. It is at least as essential as action to what the declaration calls “the free development of personality”.The right to be has as much bearing on political and economic justice as it does on human health and inner security. If non-productive, aimless time and space is protected as a basic human right, it becomes that bit more difficult for, say, Chinese corporate masters to insist that two five-minute toilet breaks in a 16-hour shift constitute a sufficiently “reasonable” limit on working hours.“There is nothing,” wrote the great American writer Henry David Thoreau, “not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay to life itself, than this incessant business.” Let us declare freedom from this incessant business call it a right to non-work, a right to be, a right to poetry and philosophy or indeed, a right to life itself.In 1910, the German doctor and sexual reformer Magnus Hirschfeld calculated that there were 43m possible combinations of gender and sexuality. His thinking came out of extensive clinical experience. Over the years he had interviewed thousands of people, whose ersity of genitalia, physical appearance and sexual desires astounded him. “The number of actual and imaginable sexual varieties is almost unending,” he wrote. “In each person there is a different mixture of manly and womanly substances, and as we cannot find two leaves alike on a tree, then it is highly unlikely that we will find two humans whose manly and womanly characteristics exactly match in kind and number.”Hirschfeld’s words are radical even now, though versions of them were repeated right through the 20th century. You can, for example, find very similar statements in Virginia Woolf, who thought of herself as not quite one thing or another, who loved both men and women and who was perennially at sea between the fixed poles of gender. Excited by a newspaper story about a pretty young woman who became a man, in 1928 she channelled her feelings into Orlando, her ebullient masterpiece, a novel bent on unsettling binary notions of gender and identity. “Different though the sexes are, they intermix,” it reports. “In every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.”Sexual desire and gender identity are the base notes of bodily experience and yet the wish to organise them into categories of right and wrong, permissible and illicit remains overwhelming. The 1948 Declaration of Human Rights safeguards the right to a nation and the right to be safe from imprisonment, but not the right to express one’s own personal experience of gender nor to choose, within the absolute limits of consent, with whom and how one wishes to conduct a sexual life. A body can be a prison too. You can exile or incarcerate someone simply by defining them against their own living sense of who they are, by forbidding them love or erotic range. And then, of course, you can make their life a misery, regulate their clothes, their use of lavatories and changing rooms, stop them being able to work or marry.Anyone who’s read the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance list of deaths will know the stakes are high. In August 2013, to take a single story, Islan Nettles, a 21-year-old transgender woman, was beaten to death in Harlem. Her assailant was a young man who had been flirting with her when his friends told him Islan had been born a boy. “I just didn’t want to be fooled,” he told the police.What rights would have helped Islan? Not so much a right to self-define, which can be made to sound arbitrary and whimsical, as a right not to be forcibly defined by the state, to have a gender identity imposed from outside, to be told that what you aren’t is natural, and what you are is deviant, wrong, illicit, fake. The right to have the stays of gender unloosed, the right to breathe. The right to transition, to shift, to exceed or refuse the expectations and constraints that have attached to the categories of man and woman. The right to dress in whatever clothes one chooses. The right to love whoever one chooses. The right to be different. The right to be neither. The right to be both.The framers of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights couldn’t foresee that in the 21st century, we would need two sets of rights – one for our lives in the physical world, and one for our lives online. But the beautiful thing is that we don’t, actually, need to rewrite the UDHR for the digital world. We might need an amendment or two, but to begin with, we only need to recognise that the same rights we expect in the physical world should be afforded in the online world, too.Article 12 of the declaration states: “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, no attacks upon his honour or reputation.” Online, countless social media platforms, websites and apps may violate users’ privacy, tracking our movements online, studying and manipulating our digital behaviour, and intercepting and monetising our correspondence. Article 26 of the declaration states that “Everyone has a right to education” and that “Education shall be free”. Increasingly in elementary and secondary schools, students are required to access, complete and submit their homework using digital tools. Given a laptop can cost at least $1,000, and having wifi at home requires monthly payments to private providers, education in such a situation is no longer free.Later in article 26, the UDHR asserts that “Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.” Given the vast wealth of research that proves that increased screen time for children and teenagers leads to higher rates of depression and even suicide, schools that push their pupils into more screen usage are doing three counterproductive things simultaneously: they’re forcing young people on to the screens that have been proved unequivocally to be addictive and harmful they’re making learning more difficult and they’re creating a two-tiered system, whereby those wealthy enough for computers and phones and wifi at home have an easier time accessing their education, while lower income students are left to scramble and to feel inferior.Article 27 asserts that “Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.” The original sin of the digital world was the well-intentioned belief that everything online needed to be free. This led to the hollowing out of the creative middle class, as musicians, journalists, photographers and countless other creators no longer controlled their work, and consumers no longer expected to pay for it. Thus we have now had two generations that can’t conceive of the notion of paying .99 cents to own a song. Because their music is given away for free — or next to free — online, musicians have to tour incessantly to make a living, or else be forced to sell their work for use in car commercials.Articles 28 and 29 are probably the most poignant here. They state that “Everyone is entitled to a social and international order” and that “Everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.” Currently the digital world does a poor job in achieving any of these objectives. Whereas laws of civility govern the physical world and lawmakers and law-enforcers endeavour to keep us safe from harassment and threats, few such protections are afforded online. The digital world is anarchic, and largely without recognition of rights, public order or general welfare. It’s every person for him or herself. That is in opposition to the soul of the UDHR, which envisions a latticework of rights and responsibilities of all humans – one that might keep us responsible to each other and invested in our mutual wellbeing.This is not the feeling we get while online. So the digital world has some work to do. If we add to the UDHR a handful of amendments necessary and specific to the digital world, we just might create a framework within which all but the most outlaw tech entities might operate. Here are two amendments: we need to clarify that all surveillance is inherently abhorrent and should be undertaken only in the interest of law enforcement, and even then, only after an independent judiciary signs off on that surveillance. All other dossier-creation is inherently immoral and stands in clear violation of everything that the UDHR states and implies. If we eliminate all tracking from the web – and all tracking is surveillance, after all – we’d be well on our way to a digital world that actually conformed to the spirit of the UDHR.Most important of all, though, is that we need to ensure that humans in the 21st century will be allowed to enjoy analogue lives. When a student needs a $1,000 device to do her homework, her fundamental rights are being violated. When any government service requires the ownership of a smartphone to gain access to basic services, then their rights are being compromised.

She’s normally a smiler, but is not about to bestow a gummy grin on him – at least, not yet.Niyah and her mother, Rachael Aldrin-Quaye, are at a Christmas party run by the charity Little Village, a baby bank that has its home in a large, brightly decorated church hall in Balham, south London. Rachael was referred when she was pregnant and on a low income. Little Village provided her with 40 items of clothing plus equipment for her unborn baby, including nappies and toys.Aldrin-Quaye cuddles her daughter as she says: “It’s Niyah’s first Father Christmas and he’s been very generous – but it’s Little Village that has made a huge difference to our lives.” The visit for 40 items can be repeated every three months for each child up to the age of five. Little Village understands poverty.Aldrin-Quaye has a spinal condition, so she can’t carry the baby’s buggy. The family live in a rented second-floor, one-bedroom flat costing £600 a month and there’s no lift. Her husband works, but hopes for a better job in January. Rachael is paying off debts incurred at the age of 18 at £5 a month. She is now 32. Soon after Niyah was born, Aldrin-Quaye became a Little Village volunteer, as a number of those referred do. She has also returned many of the items. “Lots of people return stuff, beautifully wrapped,” she says proudly. “It matters, doing something for others.”I spent last week with Little Village at its baby banks in Camden and Balham (it has a third in Southwark). As well as the usual business of distributing baby clothes and equipment, it had Santa giving gifts to the children. Last Christmas, Little Village gave out 350 presents. This year it will be 1,300.“Each of our areas has streets with million-pound houses, and families without beds whose children are sleeping on the floor,” Sophia Parker, founder of Little Village says. “Baby banks ought not to exist – but while they do, we want to be there for every struggling family. It’s not about the rich giving to the poor, but about families helping families in the same community – a cycle of giving.” In 2015 Parker, 40, wanted to give her surplus baby equipment to local families, but she discovered it wasn’t easy. Then, a family nearby with a new baby lost everything in a fire. “I decided I needed to sort this.”Pregnant with her third child, she used local networks to spread the word. The house soon overflowed with contributions. Eventually a room was given in a local church and what was originally an “evening project” for Parker has now become a growing chain of baby banks.Two years on, Little Village has more than 170 volunteers and 10 paid staff who work up to 28 hours a week. “It gives me hope that people are so generous,” says Parker. “But after 20 years working as a policy analyst looking at gender and poverty, I have never felt so angry and so saddened by what is happening in our society.”Britain in the 21st century is a place in which babies are on the breadline. Destitution, holiday hunger and food banks are becoming a shamefully normalised part of life in the fifth richest economy in the world. More than 100 baby banks now operate in the UK, and they helped 35,000 families last year. Last week, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation published its annual report on UK poverty, revealing that half a million more children have moved into poverty over the past five years, lifting the total figure to 4.1 million.In every school class of 30, nine children will be going without. Of the 14 million people in poverty, eight million live in families in which at least one person is in work – the first time in 20 years there has been a rise in this group.At 8.30am on Monday in a north London community centre, Candice Woolfson, 47, Little Village’s Camden site director, prepares the room for a three-hour session. Little Village receives up to 250 referrals a month. They include refugees and families with a disability, women fleeing violence and the working poor. Half of the families are homeless or in temporary accommodation.Woolfson and the stock manager, Barb Chewings, a former pharmacist, pull out equipment and boxes of clothes. A volunteer sits at each table with a referred person or couple and works through a checklist of needs. People are encouraged to exercise choice – a luxury for the poor. “Many have been treated as a number in the system, judged and sanctioned,” Woolfson says. “Some arrive angry and defensive. We train volunteers to be non-judgmental. They don’t try and fix people. It’s about kindness.”Donations from wealthy Hampstead often come by Uber. The rich, obviously, invest a lot more in bringing up baby. Certainly more than a refugee on £5.39 a day or a father on zero hours or the one in three on universal credit paying back an advance. So Little Village provides gifts, “not handouts”, from moderate to de luxe. “We say only donate what you would give to a fussy friend,” Chewings explains.Fundraising brings Little Village £150,000 a year. The aim is to expand to £600,000 a year. Each referral costs £230, mainly covering staff, training and premises. Some parents feel shame that they cannot provide. Children come with shoes two sizes too small and no coat. One mother with an autistic son was moved from a south London refuge to an outer suburb. Her son is happy in the local school, though, so the mother spends £3.60 on bus fares, then walks around all day until school finishes before taking a bus back – anxiety unnecessarily piled on trauma and poverty. Many mothers fear their children will be taken into care in a welfare system that can seem like quicksand, sucking them under. An evaluation under way already demonstrates how Little Village’s ethos, operations and support diminish the stress.Entela is exhausted. She tells how eight months ago she fled an abusive relationship in Albania with her five-year-old son. She was a lawyer. They live on £86 a month from the British Red Cross. She shares a room with him and her friend’s two little daughters. A third of people referred to Little Village have no recourse to public funds. They receive no benefits. It is Entela’s son’s birthday. “He wants one present,” she says, and the tears come.Woolfson and Dehn, a new volunteer, help Entela choose clothes, books and shoes, and add several beautifully wrapped presents. Woolfson suggests to Entela that she return the next day as a volunteer, which she does.“My parents came to Britain after the Vietnam war,” Dehn says later. “Then, there was a tolerance of refugees.” She now has a senior job in advertising. “Little Village made me want to retrain. I can’t change this broken system, but I can help others survive it better.”On Tuesday morning in Balham, volunteers gather for a briefing from site director Rebecca Wilson, 42, a former senior advertising accounts manager, then a childminder. “Little Village is highly professional,” she says. “It’s an idea that works.”Meaghan, 22, is Australian and a business graduate. Currently she is a nanny. Her employer volunteers, too. Meaghan plans to qualify as a social worker. “My mum and dad had substance misuse issues, so when I was little we relied on baby banks,” she says. “I understand the emotions of many of the women who come here, the humiliation. But everyone is treated with respect. That counts.”Volunteer Vicky Jones, 36, has brought daughter Isla, 18 months. They live on universal credit of £1,000 a month, paying back an advance. Jones was referred when pregnant. She was a nursery nurse earning £1,200 a month after tax, paying £500 rent for a shared studio flat. Her relationship ended when Isla was newly born. “I was broke, and crying all the time. I thought I couldn’t be the mum I wanted to be. I came here and a huge burden was lifted from my shoulders. I’ve grown massively in confidence.”She tried to go back to work, but childcare fees have to be paid up front and universal credit payments are deferred. “I’ll try again when Isla is two and I can get 30 hours of free childcare. Little Village is a huge part of my life. Sophia is the sister I never had. Now, I know I can be a role model for my daughter.”On Wednesday morning, the hall is transformed. Volunteers have put up Christmas decorations. Children play. The vestibule, nave and pews of the church are overflowing with clothes, toys, cots, baby gyms and prams from the previous night’s monthly donation drop-in. Space is a challenge. Over the next three hours, 25 families are welcomed. Their circumstances echo the recent damning report by Philip Alston, UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. He said the levels of UK deprivation and misery were a political choice, “a social calamity and an economic disaster”. New Labour lifted a million children out of poverty. It can be done.Rozaline, 28, has two daughters under two. She came from Nigeria with her husband. She moved to a refuge but is on a spousal visa so has no recourse to public funds. Her children are classed as “in need”, so she gets £110 a week from the local authority. They are now in a hostel. She beams at the pile of baby clothes.Shirley Joe, 52, works part-time. Her daughter Abbi, 24, has a son aged four, and another baby due in February. Her contract ended and she hadn’t been employed long enough to get maternity pay. Abbi Joe’s partner is looking for work. The family live with Shirley Joe because they are behind with the rent and can’t afford to use the heating or gas. Abbi Joe has six weeks to wait for her universal credit. Today Shirley Joe is delightedly collecting items for her coming grandchild. “My house is warm there is food on the table. We’ll get by,” she says. “It’s not so bad.” But, in a profoundly unfair society and as long as there is a need for baby banks, it is.This Trussell Trust’s Big Wrap scheme provides Christmas gifts to children whose parents use food banks.Charities including the Salvation Army and the Trussell Trust help people in need with utility bills.Sharewear in Nottingham is among organisations providing emergency bedding and clothes to people in crisis.Like a food bank but providing essential personal care, toiletries and cosmetics instead, Beauty Banks was set up by  writers Sali Hughes and Jo Jones.Charities such as TLG (Transforming Lives for Good) provide a free, healthy lunch during school holidays to children in receipt of free school meals ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d30afd65467e35e6a634ca24aaaf9ef97186004/0_185_5540_3325/master/5540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c46f491f604e63b9ab70ac428092226f","title":"time lord and sherlock holmes perfect team for tourism","story":"Two of Britain’s most famous fictional exports, Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Who, are at the heart of a new generation of “live” immersive attractions designed to draw foreign tourists this winter.Yesterday a Sherlock-themed interactive game, featuring Benedict Cumberbatch and other cast members of the television show, opened to its first paying customers in west London, while next month a new “escape room” experience based on Doctor Who is to open in Bristol before rolling out across five other English cities. Cardiff, creative home of Doctor Who since its 2005 reboot, will also see some of this spin-off action in the new year.The city council confirmed this weekend that it is working with BBC Studios, the corporation’s commercial arm, to set up an experience for Doctor Who fans to be housed in Cardiff’s Norman castle. Called Doctor Who Film Tours and Exhibition, it will share the space with another attraction, the Black Tower Tales, and is thought likely to go up inside the Victorian wing of the castle.“The plans have been approved and we are expecting it will open in the summer,” a spokesman said.The writers behind both BBC shows have been involved in developing the experiences. Mark Gatiss worked with Steven Moffat on the phenomenally popular Sherlock, as well as playing Holmes’s brother Mycroft in the series. They also created the content of the new interactive game in west London. “It was really important to us that it felt like the series,” Gatiss said. “It has an urban, modern look that fans will recognise, but you will still be able to solve some of the puzzles without knowing the show.”Developed with the makers of the Time Run live adventure games, Sherlock: The Game is Now, lasts about 90 minutes, costs £54 and begins in a recreation of the drawing room at 221B, as seen in the television series. It revolves around the idea of participants joining The Network, Holmes’s organisation of amateur sleuths. “Fans across the world now seem to want to be involved rather just watching television,” said Time Run’s Simon Oliveira. For those who have tickets the first challenge will be to find the venue. Next to a Lidl supermarket in a rather tired Shepherd’s Bush shopping centre, a new optician’s store has recently appeared. Called Doyle’s, like Holmes’s creator, it was apparently founded in 1859, the year of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s birth. There could be more to it than meets the eye.Plans for the new Cardiff Doctor Who venture came to light in the minutes of a council cabinet meeting last month. The scheme is part of an attempt to fill a hole in council coffers and to meet the £23m cost of maintaining the city’s historic properties.In September 2017 the Doctor Who Experience, built on land in Cardiff Bay leased from the Welsh government, closed, leaving taxpayers with a £1.1m bill. Income from this attraction, which displayed many of the props from the 55-year-old science fiction series – Jodie Whittaker plays the current Doctor – had fallen below sustainable levels.But there is new faith in the appeal of both escape rooms and immersive theatre such as Punchdrunk’s acclaimed shows and Secret Cinema’s themed screenings. To tap into this thirst for live experiences, the company behind Escape Hunt games is launching Doctor Who: Worlds Collide in Bristol in mid-January. The next game will open the following week in Leeds, with sites in Oxford and Manchester opening in February, and Reading and Birmingham in March. They are billed as 60-minute, live opportunities to help the Doctor mend “a tear in space and time” before the Cybermen break through.The Doctor Who Escape Rooms are the first of what BBC Studios describe as “a raft of Doctor Who attractions, activities and experiences that are in the pipeline”. Work on another Doctor Who attraction due to open in 2023 at a Kent theme park continues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/047ccd75a4b95d43760e24dec34b56b86af44042/0_73_2904_1742/master/2904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=377c77cb2477ce9ee6f3f5161993e8d2","title":"kevin hart oscars host unenlightened black homophobe trope","story":"It’s easy for white liberals to imagine homophobia as the fault of a cartoonish black character even though black people hardly wield the power that drives itI couldn’t care less about Kevin Hart or the Oscars. Hollywood doesn’t care about us, so why should we care about them? But this episode has given fuel to a dangerous trope: of the unenlightened black homophobe who must be corrected by wiser white liberals. And that’s what makes me angry.As the literary and performance artist Jayy Dodd wrote on Twitter: “white folks love homophobic black ppl cuz it’s like A THING they can point to as BAD, when it’s affluent conservative \u0026amp silent moderate white folks making LGBTQ™ life in this country so difficult.”Dodd’s words hit home for me. In just the past week, the US has shamefully seen white liberal news journalists – even white gay journalists such as the New York Times’ Frank Bruni and Adam Nagourney – fail to hold George HW Bush accountable for his homophobic positions, policies and actions. Given that tens of thousands of gay men died of Aids during his presidency, Bush wielded far more homophobic power than Hart ever could, even if he had hosted as many Oscars as Billy Crystal.While the homophobic Bush has been widely praised in media for his “grace”, noblesse oblige and “thousand points of light”, the criticism of his homophobia has been scant. At the same time, the pile on targeting a black comic has been hard.Hart has willfully played the historic, mythological role of the black bogeyman ruining gay rights. And it is a myth. This tale really got going in 2008 when Dan Savage incorrectly blamed “black homophbia” for the passage of the anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 – even though the measure passed by more than the number of Black voters in California. I saw this myth spread when I was reporting on same-sex marriage equality moving through the New York senate in 2011, as many people loudly worried it might not pass because of people of color, even though just about every legislator of color but one (Rubén Díaz Sr) supported marriage equality while the white legislators were split.When white liberals started to think that gay rights were cool, they imagined themselves as more enlightened on the subject than people with darker skin … even though anti-gay laws in African were imported by European colonizers. Even though most major US federal gay rights wins happened under a Black president. Even though a majority of US Muslims are for gay marriage rights while a majority of white evangelicals are against them.It is easy for white liberals to imagine homophobia as the fault of a cartoonish black character in their mind even though black people hardly wield the social, financial and legal power which drives homophobia in the world.It’s difficult for liberals to reckon with how LGBT people could never be as harmed by the likes of Hart as they have been by Bush’s inaction on Aids, by Bill Clinton’s anti-gay marriage (the Defense of Marriage Act) and military (“Don’t ask, don’t tell”) policies , by George W Bush’s warmongering, and by the majority of white people who elected the current homophobe in the oval office.When Ellen DeGeneres hosted the Oscars in 2016, gay rights groups were more vocal about what her lesbian visibility meant than they were when she had homophobic George W Bush  on her show a year later. Gay people were no better or worse off in life when DeGeneres hosted than they would have been if Hart had hosted. Because, ultimately, it doesn’t matter who hosts the Oscars because the Oscars don’t matter.There are more important frames for battling homophobia and fighting for justice than a glorified Hollywood sales pitch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9117cbf262f399ff513521c616bbca87840e7ec/290_0_1340_804/master/1340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8056b879255a6d841de08dd434ba5f42","title":"working mums christmas schmaltz bbc","story":"For those who’ve yet to see the BBC Christmas advert, Wonderland, the one that’s caused a furore, it’s a heartwarming tale of a harassed mother bunking off from work to hang out with her child, which, unwittingly, employs a somewhat unfestive good mumbad mum narrative.Bad mum is first seen (selfishly) prioritising her career (translation: leaving for work) over her teenage son’s desperate yearning to hang out with her at a funfair. However, while bad mum is in the office, coldly neglecting her family, cackling evilly over her keyboard (I may be embellishing slightly here), she’s struck by a revelation (and some time-stopping gimmick) about “What Really Matters”, and runs off to meet her son and go on the dodgems with him. By which point, she’s become good mum – whether that’s good sacked mum for leaving the office during what appears to be a frantically busy working day remains tantalisingly unclear.Even in the realm of yuletide adverts (increasingly an annual creative vortex where all bad, cynically soppy ideas strangle themselves on festive tinsel and die), this one fritzes like dodgy Christmas tree lights. Sure, some parents have the option of leaving work on a whim – they’re called things like the owner or the boss. If this mother is a key breadwinner, shouldn’t she be supported and appreciated? What about the mysterious fatherstepfather, seen only once, eating breakfast – in the interests of realism, shouldn’t there be at least one heated parental text exchange, arguing about who should go to the fair, and berating each other for being useless?Would a teenager even want to hang out with his mother that much? Over many decades, teenagers have acquired quite a reputation for, let’s say, preferring their own society – could someone kindly inform the BBC about this?However, the main problem with the advert is the anti-working mother message that’s been rightly berated as a guilt trip. That a woman’s decision to work is self-centred, unnecessary, disruptive and ultimately harmful to children. That a working mum’s only hope of redemption is to feel relentless and corrosive maternal guilt. And that, when mothers decide not to work, or to put work a distant second, suddenly all is well, the sun comes out, and little bluebirds start fluttering around the family unit.In many cases, it’s only because mothers go to work that hard-pressed families manage to survive at all. Then, there are mothers who (whisper it) enjoy working. In fairness to the BBC, there’s nothing wrong with addressing some of the harsher realities families face, or for trying to produce a more realistic kind of Christmas advert – one that isn’t just about beatific nuclear families lolling around in unicorn onesies, rejoicing over Morecambe and Wise repeats.Maybe, one day, a working mum will be cast in a positive light, portrayed doing her job, because her family probably needs the money, but also, because maybe she enjoys it. Now that would be a true Christmas miracle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dee56655375e2828fa376481cef07e3f9a9c788/0_0_4893_3103/master/4893.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cfd3e78510c1cb3f683d79800b4e126 645w","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

Disney’s Nutcracker revamp, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, stars Keira Knightley and cost about $130m, making it one of the most expensive Christmas-themed movies ever made. Now, with paltry earnings of only $20m on its first US weekend, it has been declared a flop. As Forbes magazine noted in a doom-laden appraisal, “$130 million is way too much to spend on a Christmas movie”.The film suffered production troubles, with the original director replaced during shooting, but perhaps something more than behind-the-scenes woes and an over-inflated budget is to blame. Reviewing the film in the , Cath Clarke missed “the melancholy darkness” of the original ETA Hoffmann story. And if there’s one ingredient Christmas stories need, it’s that. Nothing says festive cinema quite like the prospect of despair and disaster.Yes, there are exceptions. Elf is as twinkly as the lights on Regent Street, as is the shrill Nativity! series of junior-school Britcoms, now on its fourth instalment with Nativity Rocks!. But the best Christmas films usually have a bit of grit in the trifle. That’s true of It’s a Wonderful Life and Die Hard, both re-released this month, as well as The Grinch (a new animated version is in cinemas now) which concerns one grump’s campaign to kill off Christmas.In the 1944 film Meet Me in St Louis, a distraught child destroys the snowmen in her garden, and Judy Garland sings the most equivocal Christmas song of all time, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. It’s a Wonderful Life and Trading Places (the 1983 comedy starring Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy) feature suicide attempts brought on by the threat of poverty and prison.In Home Alone, the biggest seasonal hit of all time, a child, played by Macaulay Culkin, is abandoned by his parents and terrorised by criminals.And in When Harry Met Sally, Billy Crystal declares: “Boy, the holidays are rough. Every year I just try to get from the day before Thanksgiving to the day after New Year’s.”Unless we’re going all the way back to Herod, the blame must be laid at the feet of Charles Dickens. A Christmas Carol was published more than 50 years before the birth of cinema but its impact on early filmmaking was profound. Silent adaptations proliferated, imbuing in the idea of Christmas not only the last-ditch miracle of redemption, represented by Ebenezer Scrooge, but some sense of the almighty slog necessary to reach that goal.Dickens was also the governing influence on It’s a Wonderful Life. In Frank Capra’s often-misunderstood film, George Bailey (James Stewart) tries to kill himself and is dissuaded not by the love of his family or the joy of Christmas but by an intervening angel who shows him how much worse the world would have been without him. When George finally returns home, the dastardly banker Henry F Potter (Lionel Barrymore) is more powerful than ever. Christmas in the film is merely a sticking plaster beneath which the world’s ills are unchanged. Will it still be such a wonderful life come January?And it wasn’t meant to be a Christmas film at all. Its original release date of 30 January 1947 was brought forward only when another film on the RKO schedule wasn’t finished in time.“I didn’t even think of it as a Christmas story,” said Capra. After being panned by critics (“It’s a Wonderful Life will be gone like a Christmas tree smothered with sweets and crackers,” the Daily  wrote), it was sold to television in the 1950s. It happened to fall out of copyright in 1974, whereupon TV channels realised they could show it without paying a fee. A film that argued for love over money now owes its longevity to a financial loophole.The real gift that keeps on giving is A Christmas Carol. The 1984 version, starring George C Scott as Scrooge, was released five years into Thatcher’s tenure, and critic Pam Cook wrote in Monthly Film Bulletin that its appearance at a time of increasing economic crisis “makes its paternalistic message especially seasonal”.This idea is seen in its most extreme form in Joe Dante’s 1984 films Gremlins, where gift-giving leads directly to a violent frenzy when the present itself, an exotic fluffy pet, spawns marauding offspring, some of which even kill Santa Claus himself.Bob Clark, who directed 1983’s A Christmas Story, argued that truth was vital to any successful Christmas film. “If they don’t come back to reality, they aren’t going to touch you,” he said. But then he was unusual in that as well as making the sugary-sweet A Christmas Story, soaked in nostalgia for a wholesome 1950s childhood, he also directed the 1974 slasher movie Black Christmas, in which Margot Kidder’s cries as she is killed are drowned out by jolly carol singing. Watching them as a double bill shows that Clark knew happiness and horror – the fear that Christmas is about to go disastrously wrong – to be two sides of the same chocolate coin.In failing to acknowledge the darker side of Christmas, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms may have guaranteed its own demise.The Nutcracker and the Four Realms and Nativity Rocks! are on general release nowDelightful Comedy by Ernst Lubitsch stars James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan falling in love at Christmas.

In Denmark he’s the only director who tells stories on that scale – he tells stories of biblical proportions about good and evil, death and life, these really grand themes and questions.Was your section in the film traumatic to shoot?I have to disappoint you. It obviously wasn’t pleasant, but the environment Lars created was so loving and safe and calm that we were able to shoot these quite disturbing scenes. The funny thing from an actor’s perspective is that you have this strangely masochistic or sadistic relationship with your work – you want your character to suffer, that’s what you really want to play, isn’t it? And you normally have to do classical theatre to play these huge dramatic tones. But you get to play them with Lars von Trier.Your sequence might alarm fans of Sarah Lund, who are used to seeing you being tough.Lars is the master of female portraits. It’s very rare that he chooses to tell a story from a masculine perspective, and this is a very merciless portrait of a man. You can’t accuse him of having a stereotyped view of women – he’s portrayed women in interesting, nuanced ways. Here he takes a very harsh male perspective – he chooses to have this very distant, one-dimensional view on the female characters. I didn’t even have a name in the script, I was “Lady 3”, and that was very much on purpose.What was working with Matt Dillon like? He’s unrecognisably scary as Jack.He was extremely sweet and easygoing. When I was young, he was like the Marlon Brando of our generation, he was someone I had a huge crush on. So I was very star-struck, but that lasted for an instant because he was so nice to be with.What’s Von Trier like on set? The general perception of him is that he’s super-intense and depressive.He’s a very caring person, which might surprise people. He’s not like his films at all – he has an absolutely brilliant, very dark sense of humour. He’s very open and very direct – maybe that’s the most Danish part of him, because he’s not very Danish in his art. You can tell by looking at him and listening to him that it has a great price for him to be the artist that he is – you can believe that he’s very familiar with the hell that he reports from.He comes to the set extremely prepared, but when he’s going to shoot, he puts himself and everyone else in a situation where you’re not protected by all your preparation. He has a motto when he works. In Danish, it’s husk at sjusk: husk means remember, sjusk means to be sloppy – so it means “remember to make mistakes”. With any other director, it’s a virtue to come well prepared, but with Lars it’s almost a sin.You have two children, now in their teens. When you were in The Killing, was it strange for them to see how famous you’d become?I always kept my children very far away from my work life – not any more, because now they can put everything in perspective. But during The Killing, they knew I was an actor but that was about it. When my daughter was nine or 10, she had a friend whose father is a singer – I was walking with her in a mall, and there was a poster of her friend’s father, who was doing a concert. She saw it, paused, and said: “I wonder what it’s like to have a famous parent like that?” I felt: mission accomplished!You recently made a comedy with director Paprika Steen, That Time of Year, about a family having a terrible Christmas. Is that a very Danish thing – to be ironic about Christmas?I think you are maybe the masters of irony, aren’t you, in Great Britain? We do like irony, we like punctuating the melodrama. We’ve thrown a lot of our traditions away and pretty much the only thing we have is Christmas. You know the Danish word hygge? In Denmark, Christmas Eve is the concentration of hygge – that evening, we have to fulfil all our dreams of the happy family having hygge together. So that film is about how badly it can go.Earlier this year you shot a BBC TV series – period drama Gentleman Jack, created by Sally Wainwright, of Happy Valley fame.Ah, but you know what? I’m in it for one scene, that’s it. It’s an extremely small part, but a very significant scene. I read the script and it was so well written. I’m sorry to say I haven’t seen any of her work, but you always recognise a really good writer. I thought she was a fabulous woman to talk to, extremely down to earth and intelligent and funny. And Suranne Jones! My God, I was completely thrown – she’s just so radiant, I was completely mesmerised by her.In it, you play Queen Marie of Denmark. You’ve also played Queen Margaret of Denmark on stage in the UK (in The James Plays)…Maybe that’s my niche. Do you have any more Danish queens for me? Because I only get to play them abroad.The House That Jack Built is released on 14 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaab4a9511ddf9b6b9d031a842ac2045a7f1433a/0_264_3840_2303/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9275fae06b9ee2acb9fe067b3ac932dd","title":"yotam ottolenghis alternative christmas recipes","story":"A non-traditional Christmas spread of spicy roast lamb, aromatic potato gratin and a tangy cucumber saladWatch Yotam and Grace Dent’s Christmas dinner videoIn these unusual times, Christmas seems the only ‘safe place’ for custom and ritual. But even this most traditional of feasts cannot escape controversy. Do we celebrate it at all? And, if so, do we do it with any of the usual religious symbols, or in a more general, humanistic way?In our house, now that I, an agnostic Jew, have succumbed to the idea of celebrating the birthday of the son of God, the arguments focus on the best distraction I know: food. The stakes aren’t as high and the rewards far tastier. My husband Karl, who isn’t at all traditional, wants this to be the one time of year when he can pass on to our two sons something directly connected to his own childhood. ‘Don’t poncify Christmas,’ he says if I dare suggest anything remotely inconsistent with the turkey-stuffing-potatoes-brussels of his early years in Northern Ireland. And so out goes my brilliant idea of democratising the table by banishing the turkey and trimmings altogether, and replacing them with a Middle Eastern meze.To be fair, I see the point of holding on to food traditions when they are genuinely rooted in a personal or national story. Food isn’t only a distracter, it’s also a great caretaker of memory. That is why our only change from tradition is a few pomegranate seeds on the sprouts.I also accept that one big thing in the centre of the table enhances and focuses the feast. It needn’t be a turkey – today’s lamb shoulder does a very good job – but the sense of occasion is really helped by something properly grand. Whatever you do, though, eat, eat some more and be very, very merry.This is a marvellous festive dish – so much better than turkey – in which the juices from the spicy lamb are used to dress the aubergines, injecting them with a tremendous amount of flavour. Don’t be alarmed by the amount of salt in the aubergine: it mostly steams away as it cooks.1.8kg bone-in lamb shoulder, patted dry and pierced all over with a skewer350ml dry white wine1 whole garlic bulb, top fifth cut off to expose the cloves6 large, mild red chillies, cut in half lengthways and deseeded6 banana shallots, peeled2 cinnamon sticks, roughly crushed4 aubergines, green tops trimmed1½ tbsp roasted and salted peanuts, roughly chopped3 spring onions, green ends very finely sliced on an angle2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely cut into julienne strips2 tbsp coriander leaves, finely sliced1 tbsp Chinkiang black vinegar, or normal rice-wine vinegarFor the marinadeFlaked sea salt and black pepper1½ tbsp cumin seeds, lightly toasted1 tbsp Szechuan pepper1¾ tsp chilli flakes5 small garlic cloves, peeled5 black garlic cloves90ml soy sauce60g soft dark brown sugar65ml Chinkiang black vinegar, or normal rice-wine vinegarPut the lamb skin side up in a 35cm x 25cm high-sided baking tray, then rub all over with a tablespoon of flaked salt and plenty of pepper. In a spice grinder or mortar, blitz or grind the cumin, Szechuan pepper and chilli to a coarse powder. Add both garlics and the soy sauce, and blitz or pound to a smooth paste. Tip into a bowl, stir in the sugar and vinegar, then massage all over the lamb. Cover with clingfilm and refrigerate, ideally for two days and at least overnight.Take the lamb out of the fridge two hours before you want to cook it, so it comes up to room temperature. Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)320Fgas 2½. Surround the lamb with the wine, 500ml water, the garlic bulb, chillies, shallots and cinnamon. Roast for an hour and a half, then baste the lamb and cover tightly with foil. Return to the oven and roast, covered, for four hours more, until very soft. Turn up the heat to 190C (170C fan)375Fgas 5, remove the foil, baste the lamb again and roast for another 15 minutes, until browned and slightly caramelised. Leave to cool for 10 minutes, then skim off as much fat as possible from the top of the cooking juices.Half an hour before the lamb is ready, cut the aubergines into 2cm-thick x 7cm-long batons, then toss in a large bowl with two and a half tablespoons of flaked salt. Fill a large saucepan with enough water to come 3cm up the sides and bring to a boil. Put a large steamer over the pan, then lay in the aubergines and cover with the lid (or seal well with foil). Turn down the heat to medium-high and steam for 18 minutes, until very soft but holding their shape. Transfer the steamer basket to the sink and leave to drain for a few minutes.Transfer the aubergines to a large bowl with the peanuts, spring onions, ginger and coriander. Remove the chillies and garlic from the lamb. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins, and add to the aubergines with the chillies. Stir together gently, being careful not to break up the aubergines.Transfer 75ml of the lamb cooking juices to a small saucepan on a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of Chinkiang vinegar and keep warm. Transfer the lamb, shallots and remaining jus to a large platter and arrange the aubergine beside it. Pour the warm jus and vinegar on top of the aubergines, and serve.This is lighter than a dauphinoise or boulangère, so works very well with the fatty lamb. If you’re making the whole of today’s Christmas spread in one oven, bake the gratin ahead of time and reheat in a very hot oven just before serving.

Put the shallots, garlic, oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a 28cm ovenproof saute pan on a medium heat. Fry for eight to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and deeply golden, then tip into a large bowl. Keep the pan to be used again (no need to clean it).Put the potatoes, coconut cream, lime juice, two teaspoons of salt and plenty of pepper in with the shallots and mix very gently, taking care not to break up the potato slices. Lay a quarter of this mixture in the saute pan – use any smaller or broken slices of potato at this stage, and save the larger, whole slices for the top – and spread out in an even layer. Lay the remaining potato mixture in a spiral on top of this base layer, with each slice at an angle and overlapping the next. Pour on the stock, cover tightly with foil and bake for 40 minutes.Meanwhile, make the aromatics. Heat the oil in a medium pan on a medium flame, then gently fry the chilli, garlic and ginger for five minutes, stirring once in a while, until the garlic is just starting to turn golden. Add the spring onions, fry for two minutes more, until the garlic is a light golden brown and the chilli aromatic, then transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon, to stop them cooking further reserve the aromatic oil.Remove the gratin from the oven and discard the foil. Drizzle 60ml aromatic oil evenly over the top, then return to the oven uncovered and bake for 50 minutes more.

Chinkiang vinegar is a rice-based black vinegar that you’ll find in any good Asian supermarket. It has a very particular taste that’s both acidic and umami all at once.

The waspish presence who has breathed such effervescence into Arsenal’s midfield was the difference to break a tight, tense deadlock with an improvised overhead kick. Huddersfield’s unrelenting efforts meant Arsenal needed to extend themselves, to persevere, to keep plugging away to prise all three points out of this game. That kind of attitude seems to come naturally to Torreira.“We want to break every expectation with players and he is improving and works every day with good commitment and behaviour,” Unai Emery said. “He has the hunger we need. He can do very good work in defensive moments and he can get into the box and score.”The last time these teams met was an occasion that marked the curtain coming down on the Arsène Wenger era, and Emery has proved himself a man unafraid to reshape the team as he did again here, and eager to recharge the energy levels. At the end of a demanding week his players found enough to scrap it out. In the seven minutes of stoppage time he was so engrossed as to wander all the way across into David Wagner’s technical area to beckon Sead Kolasinac over for a quick instruction.Huddersfield, like all of Arsenal’s Premier League opponents so far this season, got themselves safely to half-time. But a 0-0 scoreline did not reflect the nature of an increasingly fiesty and complicated game, with tempers heating up and the yellow card count veering out of control – five dished out over a five-minute spell set an intense tone. Huddersfield competed diligently, rising the challenge set by Wagner to prove they could restrict Arsenal and give themselves a platform.There were chances, including a piledriver from Torreira which was parried brilliantly by Jonas Lössl, and when Alexandre Lacazette found the net he was aghast to be penalised for a tight offside decision earlier in the move.Emery wasted no time in shaking it up. While his instinct was to push for the breakthrough, there were growing concerns at the back. Sokratis and Shkodran Mustafi picked up their fifth bookings of the season and will be serve a suspension at a time when the squad are very short of fit and match-sharp centre-backs. Mustafi then hobbled off injured with what Emery described as a “small” hamstring.Laurent Koscielny’s appearance on the bench after a seven-month absence was timely but Arsenal have to use him cautiously after such a bad injury, so Nacho Monreal came on instead. The defensive trio for the closing stages comprised Granit Xhaka flanked by Monreal (nominally a left-back) and Sokratis. Remarkably, they held it together for a first clean sheet in the Premier League since September.Huddersfield contributed wholeheartedly, even if they missed some cutting edge. Alex Pritchard scooped one effort over and later on appealed in vain for a penalty. Arsenal’s increasing desperation showed as Mattéo Guendouzi was booked for ing (a third for simulation during the game). The teenager was more productive in the 83rd minute prising Huddersfield open with a well crafted ball for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Gabonese found room to chip over a cross and Torreira was there to deliver another big moment for his new club.Wagner felt his team deserved something. “Because of defensive shift and effort and tactical quality we limited Arsenal and kept them away from our goal. That’s enough if you are Huddersfield Town to deserve a point,” he said. “Unfortunately we don’t have it. I can see the positives.”Now 21 games unbeaten for Arsenal, on they go. “The injuries and yellow cards are coming with matches,” Emery said. He will need to keep shuffling to find solutions. Having bustled around all game long, he is looking forward to a couple of days off to clear his busy head."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7347f7914da767c62d77d6022dde62b7fd9bb2e0/108_577_4810_2886/master/4810.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2118b04acc252ee2a5439b6c1a35107b","title":"chelsea manchester city premier league match report","story":"Now, perhaps, we can understand why Pep Guardiola did not want to entertain any questions before this match about the possibility of Manchester City going unbeaten through the entire season. The Invincibles mark II? Not quite. The champions have been reminded what it feels like to lose in the league eight months since it last happened, and suddenly it is Guardiola’s team playing catch-up towards the top of the table.On this evidence it is also fair to say that Liverpool, the new leaders, can be encouraged to think their nearest challengers are not quite as flawless as many people believed. For starters, there is no point outpassing opponents if you don’t outscore them, as City did here before N’Golo Kanté put Chelsea into a surprise lead just before half-time. Guardiola’s men had plenty of time to save themselves but gave a surprisingly feeble response and a splendid victory for Chelsea was sealed by David Luiz’s 78th-minute header from a badly defended corner.That made it, by some distance, the most satisfying result yet for Chelsea of the Maurizio Sarri era, while Guardiola may have to concede it did not work to start this match with Raheem Sterling operating through the middle. City undoubtedly missed Sergio Agüero during the early periods of the game when they were let down by a lack of penalty-box ruthlessness. David Silva went off with a hamstring strain and, perhaps for the first time, it could also be said City badly needed Kevin de Bruyne, the matchwinner in this fixture last season.Tactically, Chelsea did something similar with their own frontline, with Eden Hazard playing through the middle and Álvaro Morata not even included among their substitutes. Yet it was not always easy to gauge the success of this experiment, simply because the home team found it difficult to build up any concerted pressure in attacking positions. Hazard could be seen at one point turning to Sarri, arms outstretched, as if to say he was not particularly relishing his new role. Not even half an hour had been played and, at that stage, not many people would have backed Chelsea to deliver the first goal.If nothing else, it was a reminder that City, having been behind for a grand total of 12 minutes in all their previous league fixtures this season, have not reached a point of football perfection. True, Guardiola’s players could be forgiven for thinking that, on the balance of play, it was bordering on ludicrous that they were behind. But this is what can happen when a side does not make the most of its superiority and, a minute before half-time, Chelsea punished their opponents by being more ruthless with their first chance of the game.This was the only time in the entire 45 minutes that City were stretched, with Kyle Walker caught out of position, and when Hazard cut the ball between two defenders Kanté was quicker than any of his opponents to react. The ball was rolling invitingly his way and Kanté’s shot from close to the penalty spot was still rising as it flew into the roof of the net.Until that point, the pattern of the game had followed what has happened throughout the rest of City’s season, with Guardiola’s team elegant in possession, knocking the ball around with immense confidence and bold enough to use Fernandinho as their only defence-orientated midfielder in what was, at times, a 4-1-5 formation. Ederson refrained from trying any no-look passes or keepie-ups inside his own six-yard area, as he had in the midweek win at Watford, but neither was the Brazilian particularly troubled before Chelsea surprised everybody, perhaps even themselves, by taking the lead.Leroy Sané, who was guilty of losing Kanté for Chelsea’s goal, had three opportunities alone, at 0-0, to turn City’s superiority into the hard currency of goals. The best opportunity of the first half, however, came in the eighth minute when Sterling was unable to finish off a swift counter-attacking move.Chelsea began the second half as though determined that it would not follow the same pattern of the opening 45 minutes and, having started the match with a false nine, Guardiola soon brought on a real one in the form of Gabriel Jesus, albeit wearing the number 33 shirt. Sané was removed, with Sterling switching to the left, and Riyad Mahrez often looking like their best hope on the opposite side.By the time the game reached its hour mark, however, City had stopped passing the ball anywhere near as effectively. Soon afterwards, the visitors also had to contend with an injury to Silva, who was replaced by Ilkay Gündogan. Chelsea had lost Mateo Kovacic the same way but were now looking far more controlled with their passing. This was a new challenge for City – losing, deprived of key players – and it was rare to see Guardiola’s men suddenly looking short of ideas.Guardiola was aggrieved about the corner decision that led to David Luiz’s goal but the replays confirmed the ball had gone out via a faint touch off Mahrez’s foot. City’s manager should have been more concerned with his team’s marking as their 21-match unbeaten run came to an abrupt halt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07df1b1766af39152a0c16ae941e3737ff60fc13/0_55_2724_1634/master/2724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a34cb9fe44487c8b740a360f134e1c0e","title":"manchester united fulham premier league match report","story":"If only Manchester United could play Fulham every week people might begin to take them more seriously. The joke before kick-off at Old Trafford was that Liverpool had done United a favour by winning so handsomely at Bournemouth, because goal difference might be important in the battle for eighth place.Enter the Premier League’s bottom club, with a performance to prove the table does not lie, and suddenly United are not just above Bournemouth but up to sixth. Admittedly Everton do not play until Monday but José Mourinho will take what he can at the moment.“We are unbeaten in four league games,” the allegedly happy one said beforehand, which was one way of putting positive spin on the fact United had not picked up a win since before Bonfire Night. “We were good at every level in the first half,” the manager said. “We played like I want us to play, we were a compact unit that gave Fulham no chances.”Fulham were kind enough to let United boost their goal difference with their biggest win of the season, and although a significant gap remains to the top five, Mourinho and his players are at least in the right place to be pushing for a Champions League spot.On the edge of the European positions sounds a lot better than mid-table obscurity, though a truer test will come at Anfield next Sunday. Claudio Ranieri’s strugglers were far too easily dominated, with the Italian reduced from an early stage to standing on the touchline with a resigned look and extended right hand to show his players the direction they were supposed to be playing. With just Aleksandar Mitrovic ploughing a lonely furrow up front it never happened, and Fulham looked beaten from the moment Ashley Young opened the scoring.The United captain initially appeared likely to attempt a cross when he took the ball high on the left but once he beat Denis Odoi to find space in the area he caught sight of goal and found Sergio Rico’s top corner with a curling right-foot drive.Juan Mata scored next, applying a confident finish after Marcus Rashford cut back the ball from the goalline. Romelu Lukaku was criticised earlier in the week for not doing much except trying to score goals, so he should be quite proud of the pass that played Rashford behind the Fulham defence. Rashford then had the awareness to pick out Mata at the back of the penalty area, and when his shot beat Rico’s e the contest was as good as over.The Fulham fans certainly seemed to think so. “You’re nothing special, we lose every week,” was the chant from the travelling support.Rico produced a good stop to keep out a thunderous free-kick from Rashford, before United increased their lead just before the interval with a slick triangular passing move that clearly pleased Mourinho. Jesse Lingard found Mata, whose first-time ball along the six-yard line was neatly tucked away by Lukaku.Fulham showed a little more life after Ranieri made two half-time substitutions, though their best chance in open play fell to André Schürrle following a weak clearance by Diogo Dalot, and the winger skied his shot. It summed up Fulham’s afternoon when less than two minutes after Aboubakar Kamara had pulled a goal back from the penalty spot, following a foul on the substitute by Ander Herrera, they went down to 10 men when a studs-up challenge on Rashford by André-Frank Zambo Anguissa brought a second yellow.Any hopes of United running up a cricket score were dashed when Rico managed saves from Rashford and then Lukaku, although the goalkeeper was beaten at his near post when Rashford scored an audacious fourth from the angle of the area.Had Fred not tried a risky pass rather than a straightforward one in stoppage time United might have hit five in the league for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down.In the end Fulham were not quite that obliging but it was close. “It is quite simple,” Ranieri said with his usual pithiness. “If we play like we did in the first half, we will be relegated. Play like we did in the second and we can survive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0339a4ffb9b49e24301cfbaa717f59b46eee4cfd/532_239_4940_2964/master/4940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c19bb2971ab8d8517620d7bcb834c2b","title":"chelsea v manchester city premier league live","story":"N’Golo Kante and David Luiz scored the goals as Chelsea weathered a first half storm to inflict a first league defeat of the season on the championsOur chief football correspondent Daniel Taylor was at Stamford Bridge to see Chelsea inflict a first Premier League defeat of the season on Manchester City. Here’s his on-the-whistle report.The final match of the day is about to kick off at the King Power Stadium. You can follow it here with Simon Burnton. How the top of the league standsMore on that incident: Debate is currently raging on social media whether the angry Chelsea fan referred to Sterling as a “Manc” or a “black” c-word. Yes, it’s come to this folks.A rather unsavoury incident to report: During the 59th or 60th minute, I thought I spotted a bespectacled, middle-aged Chelsea fan shouting toxic racial abuse at Raheem Sterling as he collected the ball for a throw-in or corner. I didn’t mention it at the time just in case I was mistaken, but a quick post-match perusal of Twitter suggests I might have been correct. The man in question is clearly identifiable and will almost certainly be named, shamed and hopefully charged by the police.David Luiz speaks: “I think it was a great game,” he tells BT Sport. “You have to be honest. We were playing against the best team in Europe or the world at the moment. We were set to suffer and when you have to suffer you have a lot of humility and then we tried to take our chance to score. Humility was the key today and I think all the team did great.” N’Golo Kante speaks: “It was a great game and we had some difficult moments,” he says. “We had to suffer. The most important is to give my best on the pitch. I am happy to do my best on the pitch and happy to get my second goal of the season.” Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! One Step Beyond by Madness blares out over the tannoy as the players go through their post-match niceties. It was a game of two halves - Chelsea were dominated throughout the first, but went in at the interval with an unlikely lead. They took the game to City in the second half, dominated and scored a second to put the game beyond the reigning champions.90+4 min: Chelsea fans are loving this. Ole-ing away as their players ping the ball around the pitch. Kepa misplaces a pass and the ball falls for Gabriel Jesus. His shot is saved by the goalkeeper, who atones for his error. Moments later, Kyle Walker shoots high over the bar. 90+3 min: Chelsea will finish the match in third, by the way, with Spurs still to play against Leicester. 90+2 min: We’re halfway through the extras and Chelsea can hardly blow it from here. Liverpool will end the day as league leaders by a point from Manchester City.89 min: Bernardo sends the ball in. David Luiz can only half clear and after having a couple of shots blocked, Manchester City fire wide from distance courtesy of Fernandinho.88 min: Down on the touchline, Pep Guardiola is still moaning at the fourth official. Beside him, his opposite number Maurizio Sarri is almost certainly gasping for a cigarette at this stage. City win a corner. 87 min: Sterling sends a cross into the mixer with venomous pace. Running on to it, Gabriel Jesus tries to steer the ball goalwards, but fails to hit the target. 85 min: Maybe Pep wasn’t wrong after all - having seen the replay again, I’m not convinced Chelsea should have got the corner from which they scored. For all that, it was only a corner and if Ilkay Gundogan hadn’t lost his man or City had a couple of men on the posts, Chelsea wouldn’t have scored.84 min: City plough on in search of a goal, but Rudiger boots the ball clear unceremoniously. Man City substitution: Phil Foden on for Riyad Mahrez. 82 min: Nobody does calamitous performances quite like David Luiz, a terrific player who has fully redeemed himself after his absolute horror show against Tottenham. He helped create the first goal and has scored the second at Stamford Bridge tonight. 79 min: That was Chelsea’s first corner of the game and they’ve scored from it. Pep Guardiola is furious on the touchline and spent the immediate aftermath of the goal remonstrating with the fourth official, Andre Marriner. He seems to think Chelsea shouldn’t have had a corner. Replays show he was wrong.It was a fine header from Luiz, who had to twist his body in mid-air and really attack the ball with his big hairy head. Chelsea double their lead: They win a corner and David Luiz scores with a fine near post header that Ederson didn’t get near. 77 min: The clock ticks on as Manchester City continue their search for a winner. They’ve had plenty of possession, but have created very little. Chelsea substitution: Ruben Loftus-Cheek on for Willian.75 min: Kante dodges a bullet as he’s robbed of possession in midfield after being blindsided by a galloping Raheem Sterling in midfield. It looked like the Man City forward had a clear path towards goal, but Kante somehow scrambled to get a foot in and win the ball back. 73 min: Azpilicueta has been outstanding tonight and now takes the ball past Delph and releases Hazard up the right flank. Laporte takes the Chelsea man down and concedes a free-kick in line with the front of the City penalty area. It’s squandered on the back of a poor delivery.72 min: Azpilicueta to the rescue again, conceding another corner as Raheem Sterling threatened. Nothing comes of it. 70 min: Alonso escapes down the left flank and picks out Hazard. His cross is wayward. 69 min: City win a corner as rain falls at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea clear, with Azpilicueta unceremoniously hoofing the ball down the pitch.68 min: Yep, Silva limps off and is replaced by Ilkay Gundogan. It’s all going pear-shaped for City, for whom the injuries are mounting up. Having said that, they’re not exactly low on quality back-up. 67 min: Corrections and clarifications dept: Bernardo Silva, who was already on the pitch did not replace Leroy Sane in the 53rd minute, it was Gabriel Jesus. Apologies. Pep could be forced to make another change very shortly, as David Silva is struggling with what looks like a hamstring injury. 65 min: Kovacic limps off and is replaced by Ross Barkley. 63 min: Jorginho is booked for his part in a melee prompted by City’s failure to put the ball out of play so Mateo Kovacic could receive treatment for an injury. There’s no reason why they should have put the ball out of play - it’s up to the ref to stop play. 62 min: Pedro shoots low, hard and straight at Ederson. 60 min: Sterling, who is getting dog’s abuse from the crowd, curls a cross through the Chelsea penalty area from the left touchline. Kepa ushers it out of play.58 min: Hazard gets on the ball in midfield and pings the ball wide to Pedro on the right touchline. A promising move breaks down when Azpilicueta makes a dog’s breakfast of his cross into the City penalty area. 56 min: Hazard is penalised for handball under pressure from Stones, giving City a free-kick from about 30 yards out, left of centre. Kyle Walker curls the ball goalwards with his right foot and his effort is on target, but Kepa saves with a minimum of fuss.55 min: Raheem Sterling tries to jink his way in from the left and wins a corner when Azpilicueta gets in his way. Sterling takes the corner, but fails to clear the first man. Chelsea clear.54 min: Man City corner. David Silva whips the ball into the centre, where David Luiz clears before John Stones can get to the ball. 53 min: Pep rings the changes for City. Well, one change. Leroy Sane makes way for Gabriel Jesus and doesn’t look too happy about it. The substitute takes up position of the centre of City’s front three, Sterling moves to the left and Mahrez to the right. 52 min: Kante picks out Willian, unmarked in a good position after City’s defence had been stretched by a good run from Hazard. Willian shoots first time but doesn’t get any power on his shot. Ederson saves comfortably but City are in trouble here. 51 min: Chelsea apply more pressure, with Azpilicueta playing a ball in over the top. John Stones is forced to block Pedro’s shot. Man City are wobbling under a lot of pressure here.50 min: Riyad Mahrez is penalised for a foul on David Luiz and throws his arms in the air in frustration. Chelsea are looking very comfortable in these early stages of the second half.49 min: Close! But no cigar for Willian. He steps up and shoots, but Ederson is able to save. Pedro skies the follow-up from an offside position and City clear their lines. 48 min: Fernandinho brings down Willian to give Chelsea a free-kick about 25 yards from the City goal, straight in front of the target.47 min: Chelsea ping the ball hither and yon inside their own half, enjoy an uncharacteristically long spell of possession. Another 42 minutes of that and they’ll be home and hosed. 46 min: Chelsea get the ball rolling for the second half, with a one-goal lead to protect. Pep emerged from the tunnel, sat in his dug-out seat, closed his eyes and took a long contemplative draught from his water-bottle as he wondered what it’s all about. For Chelsea, Ross Barkley has been sent out to warm up on the touchline. No changes in personnel on either side after the break.So, Man City trail: For all their tiki-taka fancy dannery, there’s a certain amusing irony to the fact that they were ostensibly undone by a dirty long ball over the top. Interestingly, on BT Sport, Steve McManaman had recommended that Chelsea try exactly that just moments before David Luiz opted to launch a long diagonal ball up the channel in the direction of Pedro.Peep! The players file off for their half-time brew and Pep Guardiola’s speech should make for interesting listening. His players have dominated without creating too many chances, only to be caught by a sucker punch delivered by N’Golo Kante just before the break. It’ll make for a fascinating second 45 minutes, that’s for sure. Don’t touch that dial. 45+1 min: Well, well, well. N’Golo smashes home the ball from about 12 yards out after getting on the end of a square ball from Eden Hazard. Chelsea’s attack began with a complete change of tack that caught City by surprise. David Luiz launched a long diagonal towards Pedro in the City left-back area of the field. He played the ball to Willian, who was forced wide and gave the ball to Hazard. With a shimmy, he found a yard and teed up Kante. The finish was emphatic. Chelsea lead! Totally against the run of play, Chelsea take the lead courtesy of an n’goal from N’Golo Kante.43 min: Now Alonso loses the ball in the Chelsea left-back position, with Mahrez and Sterling snapping around his heels like a pair of angry terriers. Throw-in for City.42 min: David Luiz gifts possession to Manchester City with a loose, casual clearance, but gets away with it when Chelsea win the ball back.40 min: Man City continue to dominate, but haven’t yet scored. They were really turning the screw, but that break for the injury to David Luiz seems to have halted their momentum. 38 min: The ball goes out of play for a City corner and Raheem Sterling goers to retrieve it. Behind the advertising hoarding, several snarling Chelsea fans - grown, middle-aged men - scream abuse at him, their faces contorted with fury.“They’re wishing him a happy birthday,” quips Steve McManaman, on co-comms for BT Sport. Sterling is 24 years old today and already appears to have achieved considerably more in life than his comparatively elderly chums in the stands. 37 min: David Luiz gets to his feet, looking very uncomfortable and holding his lower back. On the sideline, Andreas Christensen eventually deigns to leave the bench and begin his warm-up. 35 min: Azpilicueta it was, who took one for the team, flinging himself in front of Sane’s shot when a goal looked on the cards. There’s a break in play as David Luiz receives treatment from the Chelsea medics.33 min: Chance! Sane has a shot blocked after Sterling had picked him out with a pull-back. Sterling performed a little twirl on the byline to take the ball past Alonso and leave the Spaniard trailing in his wake and looking a little foolish. 32 min: In the Chelsea penalty area adjacent to one the uprights with the ball at his feet, Sane is unable to get a shot away before he’s crowded off the ball.29 min: Pressing Chelsea’s defenders, Manchester City force Kepa to boot the ball long to increase their chances of winning it back at the first time of asking. He does exactly that, aiming for Hazard, who does well to win it considering his lack of inches compared to those in shirts of a lighter blue surrounding him. Chelsea are really struggling to get any momentum going here, as they’re unable to pass more than three or four passes together without losing the ball.28 min: Nothing comes of the corner and before too long, the balls travelled the length of the pitch and is back at the feet of Ederson. 27 min: Mahrez plays a cross-field pass to Sane on the left flank. He forces a corner out of Azpilicueta, who stays on his feet and robs the German of possession.

Messi’s free-kick, Messi’s skill and pass into Dembele and then that goal by Suarez. As for Barca, they’re heading three points clear at the top without playing particularly well as a collective.Game, set, match and derbi. Eyol haven’t even been that bad, no way do they deserve a 3-0 deficit but that’s what they have, and it’s probably only to get worse. Dembele played a lovely pass down the left channel for Suarez to scamper onto, David Lopez looked to have it covered but was bullied off the ball and the Uruguayan advanced, albeit at a really tight angle. However, somehow he squeezed a finish under Diego Lopez, who probably should have done better. Half-time and expect Valverde to make some changes ahead of Tottenham.41 min: Chance for Eyol! Didac Vila darts to the byline and does well to stand up a cross to the far post where Hernan Perez isolates Jordi Alba. The Eyol winger has the leap on the Barca full-back but can’t direct his header goalwards. A good opportunity.Henry Carter emails in. “All this from the fifth best player in the world!!”. Here’s the second goal. Keep your eyes on Messi. Stupid stuff. 37 min: Messi hits the post! Somehow Eyol survive. Rakitic wins the ball, feeds Dembele down the left. His cross is flicked into Suarez whose downwards header is well-saved by Diego Lopez but the parry is straight at an unmarked Messi, yet somehow the Argentine misses, heading against the woodwork.36 min: Suarez hits the post! The Uruguayan plays a pass into Messi and, honestly, the weight of the return, hit first time, is just absolutely perfect. Suarez swings his right boot, makes connection, it drifts past Diego Lopez but kisses the front of the post. 35 min: Borja then clips a pass over Pique intended for Hernan Perez but Ter Stegen gathers just in time. Barca strangely passive at the moment. 33 min: Eyol having some possession in the final third and they win another corner as Jordi Alba slightly rashly puts it out when he had time to do something else. Barca don’t defend the crossed ball particularly convincingly.32 min: Chance for Eyol! After a second corner is put out again at the near post, Sanchez has a third set-piece. That was half-cleared but then the midfielder recovered possession and launched a deep cross for Duarte lurking at the far post. The Costa Rican’s header was clean but was straight at Ter Stegen. 31 min: Bit of a mess at the near post as Victor Sanchez swings it in, intended for Perez, and a mass of bodies force it out for another corner. 31 min: Eyol have a corner as Marc Roca tries a clever inside pass and Semedo stretches his neck to prevent Iglesias running onto the ball. Here’s the opening goal for you28 min: Darder blasts one over from distance. He looks frustrated. And so he should be. 2-0 down and with a defensive gameplan. What next? A truly brilliant finish by Dembele. The French winger received the ball on the corner of the penalty area, cut inside and then curled a finish with his right foot over Diego Lopez BUT, and this will be all over Twitter soon enough, Messi in the buildup ... alien-levels of skill. He shimmied from one foot to the next, was fouled, kept the ball while on the floor, turned and then played a pass into Dembele. 24 min: Messi continuing to drop really deep, turning and then putting Barca back on the front foot. Suarez had a sight of goal but couldn’t get the ball out of his feet. Melendo then broke and had Hernan Perez to his right, as he drew in two Barca defenders, but didn’t see him and instead went square to his left and the visitors regrouped. 21 min: Chance for Suarez! Messi drifted across the 18-yard box, after Busquets had won possession, and stretched a pass into Suarez who took it first time with his left foot but Diego Lopez got down to save. 20 min: That was Messi’s 22nd derby goal. He already held the record. He has also now matched Xavi in terms of appearances in this fixture with 32. Well, that was good. Messi earned the free-kick, slipping into midfield and drawing the foul. He then just twists it right into the top corner from 30ish yards. Diego Lopez gets a faint touch but it’s so precise, he can’t keep it out. 15 min: Case in point there. Semedo’s cross was cleared, Busquets miscontrolled and Melendo had space to run at the Barca defence. He was squeezed out, and maybe even fouled, but the threat is there. Meanwhile, Messi has a free-kick, 30 yards out. 14 min: Semedo is playing virtually as an auxiliary right-winger, which is completely understandable but given Eyol are set up to flood the midfield, win the ball and counter at pace, with Hernan Perez particularly vital, it *could* spell trouble.12 min: Messi comes deep, turns on the afterburners to skip past two defenders and then pops a pass into the path of Semedo whose cutback is put out for a corner by David Lopez. Nothing comes of the set-piece. 9 min: First chance of the game! A wonderful counter by Eyol ends with a mis-kick from Iglesias but that was great. Victor Sanchez and Roca with some flicks and one-touch passing, Hernan Perez breaking down the right and a quick ball into the channel to Iglesias who was 1v1 with Pique but his shot was well wide. So wide, in fact, it wasn’t really a shot.7 min: Some good pressing from Eyol has Pique penned in and his rushed clearance is picked up by Darder but the midfielder gives it away to Dembele and Barca are able to break. Messi, however, finds himself crowded out and Didac Vila gets back goalside to get a toe in and prevent the Argentine from finding space to shoot.5 min: Interesting to see Dembele dropping deep, happy to receive the ball and play a simple pass in return rather than sticking out on the touchline and waiting for the ball to come to him. Hernan Perez swings in a cross for the hosts but Pique comfortably clears. Marc Roca then does exceptionally well in tackling Dembele on the counter. 3 min: Dembele does some smart defensive work to deny Eyol and Barca build again from the back. Pique jeered, as it standard wherever he plays outside of the Camp Nou.1 min: Barca kick-off and maintain possession. Lots of touches for everyone with Eyol appear locked in a 4-1-4-1 formation off the ball. Midfielder Victor Sanchez wins the ball inside his own half and is fouled by Nelson Semedo.The players are in the tunnel, lots of civil handshakes and hugs, Barcelona are in a dodgy pink kit, there is a light show going on inside the stadium ... kick-off is nigh.Villarreal have just lost 3-2 to Celta Vigo which leaves the league table looking like this...Meanwhile in the Bundesliga, Jadon Sancho just keeps on being ridiculous...Seeing as this a celebration of all things Barcelona, here’s one of the city’s finest...As for the coaches, Ernesto Valverde was talking up Eyol’s qualities yesterday...It’ll be an even derby. They’re in a good run of form and very strong at home, despite their recent results. For us, it’s a litmus test.This Eyol is different, but I can’t say they’re more dangerous than last season’s because we had two very difficult games at their place.We lost in the Copa and drew in the League, which ended up being a very tough match.It’s possible that Rubi has a Barca model. Rubi’s teams have always been characterised by building from the back and pressing high, but their strategy works well.They were more of a counterattacking team last season. They were more equipped defensively, but now they go looking for you, they want the ball and take more initiative.These players want to be the first to beat Barca at our stadium in the League. They’re up for the challenge. If we play like we did against Getafe, it’s going to be a very close Derbi and we’ll have chances of winning it. We have to exploit our style and give some surprises.We’ve strengthened many aspects of our defensive work in the last few days because we’ve conceded too many goals.We’re also in a phase where we’re not supporting Borja Iglesias enough. Our midfielders, wingers and forwards have to help because we can’t depend on the success of one player.Some goals to share with you from Atletico’s 3-0 win over Alaves earlier.So, for all that talking up of Mario Hermoso and this supposedly being an “audition” for a potential move to one of the big boys in January, the Eyol centre-back appears to be injured. Which is a shame. But, Piatti, Granero, Leo Baptistao .... that is a pretty strong bench, it has to be said.For Barcelona, Arturo Vidal has recovered from illness, Lenglet continues at centre-back while Arthur hasn’t made it in time after suffering, wait for it, “muscular overload” against Atletico. Ousmane Dembele – two assists and a goal from his last three appearances – starts on the right while Coutinho is on the bench against his former club. A sign, perhaps, that Valverde wants to keep Eyol at arm’s length.Pepe Reina, Viktor Onopko, Yordan Letchkov, Attilio Lombardo, Esteban Cambiasso (he eventually got his act together), Zinedine Zidane ... chances are if you were compiling a list of your all-time bald XI, Iván de la Peña would be battling away with Borja Valero for a place in central midfield. The reason the Little Buddha is of interest is because he scored both goals for Eyol the last time they beat Barcelona in La Liga, way back in February 2009. Since De la Peña’s double at the Camp Nou (and they did win 1-0 in the Copa del Rey in January this year, losing the second leg 2-0), Eyol’s record in La Liga against their city rivals reads: Played – 18, Lost – 14, Drawn – 4. Perhaps, most troubling, is the fact they have scored just five times in those 18 matches.It’s a period in time which has coincided with their move to the Cornellà-El Prat and their fans would dearly love to break this uncomfortable cycle. Traditionally, there’s been little cause for optimism the winless run won’t be continually extended but something feels different in 2018. Granted, they have lost their last three matches and their unbeaten home record this month but they have an excellent coach in Rubi, two of the most exciting young players in La Liga at present in centre-back Mario Hermoso (supposedly beloved of Real Madrid) and midfielder Marc Roca, a recent call-up to the Spain under-21 squad. Striker Borja Iglesias has eight goals in 14 games, with last week’s 3-0 defeat to Getafe breaking a sequence of five-straight scoring matches for the 25-year-old. If there ever was a time for Eyol to end this cursed run...As for Barcelona, Atlético Madrid’s 3-0 win over Alavés earlier in the day has the two Spanish giants locked on 28 points at the top while Sevilla messed up the chance to reclaim first, drawing 1-1 at Valencia. Ernesto Valverde’s side are far from perfect and have had their wobbles, most notably in defence with Samuel Umtiti’s continued absence due to a knee injury a concern which may prompt some transfer activity in January. But the defending champions just churn out the results, something that’s, of course, more than likely to happen with Lionel Messi - 21 goals and 10 assists in 26 games against Eyol - in your side.

Alli’s chance in the 45th minute was the best of the half, and Son’s brilliant goal came about half a minute later, the game cramming all its best first-half action into the final 90 seconds.Twelve seconds from the end of stoppage time, Spurs steal the lead in style! Son cuts in from the right and from 20 yards curls an absolute beauty into the far corner!45 mins: But Spurs nearly take the lead! Alli bursts through, and Morgan slides in at the last moment to steal the ball away.44 mins: Both sides continue to look unlikely to score, with both managers having some work to do at the break.40 mins: Spurs win a free kick, in a central location, perhaps 35 yards out. Son smacks it wildly wide.38 mins: Spurs break, with a long pass to Sissoko. He carries the ball down the right wing before cutting inside and waiting for assistance. Both Alli and Lucas Moura sprint 60 yards to provide it, running unmarked down the middle, and so Sissoko passes it straight to a defender.37 mins: Alli pushes the ball past Evans and throws himself to the ground on his way past. If there was contact, the referee didn’t see it.35 mins: Defences are doing a little bit too well, and there have so far been just two shots, with each team having one.32 mins: Spurs have continued to dominate, but in the last few minutes have been constantly pressuring the Leicester defence, which has so far remained impressively resolute.29 mins: Alli plays a one-two with Lucas Moura and skips past a defender, but Morgan appears in the nick of time to block his shot.28 mins: Barcelona, Tottenham’s opponents on Tuesday, are playing a derby at Eyol this evening. They currently lead 2-0, thanks to a masterful Messi free-kick and a second from Dembélé. 26 mins: Then Alli plays the ball to Son, whose first touch to send a ball that was behind him spinning perfectly into his path was delicious, but the linesman’s flag is raised.24 mins: Oh but that’s not bad! A long ball over the top finds Lucas Moura haring clear, and his first touch to control the ball is magnificent! His attempt to pull the ball back to Son, though, finds a defender.23 mins: Spurs have massively dominated possession over the last 10 minutes, though without doing anything very interesting with it.19 mins: Spurs press for a while, but Leicester do an excellent job of closing them down and holding their shape, and eventually force the visitors to turn back.16 mins: Mendy lands his studs on the back of Sissoko’s foot. The Spurs player goes down clutching the top of his calf, absolutely nowhere near the point of contact, and Mendy gets a booking.13 mins: It has been a promising start, and Leicester have had the best of it.10 mins: Chilwell escapes down the left, outpaces Aurier and pulls the ball back, but Vertonghen turns it behind with Iheanacho just behind him and waiting to pounce.9 mins: Dier slides in a little untidily, and though he gets heel on the ball he also tripped Iheanacho, and the referee thinks it’s worth a booking.7 mins: Now Ndidi makes a run from deep, savagely outpaces Vertonghen but then blasts a volley way high from just outside the area.6 mins: After a Spurs free kick is cleared Leicester break tidily, only for Ndidi to hit the ball against a Tottenham leg when a better pass would have sent Iheanacho clear.4 mins: Both teams try to play forwards in, but Maddison’s run is well tracked and Morgan sees off Lucas Moura.2 mins: Leicester burst forward, and Maddison plays the ball into the area for Iheanacho, but his attempt to turn back is stopped by Aurier.1 min: Peeeeeeep! Tottenham get the game started!Harry Kane has only missed six Premier League minutes so far this season. The last time he was left out of the starting XI was on April Fool’s Day, at Chelsea, and he started only three league games last season on the bench. Spurs won them all.The players are already on their way out!BT Sport still haven’t started concentrating on this game. Here’s a photo of some players warming up, just to prove that it happened:The final whistle goes at Stamford Bridge, and Manchester City are unbeaten no longer.With Chelsea apparently on their way to victory at home to Manchester City, Tottenham will start the game in fifth, and because of Chelsea’s superior goal difference will need a win to return to third.I’m forever ribbing Mrs B about the amount of footwear she takes on our occasional travels. Tottenham players though (assuming they didn’t arrive barefoot) need five pairs for an afternoon in Leicester, which leaves her very much in the shade.Mauricio Pochettino seems to have made a couple of big calls: Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen are only on the bench, saving their legs for Tuesday, and presumably will remain there if Spurs take control of the game in the first hour.Team news is in, and this is it:The third (domestically) televised Premier League game of an exhausting day of top-flight action comes from Leicester. Tottenham have won seven of their last eight games in all competitions, their only hiccup being the 4-2 derby savaging at Arsenal, but could be distracted by thoughts of the win-or-bust trip to Barcelona looming in midweek. Like their opponents Leicester have one defeat in their last eight games and that came at Arsenal, but though they are unbeaten in seven in all competitions five of those games have been drawn and only in one - the 2-0 victory over Watford in their last home game - has any side scored more than a single goal.Talking of goals, Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy scored three apiece in fixtures against each other last season but Vardy is out of this one with a groin problem. Team news to come imminently. In the meantime, welcome!

But it was when he discovered gong meditation sessions, otherwise known as sound baths, that he started transforming into the smiley, serene person he is today. He was so deeply affected by the practice that he ditched his singing and composing career, invested in some gongs of his own and embarked on a mission to pass on his newfound contentment to others. “I’m not saying I’m happy all the time,” he qualifies, “but I’m comfortable with life even when it’s really uncomfortable.”To find out exactly why banging a loud gong can have such a transformational effect on mind and body, I try out one of his sessions along with 20 other sound-bath novices. We gather on the top floor of a building near London Bridge with panoramic views of a sunset so dazzling it’s impossible not to sneak a phone snap, even though this feels unmindful and decidedly not in-the-moment. However, Cosendai remains characteristically nonjudgmental as he checks his three beautiful gongs are in order. Yoga mats are laid out with eye pillows placed at one end. Once we’re all reclined and quiet, the bright lights, noisy air conditioning and squeaky floor all feel amplified. Cosendai begins by listing these as things to simply notice and acknowledge, along with how our bodies feel on our mats, as he directs our awareness to the present moment.The sound bath itself is topped and tailed with Cosendai’s voice accompanied by the shruti box – often used to provide a drone sound in Indian classical music. His long, soft vocal tones meld into a spot of Mongolian overtone singing, in which he appears to sing two notes at the same time: a lower tone and a melodic whistle. However, the gongs are the main event, with a side order of conch shell for added ancient Tibetan vibrations. He weaves nimbly among us with his instruments to make sure we receive all sound frequencies from all directions and distances, creating added crescendos as he gets closer. The effect is a bizarre multi-layered wall of sound which, oddly, took me out of the city and made me feel as though I was in a cave.He bangs and rubs the gongs with big fluffy beaters, teasing out deep, reverberating, alien sounds that you feel in your bones. The overall effect is soothing, but it can sound eerie or dramatic at times, too. Like a really satisfying massage, some parts challenge your senses while others gently lull you into relaxation.While Cosendai says sound baths were developed by westerners in the mid 20th century, we have probably always used sound for therapeutic reasons. Although there have been no studies yet measuring the effects of sound baths on the brain, there are reams of neuroscientific literature on the effects of music per se.“It’s an ancient tradition to use sound to alter our state of consciousness,” says Elvira Brattico, Professor at the Center for Music in the Brain at Aarhus University in Denmark, who is planning to conduct the first scientific research into the effects of sound baths on the mind. “The shamans have done it with drumming,” she says, “and to use music as a medium to deepen a meditative state is quite common in different yoga practices.” But with gong meditation, sound is offered without the physical poses – you just lie on the matt and soak it up. A method that is keeping Cosendai very busy indeed.He is working seven days a week, from large one-off events (such as recent sessions at the Natural History Museum and London Fashion Week), to regular slots at yoga centres across London. His app Third Ear has 20,000 users and the audio book will be published early next year, recorded with “binaural” methods to render the sound in three dimensions. “Gongs produce a lot of harmonics,” says Cosendai, which is when we hear multiple tones in a single hit. “You get harmonics in everything, it’s just a question of how much of them you hear. While the piano sounds like one clear note to the human ear,” he says, “gongs are the number one harmonic-producing instruments. When you’ve got a lot of harmonics in the room, or on your headphones, they blend with each other, making baby frequencies if you like, and the more frequencies you have, the more your brain is activated in a different way.”With these different frequencies, he says, you hear what are called binaural beats, which is “when the brain receives information from two sound frequencies that are so close to one another, the brain brings them together and hears a beat”. The thronging effect of a bell or gong sound is produced by our brains.Brattico believes certain brain mechanisms observed in other music studies are also at play during gong meditations. One key effect, she says, is a process known as entrainment, whereby our brain waves synchronise with music. “Our neurons communicate with each other by oscillating,” says Brattico. “They fire rhythmically and there’s a particular frequency depending on how fast the oscillations are. The fastest oscillations are related to cognitive activity and motor activity, while slower ones are related to drowsiness and sleep and the deep sleep waves are very slow.” The low frequency of the gong sound, she says, may slow our neurons down towards the drowsiness and sleep zones.The rich soundscape of the wide harmonics, adds Brattico, can lead to a positive, relaxing experience, because “it allows you to detach from the cognitive part of the brain”. During Cosendai’s session, I become completely immersed to the point that the sounds seem to temporarily overrule my migraine, both distracting me and soothing me.The effect of the gong can create a strong emotional response, says Cosendai, and it’s not unusual for people to cry. Music certainly ignites introspection, says Brattico. “It activates a group of brain regions called the default mode network (DMN) which tends to be active when we’re not concentrating on anything and letting our minds wander.” The DMN is also connected to the reward system, allowing these self-referential thoughts, or even having a good cry, to become pleasurable experiences. This would explain why I don’t want the session to end it makes me feel good. “This combination of immersive and repetitive soundscape,” says Brattico, “might well trigger this experience of focussing on yourself. Having this in a very alert and active but relaxed state, detached from your worries and detractions, allows for a special meditative state.”On the surface, lying there and listening may seem more passive than other meditation practices, such as transcendental meditation, which involves repeating a mantra, or mindfulness, in which focussing on breathing is a key component. “A gong bath is a lot more free in that sense,” says Cosendai, “and that’s probably why the experiences, feelings and sensations people report vary”.While some of his clients tell Cosendai their bodies felt light, as though they were floating above the floor, for others the opposite was true, “So their bodies become heavy, almost as if they are part of the floor.” Either way, he says, gong baths shift our experience of space. “Typically the gong sounds can alter the spatial awareness of people,” he says, “which is really important, especially in cities where we’re so crowded.”One of the reasons Cosendai also uses his voice in his sessions is because, he says, “it brings a warmer more human element. The sounds can sometimes appear a bit eerie or unfathomable, maybe the voice before and after can really help. It’s a powerful instrument.”However, he says, the aim isn’t to merely bathe people in beautiful sounds. “It’s about what it does on the inside – what is revealed and what comes up and what you manage to feel, rather than having a sleep or feeling really relaxed. Otherwise, I’d send them to have a good back rub or something else.” He sees a sound bath as much more therapeutic. “This is why I’m doing it, he says. “It worked for me and I want to make sure it’s something available for people all over the world.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Burke, 45, is the Bronx-born senior director of Girls for Gender Equality, a lifelong educator and activist and, most recognisably, the founder of the MeToo movement which, 12 years before the alleged victims of Harvey Weinstein came forward, was set up to work with survivors of sexual trauma.McQueen is the English director of 12 Years A Slave, which won best picture at the 2014 Oscars, and most recently directed Widows, starring Viola Davis. The heist movie was in production in Chicago when the MeToo story broke and, says McQueen, cast and crew “talked and talked and talked. And listened and listened, more importantly for me. Stupid to say, but I was shocked.”Together, they discuss the astonishing testimonies unleashed by MeToo, as well as the backlash, and how Burke and McQueen would like to see the movement better served by the media, particularly the racial and class implications of who gets to be a “good” victim. They talk about their families’ roots in the West Indies and disagree, very mildly, on the place held by women within Black Lives Matter. Burke is passionate, ferocious, often very humorous about the contradictions and frailties of the MeToo movement, and the vision – developed over decades of unglamorous and largely unrecognised work – underpinning it. McQueen, meanwhile, is curious, soft-spoken and deferential to the expertise of the woman before him. It is a fascinating conversation.Steve McQueen Let’s just start! I think that what you’ve done has been extraordinarily influential. You’ve shifted everything, and people are thinking about things that happened to them in the past, and unearthing things that have been suppressed. It’s incredible.Tarana Burke Yes, and on both sides: I think survivors have suppressed things, and so have perpetrators, who now have a different understanding of consent.As a black person, I can’t be anything other than who I am, or be looked upon in other people’s gaze as who they think I am. But white women who come into this conversation, there’s an easy way out –TB OK, and you’re saying that versus –SM – I don’t want to mansplain, but as far as I see things with my mother and my sister, or my siblings, there’s a double –TB Oh, absolutely. I was talking the other day about a book called All The Women Are White, All The Blacks Are Men, But Some Of Us Are Brave.TB Right? And one of the things it deals with is the erasure, not just from the movement but in general, of black women, for whom there’s a choice: do I choose to be black first, or do I choose to be a woman? SM Wait, do you have to make a choice? Is there a choice?SM Do you think that? I don’t know if I agree.SM So, to go back to my convoluted question about white women coming into the debate?SM The irony is that the thing that made MeToo visible throughout the world was white women.TB And I have said publicly that I don’t have an issue with that.TB Right. I’ve been at this work, along with so many other women of colour, for years, and nothing that we could’ve done would’ve elevated this issue into the international spotlight.I’m a 45-year-old black woman from the Bronx who the media tries to ignore in some ways – who will acknowledge me as the person who “coined the phrase” MeToo, or as “the founder but not the leader”. They are constantly looking for other leadership.SM Yes, I’ve heard journalists say that, in MeToo and Time’s Up, there are no black leaders, and I’ve thought, what? Why is that?TB But regardless, they still will erase me. Due diligence in the media is to say “Alyssa Milano, the leader of the MeToo movement” and then in parentheses “original phrase coined by Tarana Burke in 2006”. And I don’t know how to say this without it sounding like “I should be the king” – I’m not saying that. I’m saying that, because of the investment in the work, there should at least be a conversation that says there’s a bigger vision.SM That’s why racism is so huge. It’s ginormous. That’s the thing that’s deafening.TB It’s the thread that runs through. Your narrative is being erased by these public perceptions set up by the media. There’s this real conundrum, of people who celebrate me as an inidual, but still won’t buy into what I’m saying because they’re inundated with headlines about who the MeToo movement’s going to take down next.SM When MeToo hit, we were in the middle of making Widows in Chicago and we just sat down and talked. I was shocked about certain things. I was like, really? Oh, wow.TB What’s interesting is that if we woke up tomorrow and 13 million people had a disease – because that’s what these people said, “Me too! I’ve got it, too!” – the whole world would stop. There would be three questions: how did we get here how do we stop it and how do we make sure it never happens again? Those three questions haven’t been answered in a year. It’s so commonplace that most of us don’t even think about it.SM That’s what shocked me, the normalisation of someone touching you inappropriately. It freaked me out a bit.SM Yes – well, I’ve had a partner for 23 years and we have two children.TB Did you talk to your wife about it?SM Yes I did, and she said some things I don’t want to talk about, that were very –SM Yes. Again, it’s heavy. I wish I could articulate it better, but I was also ashamed of myself, in a way – that I wasn’t sensitive enough to know about this. And maybe I’d normalised a certain behaviour. Not that I’d participated, but I never thought of it. I think what you did is wake a lot of people up to a certain pain that they had.TB In Widows, which I watched last night, there’s a scene where one of the women is regularly abused by her husband. And you see her with a black eye, and they’re sitting at breakfast, and he kind of plays around with her face and says, “Put some makeup on, that makes me uncomfortable.” And you’d think, when he died, she’d be like, “Yay!” And that’s not how it happens. She still has this loyalty to him. It’s nuanced. I thought that was a really interesting scene.SM I think there’s a kind of recklessness that comes after someone close to you has died. You realise your mortality – there’s a sort of liberation. That character, Alice, her mother hits her, too – and that’s conditioning.SM Interestingly enough, I’m from a West Indian family –TB Where are your family from?SM From Grenada and Trinidad.SM What’s interesting is that violence – I was beaten as a child –SM – it’s interesting how that violence is normalised.TB Things like: you don’t let anybody touch your private parts you don’t sit on a grown man’s lap. There’s a list I could run through. We all got that, and it’s an effort to keep your children safe. What happened in my case – I was six the first time – was that you have the rules, and the number one thing kids want to accomplish is not getting into trouble. We will do anything not to get in trouble.SM Right. You don’t want to get licked.TB So I have a question for you. One of the things I’m interested in is pop culture narratives around sexual violence, and the depiction of who gets to be a victim and who doesn’t. Do you feel a sense of responsibility? Do you feel a push‑pull around wanting to be a part of shifting the narrative and wanting to be super-authentic? Does that make sense?SM I think one wants to be part of shifting the narrative, absolutely. Somehow there’s got to be a way of imagining a situation where sex and the pleasures of sex are much more in balance, and much more enjoyable – where both people have equal engagement. I think that’s way more sexy.TB Yes, there’s ways to make consent sexy.SM The whole idea of men showing vulnerability is an issue. That has to be addressed – where it’s not a weakness, it’s a huge advantage. The dumbness about how this interaction has been popularised is absolutely crazy.TB To make male vulnerability sexy would be amazing. I have a friend in the BDSM world, and we had this really wonderful conversation once about what the world can learn from BDSM because it’s all based on consent.SM You’ve gone to the seed of the question. I think once people have an idea about how to talk about it, or popularise it, that’s when things will be dealt with. But it’s healing first. We can’t jump the gun.Same thing with race. Often I’ve said that, while sexual violence does not discriminate, our response is highly racial – around who gets to be a victim and who gets sympathy. We are all socialised to respond to the vulnerability of white women first. So you have the biggest names in Hollywood – they’re thin, beautiful, wealthy, glamorous white women, top of the food chain. We want to know everything about them what they eat, who they’re married to, so it’s no surprise that we’d want to know about this part of their lives that was broken, too.I definitely don’t blame them, they are also survivors. It’s not their fault the world responds to them that way. But they can also use that spotlight to amplify other folks who get less visibility.SM I just wish that could also be done racially.TB You mean, around sexual violence within race? Yes. That’s another layer to peel back. When Bill Cosby happened, there was an incredible backlash within the community. “These women are lying, he’s America’s dad,” all that. Every possible reason it wasn’t true. That was painful.TB It brought up this complicated conversation, because we know there’s a very real history of black men being falsely accused of sexual assault by white women. That’s not a debatable fact – we know it from Emmett Till. The other thing we know is that when any violence happens in a community, it’s at the hands mostly of the people in that community. So that means Asian men are raping Asian women white men are raping white women black men are raping black women. When it comes to black folks, because of that complicated history around false accusations, it becomes a shield not to deal with sexual violence at all.But what you said is right, we don’t want to take down our icons. We’re invested in their success in a way that is detrimental to our own.SM I understand it, in a way. But in order for us to grow, we have to deal with it.TB I don’t know what the solution is. If a group of black women actresses, or singers, came forward together, like with Weinstein, and said this thing happened – that would shift things so dramatically. They would still catch a hell of a backlash, more than white women. But I have based my work on the black women who did talk about their experiences. I would go into the classroom and say Mary J Blige, Queen Latifah, Oprah are all survivors of sexual violence, and they could connect to that.TB Like Ray Rice, the NFL player caught on video beating his wife. He knocked her out and dragged her out of the elevator. It was horrific. But then this thing happened where he became –TB – a monster. So your point about it coming back to race, it creates these dynamics where we’re conflicted.SM It comes back to the MeToo movement and how there’s a situation where some people don’t even know you exist. It does my head in. It all comes back to perception, to stereotypes.• This conversation appears in the ’s Weekend magazine and has been edited and abridged for length.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b836475f74780e2235a7ec2d914b9f51108ed846/0_643_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29b0df200698cb140404ec48d290f1c","title":"teenagers not alone sharing intimate stories stephen moss","story":"These students from Birmingham and Limerick have only just met. What did a weekend of sharing their most intimate stories teach them? In 2012, the Irish author Colum McCann and a group of fellow writers hit on an idea. They were at a festival in the US, and it started with a challenge they set themselves: “What is the highest aim of storytelling, and how can we harness that energy to transform our society?” They believed the stories they told had power – writers are not short of confidence – but could they change the world? McCann believed they could. Art for society’s sake.What emerged from that was an organisation called Narrative 4, which puts a story exchange between disparate, sometimes antagonistic groups at its heart. You pair up, swap stories from one another’s lives and then tell each other’s story back to the group in the first person. The theory is that telling someone else’s story will give you what McCann, who heads the organisation with co-founder Lisa Consiglio, calls “radical empathy”. For that moment, you become the other, possibly an “other” to whom you had previously been hostile.Narrative 4 is based in New York, where it has brokered meetings between schools with very different social mixes, and between pro- and anti-gun groups. In 2016 it moved into Ireland, setting up office in a disused library in Limerick. This is where, on a dry, bright weekend in the middle of November, 15 students from the Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, a school in the town that teaches all subjects in Irish, were introduced to 15 students from three schools in or near Birmingham: Holyhead in Handsworth Joseph Chamberlain sixth form college just south of the centre and Earls high school in Halesowen, a town to the west of the city.The weekend is coordinated by Ruth Gilligan, a novelist who was born in Dublin, lives in London and teaches creative writing at the University of Birmingham British author David Savill and Narrative 4’s regional director, James Lawlor, who keeps a gently watchful eye over proceedings. The theme is loosely “identity”, with Brexit as the inevitable background, but it quickly becomes apparent that teenagers live such intense, angsty lives that the tales they tell could go anywhere.That unpredictability is clear when the students are asked to write what they are curious about on a sheet of paper pinned to the wall. The organisers perhaps expect Anglo-Irish relations, Trump, nationalism – monochrome adult subjects. But the themes raised are truly technicolour: “Are there aliens?” “Is there a God?” “What happens after death?” “What language do people who are deaf since birth think in?” “Why doesn’t the hotel I’m staying in have Cadbury’s chocolate?” How can Brexit compete with these great existential questions?Gilligan and Savill explain to the group how to shape a story, and give them a quick guide to Irish and English history, and to some of the hostilities aroused by Brexit. But in the story-swap session, there are far deeper issues in play: loss, grief, the pressures put on teenagers, their urge to conform, the masks they have to wear to survive, their struggle to find themselves.They take the story exchange very seriously and respect each other completely, feeling the responsibility of telling their partner’s story. They then sit in a circle and tell their tales, one after another, with no applause or discussion until the end. It takes more than an hour, in which a lot of tears are shed, despite the competition from jolly seasonal music outside (it’s turning-on-the-Christmas-lights day in Limerick). Gilligan had supplied a small packet of tissues for the group I observe, but this turns into a packet-and-a-half session, surprising even her.It turns out that teenagers, on both sides of the Irish Sea, face many problems: there are stories of bullying, self-harm, eating disorders. The difficulties faced by the girls of Asian heritage in Birmingham, torn between a conservative community and a wider secular society, are the most severe. While the boys can lose themselves in sport, the girls experience the full force of cultural collision. The Limerick students, who are being taught in Irish and given a deep understanding of the country’s culture, seem more rooted, less challenged by conflicting identities, though still in some cases struggling with loss and questions of identity in the broadest sense. Who are they, why are they here, where does their Instagram self meet their real self?“It’s great to find you are not alone,” says one of the students, summing up the mood perfectly. “Life is unpredictable,” he adds – and at that moment, a drum roll suddenly booms out from the Christmas sound system in the street. Here are their conversations. Kishan Umesh Patel, 16, Holyhead school, Birmingham, and Emily Calton O’Keeffe, 16, Gaelcholáiste LuimnighEmily is a superconfident teenager who can’t stop laughing. She wants to be a pilot, and you can tell she’ll make it. Her story – about having an English mother and an Irish father, and being bullied at school because of it – touched on the key theme of the weekend: identity and the way you navigate it. “I struggle to fit in,” she tells me, “to find a place where I belong.”That gives her an immediate bond with Kishan, who was born in the UK to parents of Indian heritage. Both speak two languages: English and Irish in Emily’s case English and Gujarati in Kishan’s. Kishan opted for a jokey, sporty story about feeling cheated out of a trophy he thought his team deserved to win, but now says he wishes he’d been braver and told a more personal one. Perhaps about his religion and culture, which he fears are being chipped away. “I feel I’m British,” he says. “But I don’t want to forget that I’m Indian.”He says the weekend will leave its mark: “I thought it would just be like another school trip, but there was a lot more emotional depth.” In Emily, he has found an ideal match. “We talked for ages,” he says. “I think we talk fast.” “You find things in common,” Emily says. “But also things that were different,” Kishan adds. He means that growing up and going to school in Handsworth, a predominantly black and Asian area in north-west Birmingham, he didn’t have much trouble fitting in. As he talks, though, it emerges that he works at McDonald’s and customers regularly make racist remarks to him, which he never reports. “They’re usually drunk and I ignore them,” he explains, “or just don’t serve them.” Or spit in the burger, I suggest. Emily laughs again, pleased by the idea of revenge served with added relish.Emer Ryan, 15, Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, and Isobel Cooper, 15, Earls high school, HalesowenIsobel chose the only explicitly Brexit-related story of the weekend. “I’ve always been proud of being a citizen of Europe,” she says, “and I feel some people who are really small-minded have taken that away from me. I had no say in the matter, and my future is being decided by someone else.”Halesowen, the old industrial town in which she lives, voted to leave the EU. “There are a lot of older people there,” she says. “Not many young people. It’s quite a forgotten place in a way.” She says the sense of being ignored and left behind led to people scapegoating Europe. Her plan is to study German at university, and move to Germany if she can. One day she may even get her EU citizenship back. Inspired by her father’s interest, she says she loves Germanic culture and has enjoyed travelling there.Emer and Isobel clearly get on well – Emer already calls her new friend Izzy. “We found we could relate to each other,” Emer says of the story-swap group. “People go through things like loss and grief, and they all poured out.”“Going to school,” adds Isobel, “it’s easy to lose faith in your contemporaries and just think, ‘We have nothing linking us’, because some people aren’t very nice. There is so much ision between teenagers, between the different social groups. It was so nice to be in a room with people who didn’t care about all that, who were going to tell their story anyway.”Clementine Reed, 15, Earls high school, Halesowen, and Mercy Oweyo, 16, Gaelcholáiste LuimnighJust before the story-swap session, the participants were asked to write down something they were nervous about. Clem refused to write anything. “I’m not nervous,” she insisted. So it came as a surprise that her rendition of Mercy’s story was one of the weepiest of them all.At some point in the telling, the contrast between their stories struck Clem. Her tale, as told unflinchingly by Mercy, was of loving cricket from a very young age and excelling at it. Mercy’s story, as recounted by Clem, involved being born with brittle bone disease, feeling restricted and patronised all her life, having to use a wheelchair much of the time and then finding a voice, in every sense, when she started singing in a choir. Little wonder Clem found it so overwhelming.Born to a Nigerian mother who came to Ireland three years before she was born, Mercy speaks Yoruba to her mother, but has chosen to be educated in Irish. I ask whether she feels Irish or Nigerian. “Both,” she says, explaining that Ireland has been generally welcoming. She plans to go to university in Ireland and become a human rights lawyer.Clem says she’s enjoyed the weekend, but has never experienced anything quite as challenging. “Everyone else had been through a lot,” she says, “and I felt that I hadn’t really.” I assure her that’s a good thing – suffering is not a competition. But “When you meet people, you’re not aware of what they’ve been through,” she says. The amount of pain came as a shock to her the depth of her response to it, too.Danielle Hadnett, 15, Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, and Sameer Khan, 17, Holyhead school, BirminghamSameer’s story, as related by Danielle, was one of the most moving of all, and concerned the death of his elder brother in a road accident. “This is the story that defined my life,” Sameer said in the account he gave Danielle. Danielle’s was also a sad tale – about her grandfather’s death and the anxiety attacks that followed. But she had fought back. “I’m a soldier,” she said – or, rather, Sameer said for her – “and I will not give up.”Danielle and her sister are both at Limerick’s Irish school, even though her parents are non-Irish speakers. It makes for an intriguing home life – the sisters speaking to each other in Irish (sometimes useful, she says) and to their parents in English. Sameer’s parents are of Pakistani heritage, but his grandparents live in Russia and he was born in Holland. He grew up in Lowestoft and says he was the only “brown kid” in the class, picked on for his colour and because he couldn’t speak English. His family have lived in Birmingham since 2013. He seems relaxed and confident, and is perhaps a little overwhelming for Danielle, who has a natural quietness and reserve. But their battles unite them. “We are very different,” she says, “but also very alike.”Farzana Promi Ali, 18, Joseph Chamberlain sixth form college, Birmingham, and Muireann Ní Shé, 15, Gaelcholáiste LuimnighFarzana told the group, through her storyteller Muireann, that she had a tough time as an adolescent. She wanted to please her parents, her school, her friends. “I now know I’m never going to be perfect,” she says. “It’s been a struggle, but I’m getting through it. You have to find a balance. Over the years, I feel like I have found myself. I know what I like, I know what I don’t like, I know who I am.”She speaks Bengali at home. “Parts of me feel more British than Bengali,” she says, “but when I’m around my family, I feel more Bengali.” She was born in Bangladesh, but came to the UK when she was six months old and has spent all her life here.Muireann’s story was about being a fashion victim. She loves clothes, but disliked the way people were making her choose between fashion and study, as if a young woman couldn’t possibly be both fashion-conscious and academic. “There was pressure on me to be one or the other,” she says. “I wanted to be whatever I wanted to be, as many things as I wanted to be.”Her Irishness and the Irish language are at the heart of her identity. Unlike many at her school, hers is an Irish-speaking household. “I speak Irish to my father all the time,” she says. Her mother can speak Irish but less fluently, and Muireann usually speaks to her in English. And when they are all together? “It depends,” she says. “If we are in school mode, we will speak Irish.”Muireann’s grandfather passed Irish on to her father as his first language – hence his fluency – and she will continue the line. “By speaking it, we are keeping the language alive,” she says. “If we don’t speak it, it’s going to die. I’m a proud Irish person and it’s crucial to my identity. I will speak Irish to my own kids. I’m determined to do that. I’m going to keep it alive, even if it’s just for them.”Aaron O’Sullivan Riordan, 16, Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, and Kadeja Tasnim, 17, Holyhead school, BirminghamAaron and Kadeja both conjured up powerful stories: his about being physically attacked by a boy who had once been his friend hers about having a sister who she discovered, at the age of eight, was really her cousin.“Being attacked was an important part of my life,” Aaron says. “Coming out of it made me a stronger person.” It was never clear why his friend attacked him – it may have been some sort of gang initiation, a demonstration of newfound toughness. “I was very confused about why he did it.” Kadeja says she found telling Aaron’s story very affecting. “I don’t even remember reading it or saying the words,” she says. “I just became him and I felt really emotional.” Her own story was equally strong. “I chose it because it’s about thinking you are someone, then losing your identity and trying to recover from it. You start questioning a lot of things and get confused.”Confusion is the lot of the teenager. “You are trying to find yourself, you put pressure on yourself, but then there is pressure in external places,” Kadeja says. She wants to be a writer her ambitious, Bangladeshi-born parents want her to be a doctor. Her father is a taxi driver and is determined to see his daughter rise in the world. I ask her who will win the occupational battle. “I will,” she says.Aaron and Kadeja have an easy rapport. Kadeja says she has come to embrace her Bangladeshi heritage as she’s got older, while Aaron is proud of his Irish identity. “People from other countries tend to see the Irish stereotype,” he complains. “We’re all alcoholics, ginger hair, leprechauns – and that’s irritating at times. It’s how Americans view us.” There is some truth to every stereotype, he says, but there are more interesting stories about modern Ireland lurking under the Blarney Stone.Eva McMahon, 15, Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, and Hadiqa Ali, 17, Holyhead School, Birmingham“I thought it would be awkward,” Hadiqa says when I ask what she expected of the weekend. “But as soon as we started talking, it was OK.” Her story was a powerful one – of being criticised when she returned to visit her extended family in Pakistan for not wearing the hijab, and then labelled a hypocrite for wearing it when she came back to Birmingham. She felt she just couldn’t win.Eva says Hadiqa is “one of first Muslim people I’ve spoken to – it’s been a great learning experience for me. As I told her story, I became very emotional.”Hadiqa also had a learning experience. Eva’s story had been about Limerick winning the all-Ireland hurling tournament this year – for the first time since 1973. Hurling is a religion in Limerick – there is a statue of two hurlers in the high street – and this was a very big deal. It was even bigger for Eva, because her mother – a fan of the sport – was born in 1973 and has been waiting for this triumph all her life. Eva had shown Hadiqa a hurling DVD, and I ask Hadiqa if she now understands the sport and its quasi-religious status in this small, tightly-knit community. She rolls her eyes and looked perplexed. There are some gulfs that can’t be bridged.Simrat Kaur Bahra, 18, Holyhead School, Birmingham, and Marcus Cropper, 15, Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh“I’ve really enjoyed it,” says Marcus when I ask what he’s made of meeting the group from the Midlands, before wondering why he’s used a Northern Irish accent to answer my question. He is the group’s comic surrealist his story concerned a terrible year he’d had in which he developed a Nicolas Cage obsession to steer him through. He is one of only two boys among the 15-strong contingent from Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh. He reckons all the other boys at the school are spending the weekend obsessing about sport. In Marcus’s world, sport comes a distant second to box sets, preferably starring Nicholas Cage.Simrat is from an Indian background, is a practising Sikh and chooses to wear a turban. “It used to be that only men could wear it,” she says, “but women can wear it as well now. That’s a breakthrough in terms of our cultural tradition we’ve struck a blow for equality.”She is living proof that you can be true to your traditional religion and a representative of radical change. “I wear it to show that I’m not afraid of my background and where my parents are from,” she says. “I’m proud of it and it’s part of me.” She says she has occasionally experienced racism, but ignores it. “My faith is bigger than their derogatory comments.”Her story, as told by an emotionally charged Marcus, is about an upset within the family that led to a relative being bullied. Simrat found it hard to deal with and initially raged at God, but gradually made peace with her religion.She says she found the story exchange “profound”. “I learned a lot about people,” she says, “and about empathy. I see no difference between English teenagers and Irish teenagers. We all go through the same struggle.”• Commenting on this piece?

But it could be that I now know the meaning of shoe-leather journalism.The lesson came after being asked in the spring if I would join an annual data project the  has been conducting over the past few years – a freedom of information trawl of local authorities in England and Wales to collate all housing act prosecutions of landlords and agents during the previous 12 months.This exercise has always produced excellent stories that expose rogue operators who have been convicted time and again. But this year the idea was to go further than reporting the data. We wanted the stories of the tenants, as well the convictions of the landlords, and an understanding of how many of the rogue names kept cropping up, year after year.The effort meant that in October, as part of our series investigating rogue landlords, we were able to reveal how convicted landlords, who have been ruled unfit to rent out their properties, are continuing to operate by exploiting loopholes in the law that is supposed to protect the most vulnerable tenants.Getting to that stage meant spending much of the summer pounding the streets of various areas of the country. If the data project is clearly desk-based, it is equally obvious that to find out if there are people renting a rogue landlord’s property, you have to get out.I drove to Rotherham to knock on two doors – only to be told on each occasion I was months too late: the rogue agent, who had previously been managing the properties, had moved on.There were addresses in Birkenhead and Shirebrook where, having arrived, I could get no answer at any of the homes at all. And – most frustratingly – a property in Brent, north London, where I was so desperate to speak to the tenants that my log records 14 unsuccessful visits. (I eventually made contact via telephone, and the residents were not all that keen to play ball.)Even when folk answered the door, you were not guaranteed a story, or even a conversation. Very few tenants would be brave enough to go on the record – landlords can evict without giving a reason. The renters often seemed to fear that I might not be who I claimed and, let’s be honest, they almost always would have had more pressing things to do with their time, like fixing the kids’ tea.That’s all fine, of course, it is part of the job and the effort achieved some swift results. Theresa May pledged to give tenants access to the government’s new rogue landlord database after the investigation revealed that not a single name had been entered into the system in more than six months since its launch – and that even when landlords’ names were listed, the public would not be allowed to see them.Meanwhile, as part of a Labour consultation on the private rented sector, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, came out in support of a national licensing scheme, “in order to make regulation consistent for all landlords across the country and to stop the rogues from switching local authorities”.But while that appeared positive, what irritated was how often those you might expect to help the media seemed determined to frustrate.Council press officers love trotting out the soundbite about how they have “a zero tolerance of rogue landlords”, but then plenty refuse to assist newspapers looking to highlight the issue and what appear to be their triumphs.There were numerous boroughs that took months to be persuaded just to share court documents on landlords they had announced they had successfully prosecuted – whatever happened to open justice?. And then there was Westminster city council, which simply refused to help at all.In the end, the  had to go to court to gain information on a case that Westminster said it was proud of. A judge quickly ruled that all of the documents should be publicly available, leaving Westminster to argue it had only been trying to protect the anonymity of witnesses. Yet, most of the witnesses had previously been identified in open court.Apart from showing that Westminster had previously introduced homeless tenants to the defendant Katia Goremsandu – a woman now dubbed “Britain’s worst landlord” – the papers stated how she was statistically far worse than anybody without access to the evidence had previously known.Goremsandu has “at least 60 convictions” for housing offences – dwarfing the seven convictions in Haringey, north London, that led to her topping a list of landlords convicted for housing offences in 2014. The papers also gave clues to how housing prosecutions were enforced (or not) with the  able to use the documents to establish that Goremsandu, who has a multimillion-pound property portfolio and an estimated rental income of £188,000 a year, is paying off £100,000 of outstanding penalties at the rate of just £1,000 a month.So for all the cross-party support to crack down on rogue landlords, this project has left many involved with the feeling that the deck is stacked against tenants ever being consistently and properly heard - or the law being effectively enforced.As many housing law experts will tell you, the legislation is drafted in a way that is not necessarily that helpful to tenants, while the enforcement system exaggerates that issue further.Even then, if you are a journalist or campaigner with the luxury of the time to walk the streets and knock on the relevant doors, the bureaucracy slows you down further – and in some cases seems intent on stopping you.All of which gives the appearance of a system that can benefit the country’s rogue landlords. Well, rogue landlords and the nation’s cobblers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faac2655d5f2ebaee13498e4ac5d97eb5d8a3271/195_0_5326_3196/master/5326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7829af5b3f40cd52baab6a1bbf9c438b","title":"in the room for the brexit showdown","story":"In July, Nick de Bois found himself as chief of staff in the Brexit department after the sudden resignation of David Davis and the appointment of Dominic Raab.

This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.“The best deal we have is the one the prime minister’s put forward. Most of us are coalescing behind it in order to try and deliver on the outcome of the referendum, the withdrawal agreement, the political declaration. I think that is the best compromise,” she said.“What I’ve done is look ahead and seen that after that, if it doesn’t get through, anything could happen, there could be all sorts of alternatives that could be thrown up, which is one of the reasons we need to back the prime minister in the vote on Tuesday.”When pointed out that May has declared there to be only one plan, Rudd said: “She’s right, there is only one plan. It’s remarkable, I think, that she’s managed to deliver on a plan which delivers on the outcome of the referendum. that gives us the best in terms of keeping close to the economy and addresses people’s concerns, for instance, on fishery and immigration.“But, if that deal doesn’t get through, anything else could happen. There’s no other properly formed plan ready to take off the shelf and deal with. It could be chaotic after the withdrawal agreement, if it doesn’t get through. Lots of different factions are saying they don’t like it.“But there isn’t anything, I don’t believe, that is better. The withdrawal agreement is the best option and will allow us to have the orderly departure, kind of over a period rather than immediately, which was always how I thought we’d have to deliver Brexit.“But if it doesn’t get through, anything could happen: people’s vote, Norway-plus, any of these options could come forward. None of them are as good as the current arrangement we’ve got with the withdrawal agreement to vote on on Tuesday.”MPs are reportedly lining up to sack May if the deal fails but Rudd rejected the notion that May would have to resign if she lost the Commons vote and denied she had any leadership ambitions.“What would be a complete mistake would be to allow what is already an unstable period to descend into further instability with talk of a leadership challenge,” Rudd said.Asked if May stood down as prime minister whether she would make a leadership bid, Rudd replied: “There is no question of her going. We need a leader.”Rudd had told the Times that although she backed May’s deal, she believed the best plan B would be to switch to a so-called Norway-plus model. Although Norway is not a member of the EU, it is in the European Economic Area, meaning it is part of the single market.She said that “seems plausible not just in terms of the country but in terms of where the MPs are”, but added: “Nobody knows if it can be done.”Rudd also told the Times that if there was another referendum she would vote for the country to stay in the EU. “I’m not someone who has just changed my mind. If there was another referendum, I think we’re better off in,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9925de03c26714166724f814ac71bf705f33547/0_113_3949_2370/master/3949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f6964b9c551c01b7a45a91a026c8f9c","title":"brexit voters turning to remain such a mess buxton","story":"The clouds have briefly cleared in the Peak District and, from behind the counter at Appleyard’s tobacconist, Martin Olsson is greeting regular customers who are taking advantage of the good weather.He is helping run his wife’s family business in Buxton, where they moved in 2002. But the year he is reminiscing about now is 1994, when Sweden held its own in-out referendum on the EU. He voted no, but yes won by a sliver – so Sweden went in.“The country was ided and I was deeply disappointed. But a year later I began benefiting from membership of the EU, when I went to live and study in Ireland,” says Olsson, 47.He is holding out for a second Brexit referendum. “Over these past two years, a lot of people have realised that they have made the wrong choice, like I did. If Brexit goes ahead, ordinary people who are just about managing will be starving.”Just up the road Martin Lang, 61, works as a salesman at Conways DIY. He is of a different opinion. “I voted to leave in 2016 and would do the same today,” he says, “because of the amount of regulation we have to endure as a small business.” He is calling on MPs to back the prime minister’s deal. “Considering the opposition she has had from her own party, I think she has done remarkably well. I’m not a natural Tory voter, but I admire Theresa May.”Back on Buxton high street, Julie, 58, who works in retail and didn’t want to give her last name, says she voted to leave in 2016 because of the bureaucracy imposed by EU rules. “But if I had to vote again now, I would vote Remain, because it’s all been such a mess,” she says. Nicola Wallace, 24, who works at the University of Derby and has backed Remain from the start, agrees: “This whole process has been a disaster – and while the Brexiteers claim they can get a better deal, none of them are actually putting anything forward.”Other Labour MPs who have sought their constituents’ views include James Frith, Melanie Onn and Sharon Hodgson. All recorded recent net swings in their constituencies from Leave to Remain, as the reality of what the Brexit deal will look like has begun to set in.But, as the MPs acknowledge, voluntary surveys will tend to be filled in by the people who are most dissatisfied with the existing situation, and their findings are not representative. Onn says that “the vast majority of Grimsby residents still hold similar opinions as to when they voted in 2016. There has been very little shift and people’s patience is wearing thin.” National polling suggests that the results of another referendum would be too close to call. Despite this, senior Labour figures have set out a path towards endorsing a fresh vote on Brexit.If May’s deal is voted down on Tuesday – an outcome that seems inevitable – the party will seek to trigger a general election. If that attempt fails, Labour says it will call for a referendum on May’s deal. The question is whether enough Tory MPs will vote in favour of that.Back in Buxton, Sam Bastable, 34, sells his woodcraft designs at a stall inside the shopping centre. A Labour supporter, he backed Brexit in 2016, but if it came to a second referendum he is not sure which way he would vote. He supports freedom of movement and thinks May has negotiated a terrible deal. “It’s worse than what we have now,” he says. “I’m still in two minds about it all – because this is not the Brexit I voted for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb3eb71c501f083d19eed8b5514aa148f2e46e53/34_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5247bd509fd93f163fe596832f6621ef","title":"sounds of mars wind captured by nasas insight lander","story":"The sound of the wind on Mars has been captured for the first time by Nasa’s InSight lander, which touched down on the red planet 10 days ago.The agency’s jet propulsion laboratory (JPL) released audio clips of the alien wind on Friday evening. InSight collected the low-frequency rumblings during its first week of operations.The wind is estimated to be blowing at between 10 and 15mph. These are the first sounds from Mars that are detectable by human ears, according to the researchers.“Capturing this audio was an unplanned treat,” said Bruce Banerdt, the InSight principal investigator at Nasa’s lab in Pasadena, California. “But one of the things our mission is dedicated to is measuring motion on Mars and naturally that includes motion caused by sound waves.”Nasa presented the sounds at a news conference on Friday. Cornell University’s Don Banfield told reporters they reminded him of “sitting outside on a windy summer afternoon ... in some sense, this is what it would sound like if you were sitting on the InSight lander on Mars”.Scientists involved in the project said the sound has an otherworldly quality. Thomas Pike of Imperial College London said the rumbling was “rather different to anything that we’ve experienced on Earth, and I think it just gives us another way of thinking about how far away we are getting these signals”.The noise is of the wind blowing against InSight’s solar panels and the resulting vibration of the entire spacecraft. The sounds were recorded by an air pressure sensor inside the lander that is part of a weather station, as well as the seismometer on the deck of the spacecraft.The low frequencies are a result of Mars’ very thin air density, which is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide, and, even more so, the seismometer itself, which is meant to detect underground seismic waves that are well below the threshold of human hearing. The seismometer will be moved to the Martian surface in the coming weeks. Until then, the team plans to record more wind noise.The 1976 Viking landers on Mars picked up spacecraft shaking caused by wind, but it would be a stretch to consider it sound, said Banerdt.InSight landed on Mars on 26 November. “We’re all still on a high from the landing last week ... and here we are less than two weeks after landing, and we’ve already got some amazing new science,” said Nasa’s Lori Glaze, the acting director of planetary science. “It’s cool, it’s fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85bc3f7013fbbaa0125d031878747bee96fe9356/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9d3e92854922b2f685ddf8b18fc8761","title":"peter hotez vaccines did not cause rachels autism india interview","story":"The American scientist, whose new book explains why vaccines didn’t cause his daughter’s autism, on why conspiracy theorists need to be challengedPeter Hotez is dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. He has worked on developing vaccines for hookworm and schistosomiasis, and is a vocal opponent of the anti-vaccine movement. His daughter Rachel is autistic and he has written a book, Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism, in which he describes her illness and tackles the newly resurgent anti-vaccine movement.Why did you decide to write this book through the prism of your own child?Well, I felt called to do it. I’ve written books about neglected tropical diseases, and here I was seeing these terrible things happening in Europe and the US, and if I didn’t do it – a vaccine scientist, paediatrician and autism dad – who else would?Cases of measles reached a 13-year high in 2008. What’s the situation today?I can bring up the numbers of the European centres for disease control. You have around 50,000 cases of measles in Europe in 2018. So it’s very concerning. There have been 1,019 cases in the UK between October 2017 and September 2018.Is there an established mortality rate for measles?There is, but it varies depending on underlying nutrition. But remember, it’s not just mortality there’s also permanent injury due to measles encephalitis, measles pneumonia, hearing loss, affected vision… The overall picture of measles goes beyond the fact that children can die.Thimerosal, a preservative with a tiny amount of mercury, has been removed from child and baby vaccines in the US and the UK, although there is no evidence supporting a link to autism…After the Wakefield paper was retracted, the new allegation that popped up came from Robert F Kennedy Jnr and others, claiming that it was the thimerosal. But it was removed from childhood vaccines and the rates of autism did not decline. There are also large-scale epidemiological studies showing that there’s no link between autism and thimerosal. What the anti-vaccine movement does is play this game of whack a mole: you knock one down and a new one pops up. It shifts from MMR to thimerosal to spacing vaccines too close together, to aluminium in vaccines, and it’s all garbage. None of those things cause autism. We’ve learned a lot about the neurobiology and genetics of autism to know that this is beginning prenatally, well before children ever see vaccines.So what does cause autism?There was a paper released just last week in bioRxiv identifying 99 genes associated with autism. Autism has a very strong genetic basis, which is not to say that there is no environmental impact, because we still have this phenomenon of epigenetics but if there is any environmental trigger it’s happening very early on in pregnancy, around the time of conception. This is not something that’s happening after children are born. These genes involved in creating autism are causing very complex rearrangements of the anatomy of the brain. The idea that a vaccine would do that is really just absurd.Is autism growing?The problem is that the diagnostic criteria for autism also shift. And then you have the added complexity that, often, for children to get special services from the school system they have to have the autism label. What used to be diagnosed as all sorts of things back in the 60s and 70s is now labelled as autism. The numbers are going to go up a lot more, because we’re getting much better at diagnosing girls and women with autism. We used to say it was 10:1 boys to girls, but now we’re recognising that many girls and women are on the autism spectrum but often it’s more subtle, because they’re more socially adept they can camouflage their autism better. But they have very high rates of co-morbidities like OCD or ADHD, or even eating disorders. A lot of girls with eating disorders may in fact be on the autism spectrum.Wakefield has relocated to Austin, Texas and there has been a drop in vaccination rates in Texas. Are those facts in any way related?It’s hard to know. Certainly this terrible false documentary that he’s been involved with – Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe – hasn’t helped. How much Wakefield is a factor is difficult to estimate, because it’s grown so much bigger than Wakefield. We now in Texas have a whole political action committee (PAC) that’s anti-vaccine and raising money for candidates to run on anti-vaccine platforms. It’s happened in multiple states in the US. There are more than 480 websites that are anti-vaccine.There is evidence to suggest that it’s educated people who are leading this movement.As I like to say, educated enough to do a Google search, not quite educated enough to know what the hell they’re Googling.What’s driving it?That’s the most important question, and it’s one I can’t answer. There’s a lot of money behind this. Who’s paying for all this? It takes a lot of money to make PACs effective and put up all these anti-vaccine legislators.Is there evidence that the anti-vaccine movement is targeting vulnerable communities?Well, certainly we saw this in Minnesota last year, where they were absolutely predatory on the Somali immigrant community. They convinced them that vaccines cause autism and caused a horrific epidemic of measles.You suggest that the anti-vaccine movement is undermining care for autism. How does that work?One of the problems is that when the term autism is discussed in state legislatures in the US, and presumably in European parliaments, one of the first topics that then arises is vaccines. It distracts from the things we really need to focus on for kids and adults on the autism spectrum. Are they getting the special services they need? And then as adults, adequate job placements? Instead, the energy gets shifted to these false arguments about vaccines. So I think it’s been harmful to the autism community.You’re not sure whether Donald Trump has galvanised the anti-vaccine movement. But would you say he hasn’t supported the vaccination argument?He’s certainly not supported vaccinations, but in fairness to President Trump we didn’t get a lot out of the Obama administration and the Bush administration before that. Why have the US federal agencies been so silent about promoting vaccinations? I think when the anti-vaccination movement started in 1998 the federal agencies saw it as a cult movement and they thought it was best to ignore it. Unfortunately, they’ve largely continued that position even though the anti-vaccine movement is no longer fringe… it’s a full-blown movement affecting public health.How do you win an argument when empirical facts and scientific expertise are seen as inherently suspect by your opponents?There is a vacuum out there. While the anti-vaccine movement is very well-organised, well-funded, very adept at the use of the internet and social media, there has not been a response on the pro-vaccine side. So your question remains untested. I believe if there was a more active pro-vaccine lobby, most parents would listen to it. There are diehards who fully believe the conspiracy theory and you’re not going to reach those iniduals. But I think for the majority, you can reach them. That’s my motivation for writing the book.How do you see things developing with measles and other vaccines?Unless there is a well-focused and effective response, this thing is not going to get any better. All the signs are that it’s going to get worse. My big worry is that this is going global. The US and Europe are very good at exporting their culture, and now we’re exporting this garbage.

They succeeded in lowering the provinces’s standard, but could not stop it fluttering on a dank afternoon when defences prevailed.The Leinster supporters’ club intended to hand them out to members before kick-off. They would have been useful to shield their eyes after a first half that was a triumph for the conditions. Bath have been typical in recent weeks of the muddling mediocrity in the Premiership below the top two: as the weather has deteriorated, so have skill levels but here they worked to the advantage of Bath who from the outset played the role of underdog despite home advantage.Sam Underhill wasted no opportunity to leave his calling card on Jonathan Sexton, who more than once was slow to get up after a challenge. Bath, with another open-side flanker, Francois Louw, scavenged enthusiastically from the breakdown and they took the lead after forcing a turnover.Sexton had hit the post with a penalty after 10 minutes, but Leinster were looking slightly off the pace with most of their side having last played three weeks before. Bath hustled them and when Dan Leavy picked up from a scrum five metres from his own line at the start of the second quarter, he was tackled around his ankles by the scrum-half Will Chudley. As the No 8 fell to ground, he was overwhelmed by home forwards. Tom Dunn attacked a retreating defence as Bath exploited the turnover and two phases later the prop Henry Thomas was helped over the line.Leinster slowly regrouped and after Sexton’s break had been taken on by Garry Ringrose, started to exert control. Noel Reid’s chip into Bath’s 22 for Jordan Larmour was gathered by Joe Cokanasiga but as the England wing got to his feet he was snared by three opponents and conceded a penalty for holding on. Rhys Ruddock secured the resulting line-out and as Leinster got into gear for a drive to the line, the ball was smuggled back to Sean Cronin and the outcome was inevitable.Bath rushed up quickly on the flanks to force Leinster to cut back inside and they sniped effectively with Thomas making a telling burst. Sexton spoke to the referee a few times, but Leinster adapt to circumstance and after the sides were tied 7-7 at the interval, they took the lead for the first time with a fortuitous try nine minutes into the second period.Cronin’s throw into a line-out near halfway was taken by the wind and seized by Bath. James Wilson, playing at outside-half one week after signing to provide injury cover, tried to miss out two players with a 20m pass, as if assuming advantage was being played. It wasn’t and when Larmour seized the ball, he had too much of a lead for Cokanasiga to overhaul.“We got a bit lucky,” said the Leinster coach, Leo Cullen. “The line-out was crooked and it was a big moment in the game. It was a mixed performance and we have a lot to work on ahead of the return game on Saturday.”Bath kept slugging it out but desperation came into their play after Wilson missed a 40m penalty. Cokanasiga escaped without a card after clattering into Luke McGrath as he chased a kick, catching the scrum-half on the head as they both skidded on the saturated surface. The referee Mathieu Raynal decided that the contact, while high, was unavoidable.It was not Cokanasiga’s afternoon. As Bath attacked in Leinster’s 22 they lost the ball, not for the first time. James Lowe kicked long and chased hard, catching Cokanasiga and forcing a penalty out of the wing, who limped off one minute from time. Ross Byrne kicked the three points with Sexton, who later hobbled off with a calf strain, having treatment.It gave Leinster a cushion and while Bath secured the bonus point they merited with Wilson’s late penalty, had skill under pressure matched their effort, they would have had more. Anything other than a win in Dublin and they are out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef51b9fb91da149469c6453cec5883543322f998/0_178_5236_3142/master/5236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22b905a232c810198e363e8af876d8c9","title":"the observers best christmas shows of 2018","story":"From veteran dames to festive circus arts (and wicked queen Dawn French) the Observer’s critics pick your top ticketsJill Murphy’s stories have sold more than 5m copies worldwide and been made into numerous screen adaptations.

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3A decade ago, grabbing a burger was a quick fix, something we did when we were short of cash, time or imagination. For modern diners, going for a burger is a quest. A quest for excellence: gastronomic, ethical and aesthetic excellence. In cities around the globe, dishes that would once have been termed fast food – pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches, tacos and hot dogs – are being taken as an art form, with fiercely loyal cult followings on social media and five-star newspaper reviews by food critics previously accustomed to starchy tablecloths and foamy, fiddly haute cuisine offerings. On Twitter and other social media platforms, diners furiously debate the merits of a Bleecker burger over a Patty \u0026amp Bun burger on the Mexican front, Breddos and DF Mexico vie for the crown of best tacos in London, and the gloves are off between devotees of Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.This is the golden age of flash food – poshed-up fast food – when the most sought-after meals around the UK are sophisticated versions of simple staples.“I think haute cuisine has been put in its place,” says chef Gizzi Erskine, author of Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over. “We now take comfort in simple dishes that mean something to us, that may have been pushed to another level from technique and ingredients. Plus, we care much more about the ingredients – provenance, breed and how things are farmed – so there’s a new understanding that a great piece of meat cooked simply is enough.”A menu is one of the most telling barometers of any society, indicating our shifting aspirations, economic circumstances, ethical and health preoccupations and how we choose to socialise. “This is definitely a sociological trend as much as about food tastes,” says Damien Gabet, editor of Square Meal magazine. “It’s no longer cool to shout about that Michelin-starred meal you ate off starched tablecloths, but there’s cultural capital to be gained from going out and Instagramming a meal from the most hyped food truck in town.”Social media has significantly fuelled the trend for superlative versions of simple dishes. “Fine-dining fare doesn’t actually photograph that well and generally looks fussy and drab,” says Gabet. “Whereas, dishes such as tacos and burgers have distinct outlines and vibrant colours.”In London, few figures have done more to champion affordable new restaurants, informal supper clubs and food trucks than Clerkenwell Boy, an anonymous food influencer with close to 200,000 followers on Instagram (@Clerkenwell_Boy). “I started Instagramming to try and make food more accessible and less elitist,” he says. “Because, while there is a place for special-occasion fine-dining, on a Tuesday night with friends, we generally want affordable but delicious meals served family-style, in a no-frills setting but with relaxed and friendly service.”And while we might be dining out more, this doesn’t mean we’re lowering our standards. “If we go out for a burger, we want it to be the best burger in town,” says Clerkenwell Boy. “We want to eat simply, but we want it to be the absolute best version of that dish.”As Trish Caddy, Mintel’s senior foodservice analyst, puts it: “Millennials – the generation most likely to consider themselves as ‘foodies’ – have developed an acquired taste for artisanal flavours such as dry-aged meats and smoked cheese, partly out of a desire for visceral, intense experiences that stimulate their senses.”And although consumers are increasingly health-conscious, there’s also been a shift in what we consider an “unhealthy” meal. Burgers and pizzas are no longer demonised there’s a new understanding that excessive sugar, sweeteners, additives and heavy processing are the real culprits in poor health and obesity.“So, instead of eating low-quality processed meats such as fatty pepperoni and sausages, millennials are seeking out functional ingredients like fermented foods that tap into the ongoing gut-friendly food trend,” says Caddy. “For example, sourdough pizzas, which feature purported health benefits that come from the fermentation process, have a distinctive sourness compared to ordinary pizza bread dough. This suits millennials, who have grown accustomed to food with intensive flavours as well as health benefits.”And if diners are rediscovering simple pleasures, the good news is that these dishes are also immensely satisfying to prepare. “Cooking should be about everything from sourcing great ingredients to the therapeutic rituals of breaking down the recipes,” says Erskine. “And everyone should be able to eat, and cook, this way.”The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithVibrant, arty and home to one of London’s most erse communities, Peckham has cemented itself as a true cultural hotspot – with creative hub Peckham Levels, the legendary Bussey Building and no shortage of galleries and cafes just a few of its draws. But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now. People do of course go on to club nights at the CLF Art Cafe – known locally as the Bussey Building (during the summer months there’s a rooftop bar and cinema), but I’m like an 80-year-old granny and just go home!Head to the only cinema worth knowing aboutOnce a month I take myself on an evening date to watch a film at Peckhamplex. I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape. There was more footage of me in my pram and walking through Peckham. There were green buses then – they were so cool – and the McDonalds is in shot, which is still there.Find some headspaceSexby Garden in Peckham Rye Park is my hideout, my reflection spot – my secret favourite place.

From rethinking your routine to noticing art and culture around you, as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, here are 10 ways to appreciate the magic of the everyday. All images captured on Google Pixel 3Most of us are settled into our routines. Wake up, check emails, grab a coffee, hop on the train, get to work. It’s not our fault, it’s the efficient way that our brains work. “Having this autopilot mode allows the conscious mind to be freed up for other tasks,” says Gemma Griffith, a director at the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at Bangor University.However, autopilot mode can have its downsides. By being so wedded to our ingrained habits and routine we can risk becoming disconnected from other people and our surroundings, and missing out on everyday magic. For Griffith the remedy is simple: “It’s about switching back to ‘being’ mode rather than ‘doing’ mode and focusing our attention on the present moment”. Here are 10 ways to shake up your routine and relish the everyday.Take time outYou don’t have to trek to the top of a mountain to find inner peace. Whether you’re on your commute or taking a lunchtime stroll, take the time to open up your awareness. “Focus on your walking, how your feet feel on the ground, the temperature of the weather at that moment, and the sounds you hear,” says Griffith. Coax your mind into the present moment by taking a different route home or trying out a new lunch spot.Be more basicFashion’s love affair with utilitarian dressing continues, with pared-back basics the lynchpins of Instagram’s most followed fashion icons. “The current appetite for streetwear and the rise of high-street stores that specialise in stocking classic key items, such as brands like Arket, prove that the trend for basics is going nowhere,” says stylist Laura Martin. The humble white t-shirt, the classic hoodie and ordinary gym trainers have never been more on trend. The good news is, they’re probably already in your wardrobe.Rethink your favourite foodsThe internet has turned eating into an art form. While home chefs could once have lived a lifetime using only Mrs Beeton’s Cookery Book for company, today we are googling ambitious dishes then feverishly photographing and hashtagging the results. But have we forgotten the simple pleasure of ordinary meals and ingredients? As the zeitgeist turns towards a balanced approach to eating, bloggers such as the Ugly Vegan are performing the seemingly revolutionary act of sharing unfiltered, familiar dishes. For your next evening in, why not grab a bag of imperfect veg and create something extraordinarily ordinary?Notice art around youYou don’t have to go to a gallery to appreciate great art and design: seek out signs of creativity all around you. If you’re in London, look up Art on the Underground’s Brixton mural map, leading to examples of street art in the area dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Manchester? Check out the street art tours on offer by writer Hayley Flynn, who set up bespoke tours of the city to put a spotlight on the local landscape of the Northern Quarter, which is packed with rich history. Over in Bristol, the tourist office has published free, downloadable walking tours of Banksy’s work.Discover hidden librariesFrom repurposed old red phone boxes to shelves at the train station, hidden libraries are popping up everywhere. The literary scheme Read Now, Write Now has teamed up to create book exchange shelves along the Wirral train line, and Clapham North tube station in London has a book swap shelf located at its entrance. Over in Crossmichael in southern Scotland and Amberley in Stroud, locals have turned their old phone boxes into mini libraries. The pleasure in these new makeshift lending libraries? “You get to discover new gems,” says Fruzsina Bekefi who runs a monthly book swap out of east London reading nook Libreria. “It’s a great way to widen my horizons and inject a bit of serendipity into my life.”Find a new perspective There are more than 4m posts for #lookup on Instagram and with good reason: from intricate architecture to stunning skies, there’s so much you could miss if you keep your eyes trained on the ground. And as we shuffle along our daily tramlines, our thinking can get stuck in a rut too. Head up a hillside or tall building for a fresh look at where you live, or mix up your commute by getting off a stop or two early and walking the rest of the way.Discover hidden historyWhether you are a fan of poets, musicians, athletes or writers, it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for the English Heritage blue plaque scheme. The plaques dotted around London point out where notable creatives lived in the city, from children’s author AA Milne to the black composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The English heritage scheme has also influenced other local areas across the UK to celebrate their histories, too – so look out for blue plaques in Brighton and Hove, South Tyneside and Leeds (thanks to the local Leeds Civic Trust).Shake up your workoutIf your idea of exercise is headphones and a running machine, why not break the habit and explore a more sociable way to exercise? GoodGym hosts running meet-ups across the UK, combining fitness with an activity that benefits the local community. Jog to meet an isolated elderly person, sort out cans at a food bank or pitch in to tidy someone’s garden. A recent study from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US proved that team exercise can lower stress and improve quality of life.Appreciate moreBusy doesn’t have to equal stress – it’s all about how you approach it, says Griffith. “Do a routine activity mindfully, whether that is brushing your teeth or eating breakfast in the morning, by adjusting your senses to what you are doing,” she says. The benefits of mindfulness are worth it. “It’s a practise that lowers the stress hormone cortisol. It encourages those who apply mindfulness to their daily lives to have more compassion for themselves and others,” says Griffith.Get back to natureGwyneth Paltrow’s love of grounding has been well documented (and much maligned), but how about a spot of forest bathing? This new nature buzzword refers to a rising trend in green spaces inspired by a Japanese tradition. Try it by heading to your local forest or woodland trail and soaking up everything you see, touch, hear and smell. Even if you can’t make it that far afield, swap that “al desko” lunch for some much needed vitamin D – it’s the perfect pick-me-up when daylight hours are in such short supply.The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

Chances of a rapprochement had appeared to be on the rise following a 90-day tariff truce agreed between the two countries at the recent G20 summit in Buenos Aires.Stock markets in the US, UK and Europe – already skittish during this parlous period for relations between the world’s two biggest economies – gyrated on Tuesday and Thursday as investors considered the possibility of a fresh tariff escalation undermining an already fragile global economy.While its finance director’s arrest has placed the company squarely at the centre of world affairs, Huawei is no stranger to being scrutinised with open distrust. It has been banned from involvement in the installation of 5G mobile networks in India, New Zealand and Australia, blocked from making acquisitions in the US and banned from selling phones on military bases by the Pentagon.There is no official prohibition in the UK, but BT has excluded Huawei telecoms infrastructure from its own 5G rollout and removed some of its equipment from the 4G network. Concerns about Huawei seem to emanate, at least in part, from the history of its 74-year-old founder, Ren , who has long had ties with both the People’s Liberation Army, where he served as an engineer, and the Communist party. Moreover, his company has grown into a globe-straddling colossus, the world’s largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, selling in 170 countries. It also overtook Apple earlier this year to become the world’s second-largest smartphone manufacturer behind Samsung, churning out 54m handsets in three months.But however great its success, Huawei has never been able to dispel the cloud of suspicion that hangs over both Ren and his creation. Given the volume of espionage and cyber-attacks that originate in China – targeting nations and companies alike – questions have inevitably been raised about the security implications of using Huawei’s technology.It is, after all, a company founded by a military tech expert. Concern has focused on whether Huawei’s kit could be used to spy on foreign competitors, steal intellectual property or even install “kill switches” in energy or industrial projects. Some analysts have warned that, in the event of a conflict, Beijing could exploit hidden backdoors in Huawei technology to shut down a foreign power’s infrastructure at the touch of a button.Ren himself has, in his relatively rare public appearances, sought to dismiss such concerns as scaremongering. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2015, he told an audience: “There’s no way we can possibly penetrate into other people’s systems and we have never received such a request from the Chinese government.”That, of course, is exactly what you’d expect a spy to say.But the real question isn’t so much whether Huawei is a covert espionage operation but whether it could be coerced into becoming one. For a start, Chinese companies – and Huawei is no exception – typically have a Communist party committee within their corporate architecture. What these committees do, or how much influence they wield, is hard to gauge.A new national intelligence law that came into force last year may be of even greater concern. Article seven of the law states: “All organisations and citizens shall, in accordance with the law, support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work, and guard the secrecy of national intelligence work they are aware of.“The state will protect iniduals and organisations that support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work.”Alarming conditions such as these lend some credence to Huawei’s bogeyman status among governments, even in the absence of any hard evidence to support their fears.Washington has long distrusted Huawei and the company’s plan to buy a stake in rival 3Com collapsed in 2008 in the face of political opposition.President Obama even defended the National Security Agency (NSA) hacking into its systems, citing national security concerns. And the US has not only banned the company from involvement in its own 5G networks but urged other countries to do the same.Huawei agreed to submit its technology for testing at a centre in Banbury, Oxfordshire, where officials from GCHQ run the rule over its products. Despite that, BT has excluded its equipment from its 5G plans and even removed some of it from existing 4G infrastructure.The two antipodean countries have both banned Huawei and rival ZTE from providing telecoms equipment for their 5G networks. The Australian ruling did not make reference to Huawei specifically but mentioned companies likely to be subject to directions from their domestic governments.In the world’s second-largest mobile market, Huawei was reportedly banned from participating in 5G, although it denied that this was the case and said it had been invited to test its equipment in 5G trials.Huawei is also said to be facing the prospect of restrictions in a host of other countries, including Italy, Japan, German and Canada.The company has gone to great lengths to address its image problem, hiring legions of PR advisers and allowing GCHQ to run the rule over its tech at a special centre in Banbury, Oxfordshire. The company even hired the British government’s former chief information officer John Suffolk as its global cyber-security officer.Suffolk himself has pointed out that any fears about Huawei ought to equally apply to any firm that has a role in projects of national significance. “Believe no one and check everything,” he told the Economist.Huawei’s problem appears to be that no matter how closely it is examined, the facts of its founder’s past – coupled with the global importance of telecoms – mean it can never be given the benefit of the doubt.According to Ren, the company’s name comes from a patriotic slogan that he saw on a wall one day: zhonghua youwei, or “China makes a difference”. Unfortunately for Huawei, that difference appears to be an aura of mistrust that is nigh-on impossible to escape.The arrest of Huawei’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou has thrown a new spotlight not only on the company but also on its founder: her father, Ren Zhengfei.Much of the doubt surrounding Huawei stems from Ren’s background in the People’s Liberation Army between 1974 and 1983, where he was an engineer.Ren’s rags-to-riches rise is part of Huawei’s official narrative. The 74-year-old grew up poor, the son of teachers in a remote mountainous town in the south-western province of Guizhou. He studied at the Chongqing Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture and later joined the military “by chance” in the 1970s, when fabric was being rationed and the government was recruiting anyone with a university education to help build equipment to produce synthetic fabric.After leaving the army, Ren landed in Shenzhen, designated a special economic zone as part of China’s transition to a market economy. He started Huawei with roughly £4,000 in capital from five investors and no obvious plan. “It was not as romantic as you imagine,” he has recalled. “Neither was it so wonderful.”In 2013, Ren said he had considered renaming his creation. “For many years there has been a debate in our company over whether we should change this name. Recently, we’ve decided not to change it. We are going to teach foreigners how to pronounce it, and not always say it like ‘Hawaii,’” he told the Beijing Times. For the uninitiated, Huawei is pronounced hoo-ah-way.As his company expanded to become China’s largest tech company by staff, employing more than 180,000 people, Ren maintained a low profile. The bulk of his international media appearances seem aimed at dispelling doubts about his or the company’s connection to the Chinese military.Yet Ren’s Communist party credentials continue to dog him. He has been a member since 1978, and was invited to attend its 12th national congress in 1982. For the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening-up this year, Ren was deemed one of 100 “excellent private entrepreneurs” who “firmly safeguard the leadership of the Chinese Communist party”. Critics also point to the company’s status as one of China’s “national champions” – companies whose global expansion is considered to be in the national interest.While Ren has repeatedly said none of his children will succeed him, Meng was seen as being groomed to be her father’s successor.Lily Kuo and Kate LyonsAdditional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

Becks is giving two votes to Stacey and Kevin and one to Ashley and Pasha. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - a total of 39 for Faye and Giovanni.Bruno uses ALL the metaphors, and it had the kind of musicality he rarely sees. Craig thought it had a clumsy moment, but Darcey loved the intense drama, and Giovanni gave her the freedom to express those lines. Shirley thought it was outstanding, and she is in love with Faye’s beautiful ankles and feet. Niche. Well, this is more like it. Faye is the sexiest purple Quality Street known to man or woman, and this is a nice effort. A few balance issues, but some nice flicky leg action, and Giovanni is doing a great job of showcasing Faye. Would have liked a bit more intensity and Argentine filth, but great work. And finally, it’s FAYE AND GIOVANNI! Their second dance is the Argentine Tango to ‘La Cumparsita’ by Machiko Ozawa. They’ve taken a huge risk this evening with two hugely complex dances, but hopefully they’ve put the effort into this one rather than the Samba earlier. Scores: 5,6,6,6 - a total of 23 for Lauren and AJ. Too many mistakes for Shirley too, there were lots of times when Lauren was on the wrong foot. Bruno really felt for Lauren, but she made it to the end. Craig thought it was a real shame, and sadly Lauren didn’t manage to cover it up by over-acting. Darcey agrees – this really wasn’t Lauren’s best night. So much beige in those outfits. This isn’t giving me much hope, to be honest. They are on a boat, but it definitely not rocking. In fact, it’s barely left port. Nice soft knees from Lauren, but it all feels a bit tentative and there are quite a few mistakes and timing issues. Not her greatest effort, sadly. Next up it’s LAUREN AND AJ! Their second dance is a Samba to ‘Rock The Boat’ by The Hues Corporation. I love this song, and have an inexplicable affection for the Samba, so very much hoping Lauren has downed three Caiprinhas and is ready to shake it.Scores: 10,10,10,10 - a perfect score for Ashley and Pasha.“I love Pasha, but he doesn’t believe in climate change”, says Becks.

The former British international development minister has been condemned on both sides of the Irish Sea for her remarks in the Times that Britain could prevent the use of its country as a landbridge between Ireland and the continent. She responded to a British government report stating that a no-deal Brexit might mean food shortages in Ireland. In such a scenario she suggested this possibility could be used to exert pressure on the Irish Government to drop its insistence on the backstop. “This paper appears to show the government were well aware Ireland will face significant issues in a no-deal scenario. Why hasn’t this point been pressed home during negotiations,” she told the Times in reference to the report.Ms Patel’s only comments since that report was a tweet where she declined to elaborate other than to state: “It is clear my comments on‘No Deal’ (sic) have been taken out of context by some. We should go back to Brussels \u0026amp get a better deal. There is still time. Let’s take back control of borders, laws \u0026amp money.” Many responses to her comments have referenced the Great Famine between 1845 and 1849. BBC journalist John Simpson tweeted: “If Priti Patel really did suggest that Britain should use the threat of food shortages to force Ireland to change its approach to Brexit, which I find hard to believe, then I’m more shocked than I can say. Have we learned nothing since the 1840s?”Labour MP David Lammy also referenced the Famine: “The starvation of innocent Irish men, women and children was one of the most shameful episodes in British colonial history. Priti Patel’s comments expose either extreme callousness or ignorance. Shame on her either way for throwing salt at old wounds.” Owen Smith, a former candidate for the leadership of the Labour Party, described her comments as inexcusable. “Ireland is our ally, friend and neighbour. To level this threat is as ignorant as it is reckless. I hope she reflects and retracts as soon as is possible. Her party leader should insist that she does.”Former BBC journalist Gavin Esler tweeted: “Truly despicable comments from Priti Patel – how is it possible that someone like this ended up in the British Cabinet?” Former SDLP leader Mark Durcan tweeted: “No, Priti, they weren’t taken out of context. What thought did you give to their content or context? Insulting people’s intelligence won’t redress or spin insults to identity \u0026amp interests. But thanks for exhibit proof of the need for backstop \u0026amp dangers with any parliamentary lock!” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s EU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald have been among those in Ireland who have criticised the former Tory minister’s remarks.

Photograph: Sean GallupGetty ImagesWhen Theresa May’s cabinet meets around the coffin-shaped table in Downing Street on Tuesday morning, chief whip Julian Smith will report on the likely outcome of that evening’s vote on the Brexit deal. Unless his success rate at persuading Brexiteer MPs to support the deal improves dramatically over the weekend, Smith will predict a crushing defeat for the prime minister.Already, a number of ministers are urging May to call off Tuesday evening’s vote, a view shared by Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee of backbenchers.“I think the most important thing is to have clarity about how we might remove ourselves from a backstop, Northern Ireland protocol situation if we were to enter into one in the future. It’s having the answer to that question of substance that is most important, not the timing,” he said.“So if that question can be answered in the course of the next few days, then all well and good. If it can’t then I certainly would welcome the vote being deferred until such time as we can answer that question.”Postponing the vote, which is scheduled for 7pm on Tuesday, is not straightforward and could itself require a vote for the House to adjourn. There is no reason to believe that the DUP, who wants May out of Downing Street, would make life easier for her by sparing her the humiliation of a defeat on her deal.Procedural ruses to avoid a vote, such as failing to move the motion at the start of the debate on Tuesday or simply talking past 7pm, would be almost as humiliating as a defeat on the Brexit deal. But not quite.Viewed in Westminster as all but impossible, a victory for May on Tuesday night would mean that Britain will probably leave the European Union on March 29th next year on the terms outlined in her deal.Without the support of the DUP, who will not support the deal, the prime minister could win only with the support of some Labour rebels. She would need to retain their support to approve enabling legislation for the deal next year.The DUP has said it would support the government in a confidence vote if the deal is rejected but if it passes, the confidence and supply agreement would be over. One senior DUP figure told me this week that Jeremy Corbyn’s history of support for Irish republicanism would not necessarily prevent the party from toppling a Conservative government.“It wasn’t a Labour secretary of state who said that Britain had no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland. And it wasn’t a Labour government that signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement that started all this,” he said.For a government to lose a vote by any margin on the most important piece of legislation in decades would in normal circumstances be calamitous. But expectations ahead of Tuesday’s vote are so dismal that if May loses by fewer than 50 votes, Downing Street will feel able to claim victory.To reverse such a loss, May would have to change the minds of perhaps a couple of dozen MPs, probably after securing some changes to the political declaration accompanying the withdrawal agreement. EU leaders are unlikely to offer any concrete concessions when they meet in Brussels next Thursday, not least because they fear that any changes offered so soon would lose their lustre over the Christmas break.In January, the EU could offer some cosmetic assurances about the backstop, perhaps in the form of an exchange of letters or an interpretive declaration. These would seek to reassure MPs that both sides would seek to avoid invoking the backstop and make every effort to ensure that it does not last for long.More than 100 MPs have already indicated that they will vote against the deal and even if the whips reduce that number by half, May would still lose by more than 100 votes. Such a defeat would lead many prime ministers to step down but May has a dogged sense of duty and is not the resigning type.If she refuses to go voluntarily, she will probably face a confidence vote in her leadership which she is now likely either to lose or to win by such a narrow margin that her position would be almost untenable.If she goes, a Conservative leadership election would see candidates from the cabinet, led by home secretary Sajid Javid and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, compete against a hard Brexiteer backed by the European Research Group, probably Boris Johnson or former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab.An expedited process could see MPs choosing two candidates to go before the party membership before Christmas, with a new leader in place in the first half of January. Any new leader would have to pursue a different Brexit strategy or seek substantive changes to the current deal.EU leaders, the Commission, European Council president Donald Tusk and chief negotiator Michel Barnier all insist that the text of the withdrawal agreement is now closed and cannot be renegotiated. But faced with a new British prime minister and the approaching threat of a no-deal Brexit, they could relent.One option would be to remove the UK-wide customs element of the backstop, so that the EU-UK customs relationship would be negotiated as part of the future trade arrangement. Instead of a time limit for the transition period, the two sides could renew it every year until a trade deal was agreed.This would remove the threat of Britain being trapped in the backstop once the transition period expired but it would leave the Northern Ireland-only backstop intact. This would make starker the regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and create a customs border in the Irish Sea.A more radical change would see the EU accede to British Eurosceptic demands for a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop. Such a change would secure the support even of the DUP because as one of the party’s MPs put it, “it would kill the backstop”.There have been only two small blips in the history of EU solidarity with Ireland over the backstop. Last summer, a Polish minister suggested the issue should be dealt with as part of the future relationship rather than included in the withdrawal agreement.And during last October’s summit, German chancellor Angela Merkel mused that if the deadlock over the backstop led to a no-deal Brexit, Ireland could see the creation of the hard border the backstop was designed to prevent.The Polish minister was slapped down and his government fell into line behind the backstop. Downing Street became greatly excited by Merkel’s remarks but according to those present, she was teasing out the issue intellectually rather than signalling that she wanted a change of course.Killing the backstop by means of a unilateral exit mechanism remains an unlikely option, not least because it would represent the betrayal of the interests of a remaining EU member-state for the sake of a state that is leaving the union.An amendment approved by MPs this week means that, if the Brexit deal is defeated next week, any new motion the government brings forward about Brexit in the coming weeks can be subject to amendments.This will allow MPs to direct the government on what to do next, including a rejection of a no-deal Brexit or an instruction to pursue a certain kind of deal. Although such an instruction is not legally binding, it would be hard for any government to ignore.Among the Conservative MPs who backed the amendment are some who support what they call Norway-plus – membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (Efta) and the EU customs union. The proposal also enjoys the support of many Labour MPs and has the quiet backing of some cabinet ministers.Under the plan, Britain would accept May’s withdrawal agreement but would modify the political declaration to set Norway-plus as the destination. Norway follows all EU single market regulations and accepts the free movement of people, although the EEA allows for a brake on free movement in certain circumstances.The plan has a number of difficulties, including the fact that Britain would still have to sign up to a Northern Ireland backstop to ensure that the Border would remain open should London choose to leave the EEA.Current Efta members are not wholeheartedly enthusiastic about Britain joining, partly because it is so much bigger than the others but also because some British politicians have made clear that they view the arrangement as a temporary one. The EU would impose stricter conditions on Britain than on Norway and would seek to ensure that the arrangement is durable and predictable.Support for Norway-plus at Westminster has fallen in recent weeks as pro-EU MPs believe the prospect of remaining in the EU altogether has become more likely.“That ship has sailed,” one former supporter of the plan said. “It’s all about the people’s vote now.”If May’s deal is rejected, the EU refuses to renegotiate it, and Norway-plus cannot win majority support, MPs will face a choice between leaving the EU without a deal and calling a second referendum. There is a clear majority in the House of Commons against a no-deal Brexit so a second referendum is more likely than ever before.Labour has said that, if May’s deal is defeated, it will seek a general election and if that fails, it will consider all options including “a public vote”. The DUP has made clear that it will support the government in a confidence vote if the deal is rejected, so Labour will not get its general election.The party is then likely to move swiftly behind the call for a second referendum, which is already backed by the other opposition parties and by a number of Conservative MPs. Some Brexiteers relish the prospect of a second vote, which they are confident will produce a resounding endorsement of Brexit.If May survives, calling a second referendum could be her best strategy for keeping her party together and keeping her Brexit deal alive. MPs would have to agree on the question to be put on the ballot paper: Leave or Remain? May’s deal or Remain? May’s deal or a no-deal Brexit? Or all three options in a referendum.A second referendum would take at least 12 weeks to set up and could require a short extension of the article 50 negotiating process, which the EU is likely to grant. Polls this week suggest that, if May’s deal is on the ballot, it would win.According to article 50, Britain will leave the EU on at 11pm on March 29th, 2019 and unless something intervenes it will do just that, deal or no deal. Although a majority in the House of Commons is opposed to leaving without a deal, MPs have not yet been able to form a majority behind any of the alternatives.This week’s amendment giving MPs a stronger voice in the direction of Brexit has made no deal less likely but it remains a real possibility if MPs fail to fall in behind May’s deal, Norway-plus or a second referendum. The EU says it will agree skeleton arrangements with Britain to ensure for example that planes can take off and land and that energy supplies will not be interrupted.But the short-term impact of a no-deal Brexit will be disruptive and costly, as much to Ireland as to Britain, with a likely plunge in sterling and delays to Irish exports into Britain and the rest of Europe.If these are anxious days in Westminster, there must be sleepless nights in Dublin too.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

united by a love for the sea, rather than rowing - but have not let this put a check on their ambitions as they eye a finish within 40 days.Training for the 26-year-old was disrupted in September, when he tied the knot with Ms Thorp, his childhood sweetheart, at a lavish event in Oxfordshire.The \u0026#34Oar Inspiring\u0026#34 team believe they stand a chance of winning the 3,000-mile endurance challenge“The wife is not that pleased I’m not there for Christmas, but she’s quite supportive,” he told The Sunday .“There were a few weeks in September when my training wasn’t really going on, but a few sacrifices here and there but I got back on it.“(My family) understand we’re off on an adventure and they’re looking forward to following it - with a holiday in Antigua at the end.”On December 12, the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge will pitch 28 small rowing boats against each other in a race from San Sebastian in La Gomera, Canary Islands, to Nelson’s Dockyard in Antigua, the Caribbean.Only around 500 people have successfully rowed the Atlantic - one-tenth of the number that have summited Mount Everest.Fewer people have rowed across the Atlantic than have summited Mount EverestInspiration came to Lord Blandford two years ago - prior to his engagement - when he saw the race listed in a book of the world’s toughest endurance challenges.His ancestors are no strangers to adversity, with a family tree including wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Charles Spencer, who led the British expeditionary force on continental Europe during the Seven Years’ War in the 18th century.Lord Blandford said: “I think there is an element of adventure in the family and it’s nice to be able to do something a bit different.“I’m at an age where there aren’t many more opportunities like this that will come across, so when I had the idea to do it, I wanted to get on with it and do it.”The Marquess of Blandford is a keen polo player who has competed against the Duke of SussexAnd his team - also including Justin Evelegh and brothers Caspar and Toby Thorp, the Marchioness’s cousins - are hoping to achieve more than just a finish.“We’re going to try and win but we certainly want to be in the top 10 per cent,” Lord Blandford said.“Our motivation is the quicker we get there, the longer we have in Antigua.”They plan to row 24 hours a day, with half the team rowing for three hours at a time before swapping, scaled back to two hours at the oars as the race progresses.The future Duke of Marlborough and his team have trained for more than a yearExhaustion can reach such peaks during the challenge that previous competitors have reported hallucinations, while waves have been known to reach up to 20ft.Technology on board will give Lord Blandford and his crew a slender connection to the outside world - with calls to home planned on Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve.Once their boat finally docks, however, it will be time for the Marquess of Blandford to pick up marital responsibilities again with his new wife.  “We had a 10-day honeymoon, but I’ve promised her that we’ll do an extended stay in Antigua afterwards,” he said.Oar Inspiring are aiming to raise enough money to pay for a year’s worth of wishes for seriously ill children and can be sponsored at https:www.justgiving campaignscharity starlightchildrensfoundation oarinspiringPlease review our commenting policyStrictly Come Dancing 2018, semi-final live: Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer tied at top but Lauren Steadman in trouble \u0026#39Yellow vest\u0026#39 protests: cars burn and looters raid shops in ParisComment: This Brexit deal is not perfect -

The Purple One falls into the category with tby far the most sweets, the caramelfudge type, which also includes the Caramel Swirl, Fudge, Toffee Penny, Coconut Eclair, Toffee Deluxe, Toffee Finger.The contents of a tub of Quality StreetsNestle appears to be cashing in on its less than ideal flavour ratios by teaming up with John Lewis to offer chocolate lovers the chance to fill a 1.2kg Quality Street tub with their own handpicked selection of chocolates. Shoppers can fill up with as many Purple or Green Ones as they can stuff into their tins - but for £12 - which is nearly twice the price of a same sized tin at Sainsbury\u0027s, which costs £7. Which? also ranked the flavours in tubs of Mars’ Celebrations, and Cadbury’s Heroes and Roses according to popularity, to determine what proportion of each should make up the perfect assortment.    Conversely, it found families were less likely to fight over Roses as there were an abundance of Strawberry Creams, the most popular chocolate. This is because the fruit cream category comprises just two flavours (Strawberry Delight and Orange Creme).  Cadbury’s said it chooses a random selection in tins of Roses which it said is designed to be enjoyed by all. When it comes to Celebrations there is good news for fans of Malteser Teasers, the most popular in the tub, as Which? found it is one of the most abundant chocolates with an average of 10 in each tub. Mars also has a random selection process for filling tubs. The Purple One - one of the nation\u0026#39s favourite Quality Street chocolatesThere was also disappointment for fans of Cadbury\u0027s Heroes, as despite Wispas and Twirls being the most highly coveted, they had the fewest chocolates per box, with 30 per cent and 29 per cent ranking them as their favourites, but only an average of 9 and 6 in a box.Harry Rose, Editor of Which? Magazine, said: “Our analysis shows that it’s not your family’s fault that your favourite flavours disappear from the tub so quickly: there really are too few Purple Ones to meet popular demand.“Of course, if you’re a fan of Strawberry Delights, Eclairs or Milky Ways, this will be welcome news - you’re more likely to still be eating chocolates into the New Year than your Wispa-loving friends.”A spokesman for Nestle said: “We do take the popularity of inidual sweets into account and have increased the number of people’s favourites in this year’s assortment. Our research shows that the Caramel Swirl is the sweet with the broadest appeal but other studies point to The Purple One or the Strawberry Delight as being more popular. Part of the fun of Christmas is the family discussion about each of our favourites and who gets the last sweet.A spokesperson for Cadbury said: “The mix for our Roses and Heroes tubs are specifically hand-picked and we review the mix regularly to ensure we are giving our customers an assortment of the best chocolate that they love. However, there can be some minor deviations in the mix due to manufacturing processes.A spokesperson for Mars Wrigley Confectionery UK said: “Every year we enjoy seeing the debates rage about the nation’s favourite Celebrations.Strictly Come Dancing 2018, semi-final live: Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer tied at top but Lauren Steadman in trouble \u0026#39Yellow vest\u0026#39 protests: cars burn and looters raid shops in ParisComment: This Brexit deal is not perfect - but the alternatives are worse\u0026#39I\u0026#39ve been cheated out of record,\u0026#39 says angry angler who netted 5 stone carpWaitrose first supermarket to use robots to farm its foodIndian soldier arrested over murder of policeman sent to investigate killing of sacred cowDonald Trump throws his support behind Paris \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 protestsComment: I am resigning from the Government because May\u0026#39s Brexit deal means obeying EU rules for years to comeComment: We must defeat Theresa May\u0026#39s wretched Brexit deal and go out into the world with hope and imagination John Kelly to leave the White House at the end of yearShortage of grouse has cost rural communities millions Coal mine could be built next to one of Northumberland\u0026#39s most beautiful beaches after High Court appealNigel Farage unveils plan to form new party to fight \u0026#39biggest battle yet\u0026#39 for independence from EUMarquess of Blandford admits new bride \u0026#39not that pleased\u0026#39 as he prepares to embark on 3,000-mile Atlantic rowRobert Mueller’s final Russia probe report may never be made publicGypsy Girl mosaic returns to Turkey 50 years after its plunderScouts can save children from extremism and gangs, says Bear GryllsJacline Mouraud: Founder of Yellow Vest movement denounces extremists hijacking her tax protestWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/20/21/david-davis.jpg","title":"house prices uk brexit property market london decline halifax index","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Property prices in the three months from September to November fell 1.1 per cent compared with the preceding quarter, while prices dropped 1.4 per cent between October and November. Meanwhile, the rate of growth dropped to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate since December 2012. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market.

Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: “The usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home.”Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “Looking forward, we don’t expect activity to change much, bearing in mind seasonal and political distractions. On the ground, lethargy is replacing energy.”Gary Barker, chief executive of proptech company Reapit, also predicted a continuation of the current subdued performance. “Transactions have been flat for the past three years, and caution is likely to remain whilst Brexit remains unfinished. Furthermore, if Brexit stalls, or more significant uncertainty over the government develops, it will be a painful road ahead,” he said. Mr Barker said that there could be room for optimism: “We are seeing house price reduction in some areas, which could make property more affordable and also boost the economy by increasing spending power and buying capacity. “If the Brexit deal passes through parliament, we could potentially see a much more confident market, resulting in more transactions, fewer withdrawals, and increased prices.”However, he added: “If the Bank of England’s forecast of a 30 per cent drop in house prices comes to fruition following a no-deal Brexit, the balance of the market will shift dramatically. “Although transactions may reduce significantly, with depressed prices discouraging sellers from listing their properties, low prices will put buyers back in control. First-time buyers, in particular, could benefit from slashed prices, giving them a leg-up onto the property ladder.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The oil producing nations had been expected to agree to a reduction in production on Thursday at its meeting in Vienna. Reaching a deal proved difficult as sanctions-hit Iran refused to comply with the output cuts, despite the input of non-Opec member Russia. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe stalemate led the oil price to fall - the commodity had previously dropped by 30 per cent from four-year highs of more than $86 per barrel in October to below $59 at the end of November. However, a second day of talks led to an agreement, providing a boost to the price of Brent crude which rose to $63.25 by mid-afternoon on Friday. Qatar to quit Opec in 2019 amid angry dispute with Saudi ArabiaWhat is OPEC and why has Qatar left its ranks?Trump hits out at OPEC and says oil prices are artificially very highWhy Opec is caught between a rock and a hard placeBarani Krishnan, senior analyst at Investing, said it was natural that oil traders would react as positively to Opec’s decision to cut production as they did negatively “when the group seemed powerless to reduce even a barrel”. He added: “However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly.”Mr Krishnan said the bigger takeaway is “what the Saudi energy minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today a Russia that has become as powerful to Opec as Riyadh and a US that is now a net exporter of oil”.Furthermore, we\u0027ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts,” he added. “One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.Donald Trump had called on Opec to leave production unfettered in order to weigh prices down, tweeting ahead of the Vienna meeting: “The world does not want to see… higher oil prices”. Meanwhile, Ashley Kelty, oil \u0026amp gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said that although cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day was a larger reduction than some had expected, it was still short of “what is really required to bring the market back into balance”. She said: “Our initial snap judgement is that prices will stabilise in the $60-65 per barrel range, as the cuts are likely to be insufficient to stem the near term supply glut, given US output is continuing to \u0026nbsprise (albeit at a slower pace due to capacity constraints).“It feels like a bit of a fudge, and the absence of the final communique at this late stage suggests that a lot of horse trading has been underway to reach a situation that tries to appeal to all parties, whilst ending up with a situation that will appease no-one.”Earlier this week, Qatar quit Opec, however, it still attended the meeting in Vienna.

Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next.

Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.MacGowan went on to say that he does not want to get into an argument about the song and has no problem with it being censored during radio airplay.“If people don\u0027t understand that I was trying to accurately portray the character as authentically as possible then I am absolutely fine with them bleeping the word but I don\u0027t want to get into an argument,” he concluded.RTÉ yesterday confirmed that the song will continue to be played uncensored on RTE radio as it has for the past 30 years.Fairytale of New YorkShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

Property prices in the three months from September to November fell 1.1 per cent compared with the preceding quarter, while prices dropped 1.4 per cent between October and November. Meanwhile, the rate of growth dropped to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate since December 2012. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market.

Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: “The usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home.”Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “Looking forward, we don’t expect activity to change much, bearing in mind seasonal and political distractions. On the ground, lethargy is replacing energy.”Gary Barker, chief executive of proptech company Reapit, also predicted a continuation of the current subdued performance. “Transactions have been flat for the past three years, and caution is likely to remain whilst Brexit remains unfinished. Furthermore, if Brexit stalls, or more significant uncertainty over the government develops, it will be a painful road ahead,” he said. Mr Barker said that there could be room for optimism: “We are seeing house price reduction in some areas, which could make property more affordable and also boost the economy by increasing spending power and buying capacity. “If the Brexit deal passes through parliament, we could potentially see a much more confident market, resulting in more transactions, fewer withdrawals, and increased prices.”However, he added: “If the Bank of England’s forecast of a 30 per cent drop in house prices comes to fruition following a no-deal Brexit, the balance of the market will shift dramatically. “Although transactions may reduce significantly, with depressed prices discouraging sellers from listing their properties, low prices will put buyers back in control. First-time buyers, in particular, could benefit from slashed prices, giving them a leg-up onto the property ladder.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Instagram doesn\u0027t offer the feature, however.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThankfully, you don\u0027t have to pick through all your pictures and find out the best ones: there\u0027s plenty of websites available to do that for you. The best one appears to be topnine.co, which includes some extra features like the ability to see how many likes you managed to get over the entire year.That site seems to be having problem in some countries, such as the UK – perhaps because of more stringent privacy rules – and so if you can\u0027t use that one you could head to the 2018bestnine site. It\u0027s not quite as neat, runs quite slowly and sticks a fairly ugly watermark on the bottom, but it includes some clever features, such as the ability to choose any date range that you like.Whichever one you use, just head to that site, give it your username, and it\u0027ll sort everything out from there. You can even give it someone else\u0027s username, should you want to see their best nine.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.Instagram finally lets people choose who sees storiesThe feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you\u0027re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn\u0027t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you\u0027ve locked it down you won\u0027t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back. As long as you do it quickly then it is unlikely anyone will notice.Another option is to make your own best nine, by picking through your photos and then arranging them into a collage using Instagram\u0027s own Layout app. That has the advantage of allowing you to choose any photos you wish you were included but aren\u0027t – but the downside of having to pick manually through what might be hundreds of photos.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. 140 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience.

Hart had previously made a series of jokes that were deemed homophobic, including Tweets posted between 2009-11 which have since been deleted. One read: “Yo if my son comes home \u0026amp\u0026nbsp try’s \u0026nbsp2 play with my\u0026nbsp daughters \u0026nbspdoll house I’m going 2 break \u0026nbspit over his head \u0026amp say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay’.”During a stand-up show, he said: “One of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay,” he said. ”That’s a fear. Keep in mind, I’m not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, be happy. Do what you want to do. But me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will. Now with that being said, I don’t know if I handled my son’s first gay moment correctly. Every kid has a gay moment but when it happens, you’ve got to nip it in the bud!”It’s a shame Kevin Hart furore will ert attention away from MeTooIn 2015, Hart revealed that he turned down a role in 2008’s\u0026nbspTropic Thunder\u0026nbspbecause the character was gay and his behaviour was “real flagrant”, before adding that he’d never be able to play a gay character in the future.In an Instagram post before stepping down as Oscars host, Hart spoke out against the “negative energy” of the criticism towards the comments, asking people to “stop searching for reasons to be angry”. He said he was almost 40 years old and was “in love with the man I’m becoming”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But, argue\u0026nbspJohn Curtice\u0026nbspand his co-authors in a new book edited by Philip Cowley and Denis Kavanagh, the real Brexit referendum actually happened a year laterClick to followThe IndependentThe social geography of the 2017 general election was shaped by attitudes towards BrexitIf voters agreed with the prime minister that the 2017 general election was about Brexit, then – given that her vision of Britain’s future relationship with the EU was widely regarded as representing a “hard” Brexit (prioritising control of immigration over continued membership of the EU single market) – we might expect her party to have advanced more strongly in places where the previous year a relatively high proportion had voted to leave the EU.Our analysis suggests this is precisely what happened. The higher the estimated vote for Leave in 2016, the more the Conservative vote increased, while support for the party actually fell back on average in places where Leave failed to secure at least 45 per cent of the vote.\u0026nbspThe link between Labour’s performance and the strength of the Leave vote in 2016 is much weaker, a finding that might be thought to reflect the party’s relatively ambiguous position on Brexit.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersThere was only a three-point difference between the increase in the Labour vote in places where 60 per cent or more voted to Leave and the equivalent figure for constituencies where less than 45 per cent voted to Leave – far less than the corresponding difference of 12 points in the Conservative performance.Even so, between them these two patterns are sufficiently strong that in seats where more than 60 per cent voted to Leave, there was on average a net (total vote) swing of 0.8 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives, even though everywhere else in England and Wales Labour’s vote increased more than that of the Conservatives.Where did the Ukip vote go?A key reason why the link between the Conservative performance and the strength of the Leave vote is much stronger than that for Labour lies in the impact on the two parties’ performances of the collapse in the Ukip vote.Ukip’s share of the vote in the 2015 election was much larger in areas where Leave did well in the referendum. The decline in Ukip support two years later was almost invariably greatest where the party had previously been strongest. If those who voted Ukip in 2015 (nearly all of whom voted to Leave in 2016) were now particularly inclined to switch to the Conservatives, this could have served to boost the Conservative performance in constituencies that voted heavily to Leave.Indeed, while Labour\u0026nbspappears to have won some of the voters that Ukip lost, the Conservatives apparently gained many more.Ukip in 2017 was almost invariably greatest in areas where the party had been strongest before (Getty)Nevertheless, the collapse in Ukip support is far from being the whole explanation for the strong Conservative performance in areas keenest on leaving the EU. Even when we take into account how heavily Ukip support fell, the Conservatives still performed better where the Leave vote was stronger in 2016.Where did Remain and Leave voters go? The Conservative Party did not do well in places where Leave was strong in 2016 only because of the pattern of switching among\u0026nbspformer Ukip voters rather, Leave voters more generally seem to have been drawn into voting Conservative at this election, while Remain voters tilted towards Labour.Support for Ukip in 2015 and for Leave in 2016 varied substantially by age and educational background. Both were particularly popular with older people and those with few or no formal educational qualifications, while younger people and graduates tended to shun Ukip and vote Remain. This pattern was reflected in the Conservative and Labour votes in 2017.Created with Sketch.EU referendum - in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman in a wheelchair with British and European Union flags shows her support for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union on the day of the EU Referendum in GibraltarA polling station being used in the EU referendum at Batley Town Hall in the constituency Labour MP Jo CoxPeople arrive to vote in the EU Referendum at the Library where British MP Jo Cox was shot and fatally wounded last week in BirstallA man arrives to vote at a polling station for the Referendum on the European Union in north LondonVoters queue to enter a polling station at Trinity Church in Golders Green in LondonBritish Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha Cameron leave after voting in the EU Referendum at Central Methodist Hall, Westminster Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn cast his vote at a polling station at Pakeman Primary School in IslingtonChelsea pensioners arrive at a polling station near to the Royal Chelsea HospitalA woman wearing an I\u0027m In t-shirt, promoting the official Remain campaign, leaves a polling station in LondonPeople queuing outside a polling station on Amott Road in LondonScotland\u0027s First Minister and Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, react as leave after casting their votes at a polling station at Broomhouse Community Hall in east GlasgowA man wearing a European themed cycling jersey leaves after voting at a polling station for the Referendum on the European Union in north LondonUkip leader Nigel Farage arrives to cast his vote at Cudham Church of England Primary School in Biggin Hill, KentJustice Secretary and prominent \u0027Vote Leave\u0027 campaigner Michael Gove poses with his wife Sarah Vine after voting in the European Union referendum at their local polling station in KensingtonNuns leave a polling station after voting in the EU Referendum in LondonPeople arrive to cast their ballots in the EU Referendum in Gibraltar.

There is a corresponding, though much weaker tendency in the opposite direction for Labour. At the same time, the Conservatives performed less well and Labour better in seats with more young adults – though once we take this into account, there is no indication, despite the prominence given to Labour’s manifesto promise to scrap tuition fees for students at English universities, that constituencies with large numbers of students were particularly likely to swing towards the party.The social geography of Conservative and Labour performance at this election was primarily, albeit not entirely, a consequence of the role played by attitudes towards Brexit in shaping how people voted.What about the economy?Traditionally, the state of the economy has played a central role in how people vote. In 2015, for example, the Conservatives clearly performed worse where unemployment was highest or had increased most, and where household incomes were relatively low. At this election, however, if anything the opposite was the case.Revolutionary study into voter \u0027clans\u0027 holds key to 2022 electionThe worse local economic circumstances were, the better the Conservatives did and the worse Labour did. For instance, Conservative support increased on average by 5.8 points where the constituency unemployment rate increased between 2015 and 2017, compared with 4.9 points where it fell. The equivalent figures for Labour were 9.8 points and 10.4 points respectively. Moreover, despite a continued squeeze on public spending and a promise from the Conservatives of more austerity to come that could mean cuts in public sector jobs, there was, in contrast to 2015, no particular relationship between Conservative or Labour performance and the local prevalence of public sector employees.Did the antisemitism row hurt Labour?Not that the focus on Brexit meant that nothing else mattered. Jeremy Corbyn’s views on the Middle East have attracted particular controversy, with critics accusing the Labour leader of being too sympathetic to iniduals and groups opposed to Israel, including some widely regarded as extremist. There were related accusations that, under Corbyn’s leadership, the Labour Party had dealt inadequately with allegations that some party members have made antisemitic statements. These issues appear to have made a difference. On average Labour’s vote increased by 11.6 points in constituencies where more than 4 per cent are Muslim, compared with an average increase of 9.6 points elsewhere in England and Wales. This difference is not accounted for by the tendency of the Leave vote to be lower in seats with more Muslims. Meanwhile, and by contrast, the Labour vote only rose by 8.8 points on average across the 10 constituencies with the largest Jewish populations, even though seven of these 10 seats are in London, where Labour generally performed relatively well.Did social class drive the voting?However, the fallout from the EU referendum was most important in shaping the geography of Conservative and Labour performance. In so doing, the contest served to reduce some of the traditional isions in British elections. For example, although working-class voters had traditionally been the bedrock of Labour support, they had also been more likely to vote Leave and to vote for Ukip. Thus, thanks to its gains among such voters, at this election Conservative support increased by as much as 9.4 points in seats where more than 13 per cent are engaged in a routine manual occupation, compared with just 1.3 points where fewer than 10 per cent have a routine job. Conversely, Labour’s support increased by just 9.1 points in relatively working-class seats, but by 10.7 points where relatively few have a routine job.\u0026nbspWhat happened to the northsouth ide?Equally, the northsouth ide in Britain’s electoral geography also narrowed somewhat, the first time it has done so since 1997. A relatively weak Conservative performance and a relatively strong Labour performance across the largely more pro-Remain south of England\u0026nbspmeant that on average there was as much as a 3.9 point swing from Conservative to Labour there.In contrast, the swing to Labour was only 1.3 in the north of England and 0.7\u0026nbspin the heavily pro-Leave Midlands. One striking consequence of this ergence is that Conservative support is now higher in the Midlands than in the south of England, not least, but also not solely, because pro-Remain and ethnically erse London has now become something of a Labour citadel.Paxman returned to Newsnight to interrogate May and Corbyn (Getty)Despite initial appearances, therefore, this clearly was not an election that heralded a return to the familiar patterns of two-party politics.Do constituency boundaries hold the key?But what about the notion that the makeup of parliament is as much to do with the way constituency boundaries have been drawn as anything else? That question is particularly topical, given current proposals for boundary reform. \u0026nbspThe present constituency boundaries are biased against the Conservatives, but this is compensated for by the more efficient distribution of their vote.Surprising though the failure of the Conservatives to win an overall majority last year might have seemed, was the tally of seats won by each party significantly different from what we might have anticipated given the shares of the vote each of them secured?\u0026nbspThe traditional way of addressing this question has been to compare the actual outcome in seats with what would have happened if in every constituency each party’s share of the vote had increased or fallen in line with the change in its overall share of the vote across Britain as a whole – that is, uniform change.However, applying this method becomes difficult when, as happened in 2015 and again in 2017, there is a substantial change in the level of support for a party, such as the SNP, that only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there. In these circumstances the change in that party’s share of the Britain-wide vote will inevitably be but a pale reflection of the actual rise or fall in its support in the part of the UK where it stood.It is therefore better to use as our initial benchmark what would have happened if support for all of the main Britain-wide parties had increased or fallen in every constituency in England and Wales in line with the overall change in their support in those two parts of the UK combined. For each seat in Scotland, meanwhile, we calculate what would have happened if the rise or fall in each party’s support had been in line with the change in its share of the Scotland-wide total.On the basis of these assumptions, the Conservatives would have won 323 seats (instead of 318), Labour 259 (262), the SNP 37 (35), the Liberal Democrat nine (12), Plaid Cymru three (four) and the Greens one (one), while, of course, there would be 18 other MPs from Northern Ireland. None of these figures are\u0026nbspvery different from what actually transpired and, above all, the Conservatives would still have failed to secure an overall majority – albeit they would have been only three rather than eight seats short.What about Scotland?That projected Conservative tally includes 11 seats in Scotland. However, if the increase in the Conservative vote north of the border had been in line with the lower increase in England and Wales – and the fall in SNP support had not happened – the Conservatives would have won only two Scottish seats. Thus, in the absence of the distinctive outcome in Scotland, the Conservatives would have won only 314 seats. To that extent, the distinctive result in Scotland proved to be crucial to the arithmetic of the new House of Commons.SNP only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there (Getty)What were the other factors?However, although the overall tally of seats for each party was more or less in line with what might have been expected given the changes in their overall shares of the vote, there were lots of seats where the outcome was at variance with what would have happened if the movements in party support had been the same everywhere.What if Nick Clegg had gone into coalition with Labour in 2010?No fewer than 36 seats changed hands that would not have done so under those circumstances, while 16 constituencies were held against the tide. Most of these outcomes can in fact be accounted for by one or other of the systematic patterns of variation our analysis has identified, including the tendency for the Conservatives to perform better in seats with a relatively large Leave vote and Labour to do likewise in seats where Remain polled relatively well, the Conservatives’ ability on occasion to squeeze the other unionist parties in Scotland, and the willingness of some of those who might otherwise have voted Labour to make a tactical switch to the (pro-Remain) Liberal Democrats. In short, much of the significant variation in party performance was linked in some way or other to the fallout from either the 2016 EU referendum or the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.Dem leader Tim Farron narrowly retained his seat with 8.4 per cent swing to the Tories (Getty)This still leaves us with the observation that for the third time in a row, the electoral system failed to deliver the winning party a substantial overall majority (and, indeed, on two occasions any majority at all).The system’s ability to generate safe overall majorities has long been regarded as a hallmark of the single member plurality system (often referred to as “first past the post”) and the resulting clarity of the link between the outcome of an election and who forms the government is often cited as a major justification for its continued use.It might be thought the explanation is that, at 2.5 points, the Conservative lead over Labour in terms of votes across Great Britain as a whole was a relatively narrow one. It was certainly much narrower than the seven point leads that the Conservatives enjoyed in 2010 and 2015. Yet it was larger than the leads (in Great Britain) that the Conservatives enjoyed in 1955 (1.9 points) and 1970 (2.3 points) or Labour did in 1964 (1.9 points), yet those three contests all resulted in an overall majority, including in two instances a relatively safe one.Historical precedent apparently suggests that the Conservative lead should have been sufficient to give the party an overall majority.What about variable constituency sizes?One consequence of the prime minister’s decision to secure a Commons vote for an early election is that the contest had to be fought on the same constituency boundaries as in 2015 and not on the new boundaries the various parliamentary boundary commissions were in the midst of preparing in readiness for an election in 2020.The resulting inequality in the sizes of constituencies was certainly a disadvantage for the Conservatives. The average electorate in constituencies they won at this election was 74,451, whereas in seats won by Labour it was 70,529. The difference of some 3,920 people was around 520 bigger than it had been two years previously.The gap may have been increased somewhat by the government’s decision in 2015 to speed up the introduction of inidual electoral registration, which resulted in particularly sharp drops in registration in some typically Labour-held constituencies with large numbers of students. But the gap was then narrowed somewhat by the applications to be added to the register many (and especially younger) voters made after its initial compilation in December 2016. These added 2,300 names on average to the register in constituencies that Labour won, compared with just 1,600 on average in seats won by the Conservatives.Did voter turnout make a difference?However, inequalities in the registered electorate are not the only consideration that we have to bear in mind in considering the sizes of constituencies. Bias might also arise if turnout is lower in seats held by one party than it is in those won by its opponents. Indeed, turnout was on average some four points lower on average in seats won by Labour at this election (66.5 per cent) than it was in those won by the Conservatives (70.7 per cent).\u0026nbspAFPGetty)That said, this was a noticeably smaller gap than in 2015, for turnout increased on average by 3.8 points in seats Labour won, but by only 2.0 points in those won by the Conservatives. As a result, at 5,675 votes, the difference between Conservative and Labour-held seats in terms of the total number of votes cast was actually smaller at this election than it had been in the same two sets of seats two years previously (6,541).To this we need to add one other consideration. The relative success of the Conservatives in seats with a relatively high Leave vote meant that the increase in the party’s vote was often greater in more working-class seats outside of London and the south of England, whose populations have grown less rapidly and thus tend to have lower than average electorates.For example, Conservative support increased on average by as much as 7.3 points in seats in which fewer than 72,000 people were registered to vote, compared with just 4.3 points where more than 77,000 names appeared on the register. Similarly, while the Conservative vote increased on average by 9.7 points where turnout was less than 65 per cent, it increased by just 3.2 points where turnout was above 71 per cent. As a result, there was a noticeable reduction in the extent to which the Conservative vote was concentrated in constituencies where more people turned out to vote.Created with Sketch.

The Labour Party was ahead of the Conservatives by more than 40 points in 27 per cent of seats that it won, while the Conservative Party was that far ahead of Labour in just 12 per cent of the constituencies that it won.\u0026nbspIn short, whatever disadvantage the Conservatives suffered as a result of inequalities in the sizes of constituencies tended to be compensated by them having a more efficiently distributed vote.John\u0026nbspCurtice, Strathclyde University, Stephen Fisher, Trinity College, Oxford, and Robert Ford and Patrick English, University of Manchester, are authors of The Results Analysed, in ‘The British General Election of 2017’, edited by Philip Cowley and Dennis\u0026nbspKavanagh, from which this article is extractedShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Back then in 2000, she wasn’t yet one of the great icons of popular culture. All I knew about her was the publicity cliché of her being a single mother made good. It was the same tired story repeated constantly about her.\u0026nbspSo I ignored all that and started her journey at the beginning in the villages near Bristol where she grew up.I discovered she was childhood friends with the Potter family who had lived in the same street and I spoke to them about childhood dressing-up games and Jo Rowling’s vivid imagination. I remember Mrs Potter telling me that Jo always had a big aversion to spiders.

I met her best Portuguese friend who worked with her at the school. She invited me to a family party at a restaurant where all these delicious dishes kept on appearing throughout the night the children ran around playing games and we drank wine and talked. It was a perfect evening. She told me the story of how she helped Jo extricate herself from her unhappy first marriage to a local man and return hastily to the UK with her young daughter. She also told me at the time she thought Jo was a nervous person, anxious and flitting around like a butterfly.Rowling\u0026nbspto Oporto in Portugal, where she was married to a local man and teaching English as a foreign language (AFPGetty)Through the eyes of the people I spoke to, I was able to build a picture of a real person – not one created by a publicity department. People like to talk if given the chance. I realised that when I was responsible for reporting golden and diamond wedding anniversaries on a weekly newspaper. That may sound boring but I loved it – the chance to hear about people’s lives while having a cup of tea and piece of homemade fruit cake. But you can’t pretend to be interested. That’s impossible to fake.

In my job, if you turn off the phone and laptop and talk to people, things happen.The lesson I learned very early on in my career is that everyone deserves your time and attention. We live in an online world where the art of proper conversation is disappearing. In my job, if you turn off the phone and laptop and talk to people, things happen. If you follow the footsteps of your subject, you make connections. You get insight and you get lucky.I stopped off to buy a sandwich and a beer at the grocery store in Laurel Canyon, the Bohemian area of Los Angeles where Jennifer Aniston used to live when she was a struggling actress. I asked the guy on the till if he had ever come across her. ‘She used to work here,’ he said and proceeded to tell me all about it. He made me laugh because he wasn’t so impressed with Jennifer, who, after all, was still a shop assistant in his eyes. But his eyes lit up when he told me that Sophia Loren had once been in his store.I met with Jennifer’s school drama teacher Anthony Abeson in New York and went along to one of his classes. He had great enthusiasm for Jennifer as an actress. He told me about the time at the Fame School where his pupils had to prepare a scene for performance in front of class and she chose a particularly difficult one from The Three Sisters by Chekhov. It was meant to be very dramatic but everyone laughed. She was mortified. Afterwards, Anthony took her aside and told her she had a wonderful gift and it was marvellous that she had this ability to amuse. His words were life changing for her.\u0026nbspI was in McComb, Mississippi, which is where Britney Spears went to school. I was given an address for her first boyfriend about 10\u0026nbspmiles out of town so I drove out but there was no one there. There were no other houses. Nothing –\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspdead end. As I was leaving, a car pulled up. It was his mother, who was a charming woman. She\u0026nbspinvited me into her amazing mansion for coffee. She was a very accomplished painter and showed me her work. She rang up her son and he agreed to speak to me.He was great company and took me to a barbecue in the Mississippi woods. We chatted and drank beer and threw golf balls into the woods for his dog to fetch. He told me he once took Britney turkey hunting but she had to give up when she was bitten to hell by mosquitoes. This is a long way from Las Vegas and when night falls you can hear the coyotes – it’s a scary place. Britney didn’t like the nights in the woods and would get upset and have to be taken home. I don’t blame her.One of the myths about Britney is that she is some sort of trailer trash from the Deep South. This is nonsense. She went to a private school, where, incidentally, she was taught creationismOne of the myths about Britney is that she is some sort of trailer trash from the Deep South. This is nonsense. She went to a private school, where, incidentally, she was taught creationism. She had private dancing lessons. Her teenage boyfriend’s house had an elevator between floors. Money was tight when her dad’s building firm collapsed but she was brought up as a nice little girl. I remember speaking to her teacher at the Disney School in Orlando, Florida, when she was under contract to Disney. He told me that she was ‘the most wholesome, huggable little girl that you would ever want to see’. This is the real Britney Spears.\u0026nbspBritney used to date Justin Timberlake, who I also wrote about. I flew into Memphis, where I thought he was from, only to discover he was actually brought up 20\u0026nbspmiles away in the comfortable middle-class community of Shelby Forest, on the outskirts of the town of Millington.\u0026nbspOn my first day there I went into the local Millington library and asked loudly, ‘Does anyone here know Justin Timberlake?’ A woman piped up:\u0026nbsp‘My daughter was in his class at school.’ She put me in touch with her daughter and we had a lovely lunch and she told me about growing up in Shelby Forest.Apparently Justin was a Maths geek at school and was in the algebra club. She also recalled the school’s Christmas concert when the power failed. The enormous school gym was packed with bewildered parents and children sitting in complete darkness. Suddenly a voice launched forth from the gloom. It was Justin, aged 11, singing ‘O Holy Night’, unaccompanied. My lunch companion remembered, ‘The whole gym was in tears.’The most interesting thing about Rob, however, was learning that he\u0026nbspwasn’t entirely Jack the Lad. \u0026nbspHe\u0026nbsppreferred to take part in\u0026nbsppanto\u0026nbspthan kick a ball around in the parkI also had lunch with Justin’s delightful first girlfriend, who was looking forward to her wedding to a local doctor. She told me about the time she and Justin had decided to make love for the first time. They needed to buy condoms but that was tricky because Justin’s stepmum was the local pharmacist. In the end they had to catch the bus into Memphis to purchase a pack of three. Danielle’s pet name for Justin was ‘Stud Muffin’, a dream nickname for any teenage boy.\u0026nbspI love being able to share interesting new things about people we admire and care about. Take Robbie Williams for example. I had a great time in Stoke on Trent drinking with his old school buddies. They called him Rob – he wasn’t Robbie until Take That’s manager decided to call him that for his image. Rob and his friends were rascals. They used to ring up random numbers and tell jokes on the answer machine until the tape ran out.\u0026nbspThe most interesting thing about Rob, however, was learning that he wasn’t entirely Jack the Lad. He was a\u0026nbsprather a sensitive boy and a highly talented one who preferred to take part in panto than kick a ball around in the park. His father, a professional comedian, left home when he was a youngster and it had a profound effect on him.Why some people don\u0027t celebrate ThanksgivingAutistic boy writes letter to Anne Hegerty calling her an inspirationYoung people more inspired by grandparents than celebrities, pollI learnt much of his true nature from a wonderful woman called Zoe who was his closest friend in amateur dramatics for 10\u0026nbspyears. They were inseparable. They were in Chittty Chitty Bang Bang, Annie, Pickwick and Oliver together. In Oliver he was the Artful Dodger. On the opening night, Zoe knew something was wrong. He was singing ‘Consider Yourself’ and he just wasn’t himself. Off stage she could see he was upset, so put her arm around him and asked him what was wrong. He told her:\u0026nbsp‘I just started my first lines and I look up and there is my effing old man in the front row.’ He started crying but he went back out and gave the performance of his young life for his Dad.\u0026nbspI really warmed to Robbie. \u0026nbspI don’t write about celebrities. It’s a meaningless word these days, isn’t it? Celebrity used to mean something when we idolised proper stars such as\u0026nbspMarilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn or Elvis.\u0026nbsp Now, everybody is a celebrity who has been on television for two seconds. I write about the most famous people in the world: Adele, Cheryl, Kate Middleton and my latest subject, Ed Sheeran.But, more than that, I write about real people. When I was looking at the amazing life of Adele, I went into the flower shop in South London where she used to buy flowers for her mum and the young assistant in there said to me:\u0026nbsp‘I love Adele. She keeps it real.’\u0026nbspGeorge Michael, who I wrote about following his very sad death, is an example of someone who the world\u0026nbspdidn’t really know during his lifetime. He was poorly treated by the media while he was alive. He turned out to be a thoroughly decent man, a good man. But he\u0026nbspwasn’t George Michael until he was 18. He was\u0026nbspGeorgios Panayiotou, a Greek Cypriot boy.I interviewed his girlfriends from school and they were so warm about him. It was a joy. first girlfriend told me the story of how at her 16th birthday party, Yog, as she called him, turned up at her parents’ house with Andy – Andrew Ridgeley. It was a great night and later in the evening she looked out of the window into the garden to see the two future superstars of Wham! peeing into the fishpond.Ed Sheeran by Sean Smith is published by HarperCollins and is out now.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We work hard to ensure that our customers can limit the impact and restore their services as soon as possible.”Ericsson says O2 data will be coming back ‘as soon as possible’The company said most of its affected customers had got back online, but that some – presumably including Tesco – were still not working, and that it was continuing to work with them.On Thursday evening, O2’s\u0026nbspchief executive said\u0026nbsphe was “sorry because we have let our customers down”.\u0026nbspMark Evans told Sky News restoration of the network had started and it would be completed by Friday morning.\u0026nbspPressed\u0026nbspby Sky News host\u0026nbspDermot Murnaghan\u0026nbspif the company would compensate customers, Mr Evans would only say it would “find a way of making an apology in an O2 way”.\u0026nbspMr Evans admitted, however,\u0026nbsphe did “not know yet” what “an O2 way” meant.The problems with the service provide\u0026nbsphave hit as many as 30 million people in the UK, affecting not only O2 customers but users of the networks that borrow their infrastructure, such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff.It also hit transport networks and other systems that rely on O2’s\u0026nbspinternet connections to transfer data.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It still appears to be affecting every customer\u0026nbspof O2.As well as the network\u0027s own users, customers of other carriers that rely on O2 – such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff\u0026nbsp– are also unable to get online.O2 said the problem was affecting only internet\u0026nbspconnections, and some texts. But many customers said they have no signal at all, and calls are not getting through either.The problems have also hit systems that seem entirely unrelated, such as live updating bus arrivals boards, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata network to report where they are.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They will be informed about when that is available.O2 data network restored after millions hit by day-long outageAnd pay as you go customers on O2\u0027s mobile broadband will also be given a 10 per cent discount on a Bolt On purchase in the new year.All of O2\u0027s\u0026nbsp30 million customers are thought to have been hit by the outage, and so will be receiving the free package.Customers do not appear to need to do anything to get the refund, and will either be contacted to alert them to it or will just receive the additional airtime added to their bill.It is not clear whether customers of the networks that were also offline because they rely on O2\u0027s infrastructure – such as GiffGaff\u0026nbspand Tesco\u0026nbspMobile – will also be getting refunds from their carriers.The outage caused problems across the UK, including in some unusual places, such as live bus arrivals at bus stops, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata connection.It lasted for almost a full day, going down early in the morning and with service only being restored overnight the following evening.O2 said the issues were caused by problems with software provided by Ericsson. It also caused problems elsewhere in the world, such as at Japan\u0027s Softbank.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The oil producing nations had been expected to agree to a reduction in production on Thursday at its meeting in Vienna. Reaching a deal proved difficult as sanctions-hit Iran refused to comply with the output cuts, despite the input of non-Opec member Russia. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe stalemate led the oil price to fall - the commodity had previously dropped by 30 per cent from four-year highs of more than $86 per barrel in October to below $59 at the end of November. However, a second day of talks led to an agreement, providing a boost to the price of Brent crude which rose to $63.25 by mid-afternoon on Friday. Qatar to quit Opec in 2019 amid angry dispute with Saudi ArabiaWhat is OPEC and why has Qatar left its ranks?Trump hits out at OPEC and says oil prices are artificially very highWhy Opec is caught between a rock and a hard placeBarani Krishnan, senior analyst at Investing, said it was natural that oil traders would react as positively to Opec’s decision to cut production as they did negatively “when the group seemed powerless to reduce even a barrel”. He added: “However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly.”Mr Krishnan said the bigger takeaway is “what the Saudi energy minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today a Russia that has become as powerful to Opec as Riyadh and a US that is now a net exporter of oil”.Furthermore, we\u0027ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts,” he added. “One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.Donald Trump had called on Opec to leave production unfettered in order to weigh prices down, tweeting ahead of the Vienna meeting: “The world does not want to see… higher oil prices”. Meanwhile, Ashley Kelty, oil \u0026amp gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said that although cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day was a larger reduction than some had expected, it was still short of “what is really required to bring the market back into balance”. She said: “Our initial snap judgement is that prices will stabilise in the $60-65 per barrel range, as the cuts are likely to be insufficient to stem the near term supply glut, given US output is continuing to \u0026nbsprise (albeit at a slower pace due to capacity constraints).“It feels like a bit of a fudge, and the absence of the final communique at this late stage suggests that a lot of horse trading has been underway to reach a situation that tries to appeal to all parties, whilst ending up with a situation that will appease no-one.”Earlier this week, Qatar quit Opec, however, it still attended the meeting in Vienna.

Tory MPs don’t like it because we can’t get out of it except by signing a permanent trade deal that guarantees the same thing. Even Jeremy Corbyn has criticised it because we have no way out of it except with the agreement of the EU.\u0026nbspNow she could tell her MPs that avoiding a hard border in Ireland is something to which the UK should be committed anyway. But a lot of them don’t agree. They think it would be a price worth paying for a “real” Brexit – although they tend to argue in public that a hard border could be managed by technology so no one would notice it.\u0026nbspSo, instead, Theresa May is telling her rebels that they can have a veto over the backstop, should it ever be needed.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s backstop veto plan ‘would rip up withdrawal agreement’This is spin. She has written into the withdrawal agreement a choice at the end of the transition period, the end of 2020. If the long-term trade deal with the EU has not been negotiated by then, and it seems likely that it would not have been, the UK would then face a choice between the backstop or a one-off extension to the transition period. It would be inconceivable that any government would make that decision without consulting parliament, so May’s “offer” is no more than a statement of the obvious.\u0026nbspAnd it does not get round the fact that the backstop will still be the fallback option. If, in 2020, the UK opts to extend the transition period, at most by two years to the end of 2022, and if when that expires there is still no long-term trade deal, then the backstop will come into effect anyway.\u0026nbspThe only way out of it would be for the UK to repudiate the withdrawal agreement. This is an international treaty and we have a sovereign right as a nation to pull out of any treaty, but that would have serious consequences. Any country that goes around binning international agreements would become, in effect, a rogue state, and other countries will be wary of signing new deals with it. If we did that, it would not be possible to negotiate any kind of trade deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis was what many journalists and Brussels officials thought the prime minister meant by her offer: she would be giving MPs the chance to repudiate an agreement to which they had just agreed. That is the trouble with spin. If you are trying to pretend something is what it is not, people might assume you mean something else altogether.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is the sort of radical thinking this country needs to genuinely reconnect with the communities left behind by years of globalisation.Migration benefits our economy, but £4.7bn we receive every year from European migrants flows straight into government’s coffers in Westminster and austerity means communities like Redcar don’t see a penny. We should spend this money where it\u0027s really needed - outside of London and the South East - in communities that have not felt the benefits of an increasingly global economy.”Angela Smith, MP for Penistone and Stockbridge, added:\u0026nbspBrexit will do absolutely nothing to tackle the very real challenges faced by people in this country who have been badly affected by globalisation.We need a People\u0027s Vote to sort out the Brexit mess, but just as important is new thinking about how to tackle the biggest challenges faced by our communities. A Globalisation Fund, spending the idend from European migration in the places it\u0027s really needed, is one idea that would have a massive impact in parts of the country that have been hit by the decline of traditional industries and strangled by a decade of austerity.It comes as\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspprepare to vote on whether or not to accept Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.The Commons is widely expected to reject the proposal, prompting fresh calls for the public to be given a Final Say vote to break the deadlock in Parliament.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Salary and expense data posted in spreadsheets on the website of Albania’s Ministry of Finance show a wealth of details about the State Intelligence Service, including the locations of field offices, cash withdrawals, and minutiae such as the plumbers, technicians and mechanics they use. The records show the names and national identification card numbers of agents in the service, known locally and in the intelligence community as SHISH, operating inside Albania and abroad, including two with sensitive posts at Nato headquarters in Brussels.\u0026nbspThe spreadsheets disclose the names, positions, salaries and expenses of at least eight senior clandestine Albanian operatives – some working under diplomatic cover – in Belgium, Greece, Kosovo, Italy, Macedonia and Serbia.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Independent is not disclosing names or other identifying details to prevent retribution against low-level informants or others who may be associated with the agency’s operatives. Presented with the breach during a meeting in a café outside the agency’s heavily fortified Tirana compound, SHISH officials acknowledged the sensitive nature of the information.“The principle is that everything our agency does should be hidden, but we should follow all these rules and regulations,” said one SHISH official. “The rules and regulations don’t allow us to spend the money without reporting it.”Intelligence and security professionals told about the breach were stunned by the revelations, which could leave agents in sensitive positions vulnerable to surveillance or blackmail by hostile intelligence organisations or criminals seeking to infiltrate the Western alliance. “By getting into Albania’s system they can get into Nato’s system,” said Xhemal Gjunkshi, an opposition member of the Albanian parliament who serves on the National Security Commission and was a former Major-General in the army.\u0026nbsp“You start pulling a string and you end up in Brussels or London or the office of a supreme allied commander in the US.”Helidon Bendo, director of Albania’s State Intelligence Service, or SHISH\u0026nbsp(SHISH)A former CIA field operative familiar with SHISH described it as the type of bureaucratic catastrophe that could put lives at risk. “Your admin can screw you up if they’re not paying attention,” he told The Independent on condition of anonymity because he continues to work on sensitive security matters. “You can put the budget online. But to put the names and the other details of agents – that’s insanity.”A Brussels-based spokesperson for Nato said in an email that it does not comment on intelligence matters.Sigurimi, Albania’s Communist-era domestic spy service, at The House of Lives, a former intelligence headquarters now a museum in Tirana\u0026nbsp(Borzou Daragahi)SHISH is the successor organisation to the much feared Sigurimi, the notorious Communist-era domestic spy service that infiltrated every aspect of Albanians’ personal lives during the country’s four-and-a-half decade Stalinesque dictatorship. A 2007 US State Department cable published by Wikileaks described SHISH as “a professional, largely apolitical intelligence service” that is “excellent partners” with the US government and cited “close cooperation on all intelligence activities”.The director of the organisation, currently Helidon Bendo, is appointed by the prime minister but it operates as an autonomous unit outside of the Albanian cabinet. According to the finance ministry documents, it employs 913 people. One foreign diplomat complained that SHISH operates with little accountability or oversight. The documents revealed tantalising clues about the operations of the clandestine agency. The Independent could not confirm whether the names of the operatives inside Albania were handles or birth names. But the names of the international operatives listed matched the identities of Albanian diplomatic staff posted at embassies across Europe.One female regional operative in the main port city of Durrës, whose name and ID card number are visible in the records, is listed as withdrawing the Albanian currency equivalent\u0026nbspof\u0026nbsp£18,000, over at least 10 transactions this year for “special payments”, a possible reference to networks of informants.Another agent in Gjirokastër, in Albania’s south, is recorded withdrawing a cheque for about £1,500 in November for what is described on the Albanian ministry of finance’s public website as a “secret fund”. One set of 2017 payments, classified as secret, refers to a Nato communications system, referred to as Tumba, which might refer to several mountain peaks in the Balkans.At one point, water bills in Albania’s Himara district, where many members of the country’s Greek minority reside, suddenly drop 95 per cent, suggesting shifting surveillance priorities. The information appeared to be updated daily. A withdrawal of about £21,000\u0026nbspfrom Credins Bank in Tirana on 3 December was posted online by day’s end. Details include the licence plate numbers and sometimes make and model details of vehicles used by the spies, and even where the cars are taken for repairs, as well as records of pricey hotel stays and restaurant bills.Officials vowed to remove the data after The Independent informed the country’s prime ministry, intelligence services, foreign ministry, interior ministry, defence ministry and finance ministry publication of this article was pending. During the months the information has been online, it likely left the Nato country vulnerable to infiltration by operatives of Russian or other intelligence agencies. The country has already become something of a battleground as dominant pro-Western political leaders fend off the Kremlin’s agenda of weakening its Nato and EU ties. In March, Albania expelled two Russian diplomats, accusing them of unauthorised intelligence operations. “Their work did not correspond to their diplomatic status,” the foreign minister Ditmir Bushati said at the time.Albania appears to have repeatedly suffered from a lack of information security when it comes to its intelligence services. Last year the presidency\u0026nbspposted online an unredacted copy of SHISH director Mr Bendo’s national identification card, which includes his home address and ID number, as part of a transparency initiative.Earlier this year, a state agency reportedly was sent a list of 250 or so names of operatives serving in the country’s Military Intelligence unit. The SHISH documents posted online date back to 2014, as Albania struggled to show the EU that it had shaken off its history of public corruption and was seeking to be more transparent and accountable as a step towards membership in the trading and currency bloc.Albanian laws forbids the leaking of secret state information, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison for officials who ulge the intelligence and five years for ordinary citizens. Told of the leaks, officials of the prime minister’s office, finance ministry, interior ministry, and foreign ministry scrambled behind the scenes to remove the data, but also assign blame for the mishap. “The treasury registers on its online system all the bills and order of payments that are executed each day,” one official said on condition of anonymity. “All the details that are given there, are because they were written in the order of payment by the institution itself. They should have not detailed the bills with such sensitive information.”One longtime former officer of the Albanian intelligence service told The Independent that the culpability lay with SHISH itself, for handing sensitive information to finance ministry officials who lack security clearances.“It’s incompetence of the leadership,” said the former official, who spoke on condition he not be named discussing sensitive political issues. “Sometimes people are hired not because of good performance or qualifications, but because of the influence of the politicians. Sometimes people coming into the security institutions aren’t well vetted. The problem starts at the top.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004459005531-e1543889679409.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ofsted chief amanda spielman says schools are now being asked to do things that should be done by parents","story":"Watching kids in a classroom is great fun. Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why the apparent change of heart The popular consensus seems to be it’s a charm offensive to counteract the negative coverage of an alleged rt between her daughter Kate and royal newbie Meghan Markle — a laying out of the “Team Catherine” stall,you like.But as the fallout rumours are fairly recent and most glossy mags are laid out six weeks in advance, may I humbly cynicallysuggest that the stall she’s laying out might be more monetary than motherly In other words, building up traffic to her and husband Michael’s Party Pieces website for Christmas in preparation for potentially flogging it off to an overseas billionaire in the pre-Brexit New Year.But I digress. On Christmas Day I will be enduringour annual family fallout over a game of Monopoly. ButI wasn’t, I’d be straight round to Middleton Towers in Bucklebury, Berks, for what sounds like an idyllically festive few days.In a Christmas walnutshell, it goes something like this: Wake up whenever, pop in to the local church, go for a walk, open a few pressies, smoked salmon and champagne for lunch, more pressies, some games, then the main meal early evening.Oh, and all the grandchildren will have a small tree in their bedrooms that they can decorate themselves. The rest of the year, she says, “is really normal most of the time”. Which, to Prince William, who has grown up amid the pomp and circumstance of stuffy royal traditions, must feel like a slice of sheer heaven.Instead, poor love, he and Kate are expected to join the rest of the royalsat Sandringham, where the Queen et al stick to the German tradition of opening gts on Christmas Eve before dressing for a “formal dinner” from which, oh dear, the women eventually retire to another room while the men enjoy a port or brandy.Then it’s off to the highly publicised visit to St Mary’s Magdalene church on Christmas morning, followed by a turkey lunch and a communal viewing of “Granny’s” speech at pm.It’s unclear when William and Kate will head off to see her family, but what’s the betting they get in the car with fixed grins before mumbling “thank God that’s over for another year” the second they hit Norfolk’s A  And that’s why, whatever the truth behind the rumours that Kate and Meghan aren’t getting on, it won’t matter one jot to the admirably grounded Duchess of Cambridge who, thanks to her idyllic childhood, knows exactly who she is.Meghan, on the other hand, has no such cosy alternative to retreat to. Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable. But just like Kate did, it’s far better to quietly earn respect not noisily demand it.SUN writer Lynsey Clarke had the, er, pleasure of reporting on the opening night of Magic Mike Live at London’s Hippodrome casino.Thankfully, I was washing my hair that evening.For the show involves, horror of horrors, “audience participation”.  Not me, no sir-ee.Years ago, a friend booked a surprise stripper to turn up midway through my birthday dinner at a restaurant.But I clocked him the second he walked in, legged it out through the kitchens and refused tountil he’d safely vacated the premises.SHORTLY after Brit John Drennan proposed to Daniella Anthony during their trip to New York, the ring fell off her finger and into a drain.Their effort to retrieve the sparklerwas picked up on CCTV and went viral. I sympathise.Shortly after The Bloke proposed, I adjusted my sun lounger only for the ring to slip off my finger and into the sand.One hour laterI’d enlisted an army of baffled children brandishing their plastic sand sters on the promise of a free ice creamthey found it. Which they duly did, bless them.Thankfully, I have since put on at least a stone so now it doesn’t budge. CHASE star Anne Hegarty has pleaded with viewers of I’m A Celebrity to vote her out because she’s had enough.Someone should tell her that’s not how it works in the minds of the inherently mischievous Great British public.The merest whf of desperation to win will see you voted out early, while a genuine desire to leave ensures you’ll be stuck there to the end.IF ever there was an ad for the unconditional love and loyalty that accompanies dog ownership, then surely the photo of former US president George Bush Sr’s service dog Sully lying disconsolately next to his coffin is it CAROLINE FLACK’s surname is proving rather appropriate under the reportedly argumentative circumstances of her relationship with on-off fiance Andrew Brady.As I write, it’s apparently back on after he recently called the police during one of their seemingly regular spats.Each to their own and all that, but let’s hope Caroline isn’t kidding herself that these fallouts are merely a sign of their high-octane passion rather than the blatant incompatibility it so obviously is.In other words, the urge to fill empty places is greater than the desire to stop young people getting into crippling debt for certain degrees that prove virtually worthless in the jobs market.IT has emerged that former Prime Minister Clement Attlee secretly gave shelter to a Jewish refugee, who fled the Nazis ahead of the Second World War.Perhaps, in  years’ time, it will emerge that having promised in  to take in a refugee or two, Labour’s Yvette Cooper has been secretly doing so ever since SEX And The City producer Michael Patrick King has revealed that the feud between Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall dates back to the first ever series.He says that because Sarah was considered the bigger name at the time, she was paid more than the others – a set-up Kim remained unhappy with right to the end.He adds: “I guess for Kim it didn’t matter how much the raise becamethere was never parity, but there was never going to be parity.”Proof,needed, that often the pay gap between actors on a movie isn’t necessarily because of their gender but their box-office clout.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Likewise a second attempt.We suppose her Brexiter backbenchers and the DUP might suddenly buckle and back it rather than let Parliament’s Remainers impose something worse. Does that seem likely The PM’s best hope is surely to make the deal acceptable to them, by ditching the toxic Irish backstop or inserting a route out of the restrictive customs union it sets up. Admittedly, we cannot see the EU considering it. But who knows Labour are cock-a-hoop. Corbyn is measuring up the curtains in No.They will be toasting their friend, the “impartial” Commons speaker John Bercow: a verbose toad and diehard Remainer who choreographed the ­Government’s woes as payback for Labour overlooking the bullying scandal that should have cost him his job.But voters will remember a Labour Party that put its own interests first at a critical point in our national history.

The online system is riddled with faults, complications and delays.There can be no doubt, continuing with this roll-out will leave many of the most vulnerable families destitute by Christmas, and I am asking you to intervene as a matter of urgency.His area is currently seeing the full roll out of Universal Credit.But Amber Rudd blasted the letter as scaremongering.She said tonight: Theres no requirement for a UC claimant to have ID, butyou do purchase one we can actually reimburse you.Where people wont have ID our terric work coaches use many methods to identy someone and get their claim started right away.Many Brits have said they are finding the verication process online dficult - and hundreds of thousands of people have abandoned the online application because they couldnt finish it, recent figures revealed.Only half of claimants said they were able to make a claim online for benefits without help.IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.To apply for the new flagship benefits system you do need a form of ID - this can be a passport, credit card or a driving licence.ButBrits dont have this, there are other forms of ID that can be used - including evidence of your address, bills, a birth or marriage certicate, a National Insurance card, or council tax documents.Claimants can also be asked security questions too to try and very identities.Today it was revealed that the DWP has spent £million on adverts for Universal Credit.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: Having ID is not a requirement for those making a Universal Credit claim but it does make the process easier. If customers don’t have any ID we can reimburse the costthey choose to apply for a passport, driving licence or long birth certicate."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000000656820.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"callous voyeurs smartphone sneaks","story":"Virtuously they scold us for not being “woke” enough, not appreciating their values of ­liberated tolerance, and ­policing correctness in every word we say.We are “called out” as fascist fogeys at the slightest sign of expecting good manners, using an outdated word or thinking it sensible to know someone before you have sex with them.But among these free young spirits — not all, but far too many — there is a growing and unprecedented lack of care for the most basic human right: ­Privacy and respect.It seems that the smartphone is to blame. Suddenly, every berk thinks that the phone in their hand gives them the right to publish anything they see.Either they have some gung-ho fantasy of being a war correspondent, responsible for recording a fracas without doing a damn thing about stopping it. Or  in their head they are suddenly Quentin ­Tarantino, recording a particularly tasty bit of violence.So we get incidents like last week’s, at a Towie-favourite nightclub in Gants Hill, North East ­London. A young woman was filmed being sexually assaulted as onlookers, some of them women, jeer at the “fun” and point cameras up her skirt.Were these people scared of intervening and pulling the thugs off her, and filming it in order to pass the footage on to club management and police  Nope, they just put it up on the internet for the world to share the jeering. The weird and wicked idea that this is somehow OK is growing.Incidents on planes, in clubs, in the street, in schoolyards, are filmed by bystanders who don’t even try to shout or intervene. They are then plonked online, just to get some strange kudos for the person filming it.From the US and, increasingly, here there are cases of onlookers recording the humiliation of other people, not responsibly and ethically in order to give it to the authorities — managements, police, teachers — but just to put it online and “go viral”.Take the coward who last month filmed a policewoman being violently kicked in the head, then posted the footage online with the caption “LOL.” Or the bully who posted a video of a drunk teen ­giving oral sex to more than  men in Magaluf, for the “banter”.And last week, a shocking video of a -year-old Syrian refugee boy called Jamal being dragged to the floor by his neck went viral. Then, because the poor boy has not been humiliated enough, his ordeal was shared online by “disgusted” celebs and MPs who proclaim to care but are, of course, unwittingly ­contributing to his suffering.Some may vaguely think they are activists exposing bad ­behaviour, but in cases like this they are no such thing. They are voyeurs, cowards, and exhibitionists. Because it’s the victim of the attack, not just the attackers, who gets humiliated.Anyone half-decent understands that only disgusting ­people go in for “revenge porn”, sharing intimate videos of someone they broke up with. Whether dumped or cheated on, that is a horrible thing to do and can make the victim suicidal. Young girls live in terror of it, on one hand encouraged to be sexy and on the other scared of having their most unguarded moments exposed to the world.It has, a few times, led to ­prosecution and so it should. But personal vengeance and associated “slut-shaming” is only part of it.The whole business of filming other people without consent needs to be seen for what it is — a form of unregulated, potentially irresponsible and damaging rogue journalism.  Smartphone tech and the internet should be ­governed by the same ethical rules journalism developed.Good editors pixelate faces and agonise about what is responsible reporting, and what is in the ­public interest.If it would be wrong for a news reporter to film, for no good ­reason, a person being humiliated, assaulted, or even just tumbling in the street or falling asleep in an embarrassing position on a train, then it is even more wrong for any selfish git with a smartphone to do it.Journalism has rules because it is public. Now that technology can make anyone’s instant shot just as public, the rules should be the same. And because the technology belongs to the “digital natives” who grew up with it, it is time they applied to it all those pious, ethical modern values which we hear so much about.Not all slut-shamers and gloating video bystanders are young — but a great many are. It’s the job of the new ­generation to invent and support a digital morality.What’s the point being a ­liberated, gay-friendly, vegan-conscious, no-ing snowflakeyou’re not willing to call out callous voyeurs and smartphone sneaks Libby Purves is a former presenter of Radio ’s Today programme.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this lot beats them all.Two years ago we had a vote on whether we wanted to stay in the European Union. The outcome was decisive.By  per cent to  per cent we voted to leave. The people had been given a voice.And the people said very clearly: We want to leave.But there was never a majority among our political class for leaving.tp composite more brexitBecause for two years the Remainer majority of MPs has done everything it possibly can to thwart the will of the people.They have undermined Theresa May and the Government when it tried to negotiate with Brussels.That’s the main reason the deal we have before us now is so weak.Because as soon as ministers set off to do battle, the likes of Philip Hammond and Justine Greening would be trying to pull the rug from under their feet.The biggest deceit is this. All the while these politicians are trying to scupper Brexit, they are putting on their sincere faces and saying: “We must respect the will of the people.”This is a downright lie and it has always been a downright lie.When Tory Remainers tell you we must get a good deal, they really mean we must not leave the European Union.When the Labour Party tells you that we must have a “good Brexit for jobs”, they really mean that we must not leave the European Union.When that coffin-faced bore Dominic Grieve, once our Attorney General, puts down amendments which effectively stop us leaving with a no-deal, he is really saying: “We must not leave the European Union under any conditions at all.”When they start lecturing you about how Parliament must be sovereign — they’re saying the same thing. We must not leave the EU.What has happened over the past two years has been a concerted campaign of treachery and betrayal.The Tory Brexiteers — with one or two exceptions, such as David Davis, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg — haven’t helped by being a disorganised rabble.Too interested in their own political careers to do the dficult work of leading Britain towards a confident exit from that authoritarian bureaucracy.But it is the Remainers who have done the real damage.If they didn’t tell us, at every step of the way, that “the people’s vote must be respected” then I’d have a little more time for them. But they trot that out every time they open their mouths.All the while trying to wreck any chance of Brexit.God knows what will happen now. Although I suspect even he’s perplexed.What should have been a graceful and confident exit from an unfit institution has turned into a bugger’s muddle.But I do know this. The people of the UK will not forget the names of those who have sold us down the river.And one day, sure enough, we’ll have our revenge.What’s advertised as a glistening winter wonderland is usually five square yards of mud with a plastic donkey and an elf who has just completed a five stretch for armed robbery.I know everybody needs to make a ­living. But I do wonder how the owners of these crap grottos live with themselves.Find eight of the best Winter Wonderlands here.WHAT a fabulous family the Osamors are.A real credit to the country, to the Labour Party and to the House of Commons.Let’s start with Kate, above, the Labour MP for Edmonton and one of Jeremy ­Corbyn’s favourites.She employed her son, Ishmael, below, as a researcher at the House of Commons.And continued to do so even after he had been convicted of possessing lethal drugs including ketamine and ecstasy at a festival.Not only that, but she misled the public and her colleagues.She said she hadn’t known about her son’s conviction until after he was sentenced.When it was absolutely clear that she had.How did she respond when a journalist tried to ask her about this business She screamed “f*** off” at him. Then threw a bucket of water at him.Then said: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your head in.”After which, this entitled madam actually rang  – twice – to say the reporter was “stalking” her.Unbelievable.Then there’s  Grandma Osamor, Kate’s mother Martha. Now ennobled as Baroness Osamor of Tottenham and taking her seat in the House of Lords at your expense.A supporter of Labour activists suspended over anti-Semitism.And once considered too left-wing even for the Labour Party, until Corbyn came along.What a great parenting job both she and her daughter have done.And do you suppose that either would be in the ­positions they are now were it not for the colour of their skin THE animal rights activists Peta want us to stop using  certain phrases which are nasty about animals.Such as, “No use flogging a dead horse”.Better to say: “You can’t feed a fed horse.” Which doesn’t sound right at all, to me.Some vegans are also supposedly  objecting to “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because it’s unkind to eggs. And “bringing home the bacon”. Which is unkind to bacon.I think we need to create a few new ones to annoy Peta even further. So . . .Too many voles in the blender spoil the smoothie.Riots, confusion, mayhem. They’ve just woken up to the fact that their president is a smirking liberal halfwit who cares not a jot about working-class people.  We could have told you that, mes amis, when you elected him  months ago.Emmanuel Macron has already had to climb down and give in to some of the demands from the rioters.During the election he portrayed himself as a populist, but was anything but. It was a con job.Next time you toddle off to the polls, you lot, get it right.SO, Nigel Farage has deserted Ukip because he thinks the party has become too extremist.Fair enough, he’s probably right. The party looks dead and buried.It’s a shame that because of our first-past-the-post system Ukip were never able to capture many seats in parliament.I’ve never been a fan of proportional representation.Butwe had it, Ukip under Farage, above, would likely be our second or third biggest party by now.And those negotiations over  Brexit would be looking very dferent, wouldn’t they RESPECT to Wrexham driver Kenneth Samuels. He managed to fit ELEVEN people into his Ford Focus.Actually, he’s a Wrexham non-driver now, because the Old Bill caught him.  He was disqualied from driving for  months.I assumed at first that he was ferrying a troupe of dwarves to a panto.But no. There were children involved, which kind of antagonised the magistrates.If the police had looked a bit further I suspect they’d have found the entire Liberal Democrat Party in the boot.  And Speaker John Bercow in the glove box. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didnt know what to think.An ice pancake is a type of ice that is in round pieces that range from being  centimetres in diameter to three metres. Ice pancakes are formed in two ways. One way is that is formed on water and covers slush or grease ice. Another way is that it is created by breaking ice rind, which is a shiny crust of floating ice.I was loader on the lorry that day and we have to go up the Strath Road that runs along the river then we go back in the same direction.I went down river bank to have a look as I had never seen these before.It was clearly ice but I couldnt figure out how the pancakes had formed so I had to do some research.I had no idea they were so rare, but Id never seen anything like them.As far as Ive read, theyre caused by foam freezing and bouncing off other bits of frozen foam."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000454631359.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"portrait of humanity photos 2018","story":"From Irish travellers to a drter with his dog in Los Angeles and cousins growing up in Argentina, the photographs show a range of unique characters.They are the latest entries for Portrait of Humanity, an international award that invites photographers of all levels to submit images expressing iniduality, community and unity.To take part, you must submit your pictures before January , .The  winning images will be exhibited in galleries and museums around the world from September  to January .Heres a selection of some of the stunning entries so far.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Keep your eyes peeled.”There are some things Brits can do to keep the pests away that include keeping a clean home, making a homemade repellent, spotting and fixing leaky pipes and taps, and getting a dehumidier to keep the moisture away.A repellent can be made using equal parts vinegar and water, a squirt of washing up liquid and then mix it with  drops of peppermint and eucalyptus oil, Gohri adds.A silverfish is a small, wingless insect that is light grey in colour that imitates fish-like movements.Silverfish are attracted to food residue and moisture.The pests love pasta and cereals and it is recommended all food is kept in sealed containers.They can enter homes through leaky pipes and taps.If the home is already crawling with silverfish making honey and salt traps can catch them.Gohri said to mix honey and baking soda onto a piece of cardboard to attract them, trap them and then dehydrate and kill them from the salt.Silverfish also hate the smell of garlic, lemon, lavender and oranges."},{"url":null,"title":"karen danczuk split from toyboy","story":"Karen - once married to shamed former MP Simon Danczuk - was due to tie the knot in Spain next year with boyfriend David Escudero.

Senior figures there say that will not be decided until Monday.But they do admit they are making little headway in trying to quell this rebellion, and that they are heading for a loss.How big  “I’m sure it’ll breach three figures”, one Cabinet minister says of the margin of defeat.A way to avoid such a humiliation would be to find an amendment that could pass the Commons.This means there would be no vote on May’s deal as it currently stands, enabling the Government to argue that it hadn’t actually been defeated.Though, as one source admits, voters would be left baffled by this procedural trick.This approach isn’t guaranteed to work either.First of all, it would rely on John Bercow selecting the amendment — which is far from certain. The Speaker is supposed to be impartial, but Bercow has long used his power to cause the Government trouble.Much of Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting was taken up with ministers complaining about him. Liam Fox, the Trade ­Secretary, called Bercow “a disgrace to his office”.Also, some Tory rebels are itching to defeat the Government. They are discussing whether to vote against ALL amendments, regardless of whether they agree with them or not, so they can make clear their opposition to May’s deal. Some in Cabinet think thatMPs voted for an amendment setting out what would make the deal acceptable to Parliament, it would strengthen May’s hand with the EU.One tells me: “The negotiation has been all about us saying yes or no. This would make the EU say yes or no to something.”Chancellor Philip Hammond, though, argued at Thursday’s inner Cabinet that any concessions are more likely to come after a vote has been lost — so there was a case for pressing on.What May thinks the way ahead is remains unclear even to her inner Cabinet, much to their frustration.“The main problem is that it is very dficult to read the PM,” one tells me, adding that, “Until she decides what she wants to do, it is very dficult to put weight behind any ­particular outcome.”Backbench Tory MPs are also becoming increasingly irritated with her.One senior figure who is ­normally sympathetic complains that she has become “completely messianic about the backstop”. This source says that Tory MPs “want to hear a solution rather than this is the only choice and they’re stupid”.Allies of May are deeply pessimistic about the EU offering any meaningful concessions.Their view is that the EU thinks that the alternatives to May’s deal are either a softer Brexit or a second referendum, so it has little incentive to offer much up.Not everyone in the Cabinet is so sure.One senior minister, with Prime Ministerial ambitions, has been explaining to junior ministers in detail how they could negotiate a better deal on the backstop.Tory leadership contenders are readying themselves.They calculate thatthe vote goes ahead this week May will lose by a big margin, the  letters will then go in and May could well lose that vote of confidence, triggering a contest.If she does go ahead with Tuesday’s vote, she’ll be betting her premiership on keeping the margin of defeat respectable. It would be a mighty gamble.There are two reasons for this. First, the Labour front bench are not keen on Norway-Plus and a number of those on the Labour benches who did support it have moved to backing a second ­referendum. Second, there is now more Tory opposition to it than there was before, particularly among the Cabinet.One Secretary of State warns that a Norway Plus deal “would destroy the Conservative Party forever”.The problem is that in an effort to make the plan acceptable to the Europeans, it has gone from being a temporary solution that would give the UK time to negotiate a free trade deal with the  EU to an indefinite arrangement that involves accepting the withdrawal agreement and with  it the ­backstop. This all makes it much less ­acceptable to Brexiteers.Even those in the Cabinet who are sympathetic to the idea admit that it would face problems.One tells me: “I am not sure it is possible because so many people would trash it.”Norway-Plus would also require a new leader.Those close to May say she could not endorse a deal that did not end free movement.EVENthe Government loses heavily on Tuesday, it would still survive a vote of confidence.The Tory rebels and the DUP have been clear that they would vote for the Government in that debate.This poses a dilemma for Labour.It means that any attempt to bring down the Government would fail, and risk providing a rare moment of Tory unity. I understand, though, that opposition parties have been mulling a dferent approach – a censure motion in the PM.This would allow the House to express its disapproval of May’s handling of Brexit, without bringing down the Government.The thinking is that this might persuade the DUP to support it.  It would demonstrate that without them, the Government cannot win a confidence vote.Traditionally, these censure motions have been accompanied by a cut in salary for the minister concerned. But there are worries on the Opposition benches that such an approach could backfire because it would look too personal.So,the UK couldn’t now leave without a deal without facing catastrophic consequences, who should carry the can for that ONE theory doing the rounds this week is that May could resign as PM and advise the Queen to ask her de facto deputy, David Lidington, to form a government.This government would then, so the thinking goes, move towards a Norway-style deal.But I am told there would be resignations from the Cabinetthis happened, and a leading Tory backbencher warns that such a government would not be able to command the confidence of the House.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jurors heard how the Birmingham man was involved in a pound, personalised number plate scam along with his brothers, Aamir Khan and Ayan Ahmed, as well as their cousin, Zubair Ahmad. The group targeted Scottish lottery winner, Gillian Bayford, who won pound million in . Hours after he left the UK in June, as his trial at Birmingham Crown Court was coming to an end, he posted a video on social media saying: Sorry, I had no choice, Birmingham Live reports. The men were all found guilty of conspiracy to defraud, and were sentenced to  years in prison on Friday.   Birmingham Crown Court heard Khan, , lived a playboy lestyle and may have married up to three dferent women in Muslim ceremonies, as well as having numerous affairs. But as the case was coming to a close in June the fraudster fled the UK after being granted bail by the judge. His passport was not confiscated. He is now a wanted fugitive after being sentenced to ten years for the fraud. Zahid Khan and brother Aamir have also both received additional -month sentences for smuggling illegal immigrants into the UK. Zahid Khan had also lied on four separate car insurance policies – failing to disclose his criminal convictions, licence points and CCJ’s against him – in order to obtain cheaper cover.   Detective Constable Rob Piper, from West Midlands Police’s Economic Crime Unit, said police realised Khan may have absconded when he did not turn up for court as the original trial was coming to an end in June. “We conducted some enquiries and discovered that he had left the country,” he said. The officer added: “Khan has an absolutely huge ego and believes he can treat anyone as he wishes. Khan had publicly pretended to be a caring and wealthy businessman who donated to the homeless and refugees. In reality he was a serial criminal who enjoyed fast cars, speedboats, race horses - and ‘marrying’ up to three women. He had also posed for pictures with rappers and boxers, including Floyd Mayweather when the US champion visited the UK. A Ferrari he claimed was worth pound, was actually a former write-off and was unroadworthy. It was seized and crushed by police.   And smooth-talking Khan’s greed and arrogance was the undoing of him and his family gang. He tried to mastermind the pound, fraud by registering five existing personalised number plates with the DVLA under his own name and those of relatives - to then sell them on. One of the victims targeted was lottery Gillian Bayford, who orced husband Adrian  months after their Euromillions win.   She was targeted for her personalised number plate G, while another victim’s plate - C - was worth pound,. Khan, from Yardley Wood Road in Moseley, had initially sold one ‘stolen’ personalised registration plate - K - for pound,. But his downfall began when he tried to sell the G plate to a Black Country firm. They called in police after they had contacted Gillian about her potentially buying G – only to be told it was already adorning a car on her driveway. Detectives began a painstaking investigation and they uncovered evidence which smashed the elaborate plot. They discovered that Khan ‘pressured’ an Audi salesman into handing over confidential car buyer details, including home addresses and crucial chassis numbers. Officers called in handwriting experts to prove the crooked DVLA forms were filled in by dad-of-three Khan, while voice analysts identied him as making calls to the DVLA. Det Con Piper, who brought the gang to justice, said: “Zahid Khan was the one skilled in this fraud. He had identied this fraud through his criminal brain and his heavy involvement in the criminal industry and then enlisted the help of his two brothers and cousin. “All of the defendants refused to provide handwriting samples. But we obtained Zahid Khan’s passport application and found that forged documents were all completed by the same person - and they matched the handwriting on his passport application.” Khan, who also went by the alias Adam Hussain, had pressured the Audi salesman – from whom he’d previously bought a vehicle – to harvest details on drivers with valuable plates. He then contacted DVLA purporting to be the rightful owner, claiming to have lost the log book and reporting an address change. And when Khan ed the new log book, sent out in the genuine owner’s name but to his home address, he was able to claim ownership of the plates by naming himself or one of his co-conspirators as the ‘grantee’ on V retention documents.   During the investigation West Midlands Police also uncovered evidence linking him to six stolen cars being run on  plates. In December  he was caught behind the wheel of a VW Golf bearing cloned plates and the following February a Vauxhall van he’d bought was found displaying VRMs, suggesting it was two years younger than its manufacture date. The following December, -year-old Aamir Khan tried selling two Audi As and a Range Rover Evoque on behalf of his older brother – but the auction house refused to offer him sale lots and reported their suspicions over the vehicles’ identities to police. Their fears were confirmed when officers found all three were sporting bogus number plates and police also discovered that, in May , Aamir Khan swapped another stolen Evoque at a Birmingham car yard for an Audi A before Zahid sold it on the following day. Khan and his brother Aamir tried covering their tracks by manufacturing a series of text messages between themselves that they sent to a supposed rogue car dealer, called Paul Plates, after buying a dummy phone. Det Con Piper said: “This number was saved in Zahid and Aamir’s phones under the name Paul Plates. “We believe and our case is that those messages were created to act as a ersion for as and when the police come knocking on their door.” Khan later also claimed to police he had been sold the personalised plates by an old school friend, who was entirely innocent. But when asked to provide contact details he said they had been lost in a mystery arson attack at his Bulls and Horses car business in Stratford Road, Sparkhill, in February . No-one has ever been caught for the alleged arson attack - despite Khan offering a pound, reward at the time after blaming the fire on ‘jealous rivals’. Det Con Piper said: “Zahid Khan portrayed the image of a legitimate businessman and a multi-millionaire…but in reality he is a career criminal and a con artist. “He and his family and associates clearly thought they had identied a scheme that could make them signicant sums of money: the five VRMs they had stolen the rights for had a combined value of half a million pounds. “However, we uncovered the scam and he has rightly now been convicted for leading this criminal gang.” .................................................................................................................................... DEFENDANTS AND SENTENCES: *Zahid Khan, , was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud, perverting the course of justice, plus concealing and converting criminal property.

Neville’s lawyer said he may have been worried about inheritance tax and future care home fees and had signed shypapers that his son had presented to him. The older man was described as having shy“eccentricities” including a fear of using electronic devices or bank cards. The court was also told Neville, who wore a high vis jacket at the hearing, had lived in a car for two years after ending an earlier marriage in . His lawyer said his client, a dad of four, had been given a hearing aid so he could listen to the evidence properly.

One Hull mum fears the decision made by staff at the Hull primary school is down to laziness, with many parents gutted they wont see their children take to the stage. All key stage one pupils have been excluded from the annual tradition, despite complaints from a number of parents, Hull Live reports. However the schools head has defended the move, saying children still have a number of opportunities to celebrate the festive season. Mum-of-five, Carla Fernie, says her son has been quiet and subdued after realising he will not be performing in front of his family.  She said: All the parents are saying that it helps with their confidence but they [the school] are not getting it. Not doing it means they’re all missing out. “I’ve been speaking to a girl that goes to Stoneferry and they’re doing it. I know others at Gillshill and Buckingham Primary who do it too. “If they’ve got cousins in other schools then they’re all seeing them do the outfits but they don’t get to do that. They’re all missing out. “I just think it’s lazinessthe teachers won’t do it. I know they work hard but it’s quite sad.” Ms Fernie’s youngest son, Frankie, took part in a school nativity in  when he was in the early years foundation stage but won’t get the same chance this time around. She claims that all the school used to do Christmas performances before a new head teacher was appointed a couple of years ago.  Parents have been posting their upset online about not being able to see their children in action. Another mum said: “I remember as my cousins little boy did it last year, I’m gutted now. It’s like well why has it stopped.” A third parent added that she feels “sad that some are missing out”. “I know all of the children work hard, but things like plays and trips are things the kids enjoy and get excited about and I feel sad that some are missing out,” she said. Ms Fernie says she “felt sad” to see a post on Hull Live’s Family News page asking for pictures of nativities taking place in schools because it reminded her that her son was missing out. In a statement, Deborah Tague, head teacher at Westcott Primary said: “At Westcott Primary we try and make sure the children have as many opportunities as possible to celebrate Christmas. “We put on a Foundation Stage Nativity Performance and continue to do this as we feel this is important to our school community. “Pupils will also be wrapping presents for family members at a Christmas Wrap event, visiting a pantomime at the Freedom Centre, going Christmas Carol signing in the community, attending a Carol Service at St Columba’s Church and having a Christmas dinner and party. We’ve even got a Christmas jumper day. “Christmas is very important to Westcott and we look forward to celebrating the festive season with pupils and parents.” "},{"url":null,"title":"identical twin babies dress up","story":"NewsIdentical twins dress up for first Christmas – one parents feared they’d not seePoppy and Jessica Jennions battled for le for seven weeks after docs diagnosed transfusion syndromeShareCommentsByAlison Smith-Squire:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsPoppy and Jessica Jennions dress up to celebrate their first Christmas \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIdentical twins Poppy and Jessica Jennions dress up to celebrate their first Christmas – one their parents feared they’d never see. First they needed laser surgery in the womb at just  weeks after docs diagnosed transfusion syndrome. Each was draining the other of vital nutrients and blood. The op could kill them – but without it parents Lauren,  and Phillip, , knew both would die. Surgery at St George’s Hospital, London, was a success – but in August the twins arrived  weeks premature. Poppy was Ib oz and Jessica lb oz. They battled for le for seven weeks. Lauren, of Havant, Hants, said: “After everything they’ve been through Poppy and Jessica are just little miracles. “There were so many times Philip and I thought we’d lose our daughters. This is the dream family Christmas we feared we might not see.  The couple were delighted when at their first scan they discovered it was identical twins. Says Lauren, who has a twin brother, “I’d never heard of this syndrome. But I was worried when at an  week scan I was told there was a slight dference in the amniotic sacs and I would be monitored for it. “Four days later I knew it was serious when my tummy suddenly grew and I put on two kilos overnight.” Lauren was urgently referred to London’s St George’s Hospital where doctors said they needed to operate immediately to break shared blood vessels. Jessica was receiving a larger share of the blood supply and nutrients putting a strain on her heart. Meanwhile poppy was being starved of blood which was also straining her heart. “Devastatingly surgery could kill them but without it both babies would die,” says Lauren, “Poppy had no visible bladder and barely any fluid around her whereas Jessica had too much fluid causing her heartbeat to overwork.”  The delicate laser surgery to seal off the defective blood vessels involved inserting a camera and laser directly into the uterus. “At one point the camera went through Jessica’s sac to drain the fluid and she lted a tiny hand in a wave. Poignantly it made me realise how bonded I was to them.” The next  hours were crucial to seethe babies would survive. Thankfully a scan a week later showed the girls were thriving. The couple looked forward to enjoying the rest of the pregnancy. But their babies had other ideas. “At  weeks and six days weeks I was having a meal to celebrate going on maternity leave when my waters broke in the restaurant,” recalls Lauren. Philip rushed his we to hospital where an hour later she gave birth to Poppy, weighing Ib oz. Four minutes later Jessica, ib oz, arrived. The girls were immediately taken to specialist neonatal units at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. “I only saw the tops of their hats as they were wheeled out,” recalls Lauren. “It was five hours before we saw them properly and a week before we could hold them.” The next seven weeks were stressful as the girls battled to breathe on the own. “Finally bringing them home was amazing, evenwe did have to carry portable oxygen tanks with us for a while,” says Lauren. Since then the girls have tripled their birth weights. Says proud dad Phillip: “They are such stubborn little fighters. Jessica is smiling and they often reach out to touch one another and hold hands.” The couple plan a big family Christmas with grandparents when on December th the twins will celebrate their four month birthday. Says Lauren: “It’s going to be extra special. For a long time we couldn’t think as far ahead as Christmas. We were just grateful for every day they survived. “Having Poppy and Jessica are the best Christmas presents. We’re so lucky to have them.”Lauren and Phillip are raising money for neonatal units at Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, and St Richards, Chichester.

Newlyweds Meghan and Harry will reportedly not spend Christmas with Kate and William following rumours of a rt between the sisters-in-law. It was thought the frostiness between the Royal Fab Four had been caused by disagreements between to two Duchesses. But new revelations suggest it’s actually the BROTHERS increasingly strained relationship that’s at the heart of the ision. Harry is even believed to have accused his older brother of trying to wreck his relationship with US actress Meghan.  The rumours come just two weeks after Harry and Meghan unveiled plans to move out of Kensington Palace - where the Cambridges also live - and relocate to Windsor instead. From the two young boys once united by tragedy, to rivals increasingly ided in love, things have never been worse between the pair, The Sun reports. According to the source, Diana’s boys started squabbling back in  when -year-old Meghan first began dating Harry, . Prince William is said to be incensed by his younger brother’s over-protectiveness of Meghan and his failure to see reason with her. “He will brook absolutely no criticism of Meghan — and he is so sensitive he often sees criticism or negativity where there isn’t any,” a source told The Sun.  Just as any other brothers, the pair have a long history of tfs, tantrums and sibling rivalries. William, , was said to be furious with Harry back in  when he was secretly filmed stripping naked in a Las Vegas hotel room. The pair are also notorious for teasing one another about who’s got the least hair, and who’s the better soldier. But more famous than their fallings out was their unity in through the toughest times. And now that bond is now said to be hanging by a tether.  The first of the threads allegedly snapped after William was first introduced to Meghan, and, shortly afterwards, offered Harry some unwelcome brotherly advice. Knowing his brother to be glitzy-eyed for the American actress, William is said to have warned his brother to take it slowly. A Sun source close to the Royal Family has said: “William told his brother they knew nothing about her background, her intentions, what she was really like. “He just wanted to stress that becoming part of the Royal Family is a massive undertaking and the pressure and scrutiny is unrelenting. Was Meghan the right one  “Harry went mental, he accused his brother of trying to finish his romance before it had begun. The brothers’ relationship has not really recovered.”  However, it’s said William wasn’t the only to voice his concerns over Meghan, with similar sentiments echoing down from the upper echelons of the monarchy. Another courtier said: “A lot of people in the family objected. Who really knows what the concerns were  Was it Meghan’s background  Her father and dreadful half-sister  Because she was an outspoken American  Divorced  “Harry stood up for Meghan very forcibly. He really loves her.” The Middleton’s were also slow to reach out a hand to Harry’s signicant other, who voiced concerns over inviting Meghan to Pippa’s wedding last May, in fear she’d overshadow the bride-to-be’s big day. Eventually she was asked but only opted to attend the evening reception.  Hoping to make amends when she moved to London last November, engaged to Harry, Meghan reportedly tried desperately to integrate herself with her in-laws. Hoping to be taken under Kate’s wing, the Princess was left disappointed to find Kate - suffering from motion sickness from her pregnancy with Louis, and looking after George and Charlotte - too busy to spend time with her. A royal source said: “Meghan hoped Kate would show her the ropes. But, equally understandably, Kate was busy. She didn’t have as much time for her as Meghan would have liked. They were at very dferent places in their lives. “Meghan felt quite let down. She had really tried but felt rebuffed, and so just stopped trying.” Harry did not take this lightly and spoke to William about making Meghan feel welcome. William, however, took his we’s side.

You cant be blamed for deciding its not worth buying a mountain of potatoes and enough party food to sink a battleship. If you decide its time to take a breather in the cafe and tuck into a Christmas dinner you dont have to cook yourself, you might wonder which of the supermarkets has the best offering. Lucky for you, the Manchester Evening News has tried and tested them - with a mixed bag of results. Morrisons It would appear the Morrisons cafe is the most in-demand in the city, reports Emily Heward. Theres a half hour wait on food and a bum on nearly every seat when we arrive on a Friday lunchtime, so we decide to go away and come back later. The queues died down a bit but theres still a -minute wait when we . The menu sounds promising, as supermarket caffs go. Alongside the traditional turkey dinner theres a veggie version with a caullower cheese tart, a salmon thermidor or a turkey and stuffing roll, plus a selection of starters.   We order a turkey and a veggie dinner and settle in to a booth with a view of the car park, where I once saw a man practising his saxophone scales in a trolley bay. Twenty minutes later, a harried-looking kitchen worker comes over to tell us theres no caullower cheese tarts left. Back the veggie goes to re-join the queue and change her order for a beetroot burger. While shes waiting the kitchen worker reappears with my turkey dinner - along with an unbidden plate of dry potatoes and veg, which apparently now constitutes the vegetarian option. He places a jug of gravy beside it, hesitantly. Its meat gravy, so I dont knowshell want it, he said. The floury roast potatoes behave like a particularly absorbent sponge and sap all the moisture out of your mouth, though the seasoning is almost there. They are definitely helped along with a drizzle of gravy - a liberal spread of cranberry sauce has to suffice for the vegetarian  The mash is better than the roasties but the veg... Oh, the veg. It would appear the whole half hour wait has been spent slowly boiling it into oblivion. The turkey is unnervingly brown, even underneath the gravy which is splashed all over the plate like a massacre. I show the picture to two friends later, independently of one another. Is that a dead squirrel  both asked. The buttery meat flakes like tuna at the prod of a fork. It tastes marginally better than it looks but thats the best we can say for it.

MS This Christmas dinner reminds us of the film Love Actually - featuring a few star turns from the likes of Emma Thompson and Bill Nighy , interspersed with some dismal performances from Keira Knightley and the annoying boy who learns the drums . The meat was salty and tender, with a good quality gravy whichdidn’t taste like it had come from a Bisto tin. The roast potatoes were crispy and soft on the inside, reports Rebecca Day. The stuffing was the highlight - rich and meaty, with a strong taste of sage.   And the cranberry sauce was delightful - zingy and sweet. The vegetables were a bit disappointing - the carrots and sprouts tasted overcooked. No one likes a soggy sprout. The Yorkshire puddingwas pretty average as well - the texture was spongy rather than light and pillowy. Activating full festive mode, we ordered a gingerbread lattetoo. The mountain of whipped cream on top was unnecessarily indulgent, making it more of a dessert than a drink. It’s the type of coffee that would leave an Italian connoisseur squirming. I downed it before I even started the meal which was ill-advised as I was stuffed full of cream and sugar before even embarking on the main event. But - Christmas.   At pound., the food isn’t cheap - especiallyyou’re nipping in for a bite to eat during a shopping trip. Paying pound. in total for a meal and drink seems a bit extravagant, pushing up towards pub lunch prices. The MS cafe on Exchange Square is absolutely heaving when I visit on a Tuesday lunchtime but the staff are prepared for it, operating like a well-oiled machine. When I arrive in the queue I’m greeted by a cafe assistant who makes small talk before politely guiding me to the till. After making my order I’m handed a tracker which alerts members of staff to my whereabouts when the food is prepared. Theres no messing about. There’s a calm and comforting ambiance to an MS cafe which is hard to replicate where. I feel like my heart rate instantly drops when I enter, despite it being so busy. I’m surrounded by elderly people and young families having a nice natter. Ahhhh, I could sit here all day. Very British.   Asda When I arrive at Asda to test out its menu, I quickly find the shop has just an Express Diner, reports Matthew Cooper. What does that mean  - I reply. It means they don’t serve the whole Asda cafe menu. In fact, they don’t serve much by the looks of what’s on offer. There are two pizzas sitting on hot plates and a box of chips further down the counter which are sitting in a puddle of their own condensation inside their box. What they ARE selling is the Christmas dinner pizza, which is topped with turkey chunks, stuffing cubes, gigantic pigs in blankets and cranberry sauce. It costs pound for the entire pizza or pound. for a hefty slice and it’s hard to argue with that price. I’ll take one. Except they dont have any to hand, so I have to sit and wait while they chuck one in the oven for me.   I find a seat in the predominantly empty dining area waiting room, although I’m not sure what the people scattered round are waiting for, except for the world to pass them by. Or for the staff to cook their pizzas maybe. There is an eerie silence present and the predominant sound is the low buzzing of the lights and a distant frenzy of shoppers in the background buying mince pies by the dozen. Other than that it’s dead air. Then my two slices of pizza turn up. Christmas dinner on a pizza is a great idea on paper, but then so is socialism. How much melted cheddar do you have over your dinner on Christmas Day  Probably not much, that’s because the two don’t pair up particularly well. There’s also no cranberry sauce to be seen, so essentially what I have are certain parts of a Christmas feast stuck to a cheese base like velcro. I ask for a second opinion from the pigeon that’s been skulking around by throwing it a cube of turkey. It approves. If it’s good enough for a garbage dove it’s good enough for me - especially at pound. a slice.   Tesco How does a supermarket ensure theyre not going to ruin a perfectly good roast dinner  Well, dont try and make a roast dinner in the first place, reports Daisy Jackson. Tesco have shunned the conventional meat-and-five-veg-and-some-more-meat-wrapped-inside-another-meat format and instead stuck to a cafe offering, with a selection of festive paninis, toasties and sandwiches and some syrup-laden hot drinks too. Yeah, you heard that right - festive panini. Theres the pigs under blankets paniniwhich is served with a Bechemal sauce , a ham hock and piccalilli sandwich , and a brie and cranberry toastie . What makes these dferent from the sandwiches lined up in the fridges downstairs is that these ones are crushed inside a panini press before you eat them.   Nothing screams Christmas quite like a flat, warm baguette, eh  There are a few sarnies served at room temperature, such as a Christmas staple of turkey, stuffing and bacon . The verdict is Basic, but actually quite nice. On to the hot stuff, and that brie and cranberry toastie. Asa sandwich stuffed with cheese wasnt quite enough, one slice of the bread here is topped with a melted cheese crust, like a croque monsieur. Its a nice touch in principal, but in reality its complete overkill. The process of warming it back up again creates a weirdly salty cheese crisp, like the sort of thing that forms in the bottom of your oven when your cheese on toast overflows. When I pull the two halves of white bread apart, molten brie makes a speedy escape and pools on the plate, gting me with a fondue set-up for my crusts. This part Im on board with.   Theres a decent selection of festive bakes too, including a Viennese whirl take on a mince pie, and some mini swiss rolls with reindeer faces jammed onto one end. Seasonal drinks specials include the typical selection of gingerbread lattes and black forest hot chocolates - we opt for a mulled fruit warmer and a spiced apple warmer, both pound., and barely distinguishable from one another. Theyre enormous, and the mulled spice proves sickly without the body of red wine behind it. We sit and nurse our pints of hot mulled water while taking in the sweeping panorama of the pyjama aisle below us, pausing occasionally to spit out shards of star anise. All in all though, this is a perfectly pleasant supermarket Christmas experience. Not one youd choose on the big day, but itll do the job for a Wednesday lunch break.   Sainsburys Well theyve come up trumps with this years Christmas ad - people cant get enough of plug boy - but how does Sainsburys fare in the festive dinner stakes  I say dinner, thats what us Mancs call lunch, but at .pm on a Friday afternoon it was practically verging on tea time, reports Emma Gill. If there had been a mad rush for the turkey roast it had certainly died down by the time I took a seat. It doesnt seem to appear on a menu as such, thats mainly breakfast and other mains, but a sign behind the counter assures me I can get a full turkey roast dinner for a reasonable pound.. The fridge full of festive sarnies offers a wide iety for those wanting something quicker.   Judging by the empty shelf behind the Pigs in Blankets Toastie sign, , it seems thats proving a winner. Sitting down with my impressively-sized mug of tea and mince pie, well at pound. for both then why not, my meals here in  minutes. Its not so much service with a smile as service with a telling off for not having my number displayed high enough. How am I supposed to know the piece of card folds out to stand on end  Now in my younger days I wouldnt have batted an eye lid at frozen spuds and Yorkshires, but having lived with a chef for the past  years, Im not so easily pleased. They taste OK though and the meat is nice and succulent, with meaty gravy that doesnt taste like its out of a tub. Theres stuffing and cranberry sauce and to my delight, hiding cheekily between the spuds, are two mini sausages. I say delight, I was pleased by their presence, not so much their size and the absence of any piggy blanket. It makes a refreshing change to not have to fight over them mind - were a bit of a sausage-loving family in my house. The caullower cheese is a pleasant surprise too and cooked to perfection. But the only greens on my plates are sprouts.   Im not a fan of sprouts anyway but theres no way Id been eating these mushy balls. Someone didnt follow the instructions on the packet did they  Overall its a decent meal, especially for the price. With cardboard baubles hanging from the ceiling and Feed The World belting out from the speakers, its almost enough to make me feel festive. Andyoure heading to Sainsburys caff this Christmas, dont fret, theres no need to be afraid. I might have to get my pigs in blankets in a toastie next time.

Viktorija Sokolova, of Wolverhampton, was found dead by a passer-by after she was attacked in West Park near to her house on April . A post-mortem examination concluded that the -year-old, originally from Lithuania, died from a blunt force trauma to the head. Wolverhampton Crown Court has heard a -year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, murdered and anally raped Viktorija before having sex with her leless corpse. Today the court heard Viktorija had been in contact with the accused boy via Facebook before her death. But she had promised her parents she was not going to converse with stupid people while she was living in Ireland two months before her death.   The court heard she had been battered to the head, knocking out three teeth, and her clothes were soaked in blood when they were found in the park by police officers. Louise Oakley, prosecuting, said: Viktorija Sokolova was -years-old at the time of her death. At .pm on February  when she was in Ireland she send the following message to Saidas Valantinas, her step-father. She said Dad, I would like to apologise for everything I did in Wolverhampton. I promise not to converse with the stupid company and not to behave the way I behaved when I was living at yours. Please forgive me, good night. On April  she sent a message to her mother Karolina saying Im staying overnight at my friends - Im safe today. Tell coppers not to look for me as Im safe. X.  Ms Oakley said analysis of her Facebook account showed she had been in contact with the -year-old accused of her rape and murder prior to her death. Ms Oakley said: On April , a paramedic recovered items from the bench where Viktorija was found. These were a cigarette lighter, a piece of Rizla, a key to her home address, and a letter from the City of Wolverhampton Council - a medical consent form relating to a bruise being examined on her leg. Items recovered from West Park by police included a tooth from Viktorija found under a park bench, a piece of broken tooth from the floor of the pavilion and another tooth found under a bench at the back of the pavilion. Also found was a hooped earring on a bench inside the pavilion and a second hooped earring on the floor of the pavilion. A Nike baseball cap, which was white but heavily bloodstained, was found in a pool of blood on the floor of the pavilion. Also found was Viktorijas black and silver Vodafone mobile phone from the island in the boating lake.   Police seized a a pair of light pink ankle boots from the edge of the lake. A pair of white jeans - heavily bloodstained - were found inside a litter bin. Inside the jeans were a pair of black knickers. A post-mortem examination of the two teeth found and the tooth fragment concluded they were Viktorijas teeth. It was a left upper and lower canine and half an incisor. Experts concluded these had been knocked out her mouth by a violent, heavy blow or contact with a hard surface. Six other teeth were chipped. Toxicology showed a low concentration of alcohol in her blood. None was present in her urine. Alcohol can arise in the body after death. The results indicate that Viktorija would not have been intoxicated through alcohol or any [other drug] at the time she died. She had not consumed cannabis shortly before her death. Just after midnight on April , [the defendant] was arrested at home on suspicion of the murder of Viktorija. Information suggests he had contact with Viktorija just before her death. In his first interview on April  [before he was arrested], he was cautioned and provided a statement. He said I know nothing about the murder - I heard about it on the news.  Because the injured person started coming to my house at night I got annoyed so broke off with the messaging and havent seen her since. My Facebook was hacked last year. Later, he was talking very quietly and mumbling at the custody desk. On April , his home was searched. Several SMS messages and Facebook messenger calls were found but no Facebook messenger messages. These had been deleted. Records of calls made to Viktorijas phone had been deleted, as had the history of searches relating to anal sex. The court had previously heard the DNA of Mr Valantinas, Viktorijas step-father, had been found in her underwear. But yesterday, her parents angrily dismissed the defences notion they had anything to do with Viktorijas killing. Today, the court heard evidence Mr Valantinas was at home for the period when Viktorija was killed. Ms Oakley said: Saidas said that on the morning she was found, he made his way to work on a farm in the Shrewsbury, Shrops., area. His black Ford Focus was picked up by cameras on the A between Shrewsbury and Telford that morning, and after pm coming back. Detective constable Louise Dawber of West Midlands Polices homicide investigation team said cameras on Saidas road - Mostyn Street, Wolverhampton, - picked him up ing from work at .pm on April , the night before Viktorijas death. He was next seen leaving the street at .am the following morning - two hours before Viktorijas body was found in West Park. The -year-old denies charges of murder, rape and sexually penetrating her body. The trial, which is expected to last at least another week, will continue on December .

And they’re there  hours a day every single day of the year for anyone who needs them.” So, during her sell-out tour this year, Sarah asked audience members to donate to the charity through bucket collections at every show.   And, thanks to their generosity, she has raised pound, which will be shared across  Samaritans branches. Bob Howe, a Samaritans volunteer for  years thanked Sarah and her fans.

The terried woman said the man of her dreams became the man of her nightmares when their relationship turned violent, a court heard. Aron Jae Condor, of Clayton in Manchester, turned on his girlfriend, leaving her with potentially le-threatening injuries in the frenzied attack in the early hours of the morning, reports the Manchester Evening News. The muscle from her right shoulder was left exposed after he sliced through it and she told Manchester Crown Court she is now serving a mental and physical le sentence for the damage he caused her. The woman had been asleep when the -year-old began raining blows on her head and back with the blade.The pair had met in the summer of  and had an -month relationship. Things started off well, the court heard, but the defendant started suffering from increasing bouts of depression fuelled by alcohol and drugs. The relationship turned violent and Condor became paranoid. It was on February  this year, after Condor was high on drink and drugs from a three-day bender, that he carried out his brutal attack. The couple had argued over the contents of an innocuous WhatsApp message in the early hours of the morning.   Toxicology reports found that Condor had cannabis, alcohol and a metabolite of cocaine in his system, Miss Andrea Lock, prosecuting, told the court. His ex decided to go to sleep in another room after he became verbally aggressive, and made a conscious decision to stay fully clothed in case she needed to escape quickly. She had only been asleep for around  or  minutes when she awoke to find him raining blows on her back and head, Miss Lock said. The victim thought she was being punched, but then found she was heavily bleeding and saw the blows were coming from the blade of a large machete, causing catastrophic wounds, Miss Lock said. He hit her so badly that the blade had separated from the handle, she added. Condor then turned on himself and chopped at his own neck, causing a laceration. This gave his victim an opportunity to escape - she ran away from the bedroom and to the home of a neighbour, who heard her screams for help at about .am, the court was told. The injuries were potentially le threatening. They couldve had catastrophic, fatal consequences, Miss Lock said. His victim still suffers extreme physical discomfort, but she is serving a le sentence for the mental impact he had on her.   In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said: The events on the th of February will stay with me for the rest of my le. The man of my dreams became the man of my nightmares.I still struggle to get my head round why he did it. In the victim impact statement she recalled how she felt herself getting weaker following the attack but she drew strength from the fact that she needed to say goodbye to her dad, who only had days to live. I thought Im not going now, I cant not see my dad again, she said.Tragically she never got say goodbye, as he died while she was in hospital. The injuries from the attack were so bad that she struggled to do basic tasks for herself like tie her hair up or prepare food, and needed help from her mum. At the time when my mum shouldve been grieving for my dad, she was helping me cut up my food and helping me get out of bed, she said.I wasnt able to tie up my own hair or change my own sanitary towels. The court heard another victim impact statement, from November  this year, in which she said she was still traumatised and suffering from physical pain. She has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and has been prescribed antidepressants.   When officers arrived at Condors home following the attack, they also discovered he was growing  cannabis plants in two rooms, with a wholesale value of between pound, and pound,. Condor pleaded guilty to one count of section  wounding and one count of producing a controlled class B drugand abstracting electricity at an earlier hearing. The court heard that Condor was handed a community penalty in  for two charges of battery following an incident outside a chicken takeaway.Defending, Mark Fireman told the court Condor feels remorseful for what he did, although he is aware it is no consolation for his victim. He vowed to never take drink or drugs again, he told the court. Sentencing, Judge Michael Leeming said the photos of the victims injuries were simply shocking. He said: She had a cm laceration over her right shoulder. The muscle was exposed. She had a cm laceration to the back of her scalp, skull and fingers. He pointed out that the victim, who was in court to see her ex be served justice, had a tattoo next to a deep scar on her right shoulder. He said: She was proud of that tattoo. Now when she wears short-sleeved tops or bikinis, that scar will be obvious. One can readily understand how self conscious she is. Judge Leeming told the court how the victim is still unable to work and relies on her mum still for help. He sentenced Condor to a total of  years and eight months in prison on Friday. He was also handed a restraining order, meaning he is banned from seeing the victim, for an indefinite period of time.

Little Alivia had decided to use the Boxer as a canvas for her latest piece of art work and had covered the dogs white fur in multi-coloured scribbles. Speaking to MailOnline, the shocked mum from Edmonton, Kentucky, said: I quickly went to the bathroom and left my daughter playing with her art set - but when I came out I saw the mess my daughter had made. She had coloured our white Boxer in and made her a rainbow - she was pink, purple, blue, green and black.  She did lines of every colour that she had and just mixed them around to cover the dog.

So I quickly rushed Cupcake into the bathroom and ran a bath and kept on scrubbing her until the paint washed away.  Despite the bizarre situation, the mum, who works as a dog breeder and has four other Boxers, believes Cupcake enjoyed being coloured in because she was jumping around in excitement.

A person who knows the circumstances of the death and has a lawful certicate of the cause of death must first register a death with the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages. It is then necessary to obtain consent from the local authority to enable the burial to take place. A body comes within the definition of clinical waste and as such cannot be disposed of except under the provisions of the Control of Pollution Act  and the Environment Protection Act . A licensed operator is usually needed but a local authority may waive the requirement in special circumstances. Some users on the parenting forum agreed that it was a weird thing to do, but the majority said they wouldnt be bothered by it.

Lil Bill weighs a teeny-weeny .kg which is the same as a domestic cat and nearly a tenth of other cows his age. The calf was taken to The Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine, in the US, to be checked over after his owners worried he might be ill. But thankfully, Lil Bill has been given a clean bill of health - he is just a lot smaller than his other farmyard pals. Animal experts at the university shared the news of his arrival, which kicked up a huge fan base for the adorable cow. They posted a photo of Lil Bill on their Facebook page with the caption: Occasionally, we get a case that has us scratching our heads a bit. Lil Bill is one of those cases! He was born weighing a little over one-tenth of what newborn calves typically weigh.  Within hours he even had his own hashtag, #LilBill, and hundreds of comments asking after the cows welfare and generally admiring how cute he is. Some followers even asked the vets to create a separate page just for Lil Bill so they can keep up with his progress. One Facebook user wrote: Move aside micro pigs, micro cows have arrived! Another said: Lil Bill is adorable! Hope he is a healthy little man and makes it. Many raised the question of Dwarfism, one person wrote: Looking at the domed forehead, could he be a dwarf  The vets posted an update on the baby cow, writing: Thank you all for your support and interest in #LilBill - who weighed just under  pounds when he came to us! At this time, we do not plan to create a separate page for him, but we will be posting updates about him regularly, so keep checking back!  Lil Bill came to fame just days after another Knickers Australias largest cow stepped into the limelight. Knickers, an enormous black and white steer, measures a staggering ft and lives on a ranch in Western Australia. Knickers weighs ,kg and is over  times the size of Lil Bill and is so huge that they cant sell him for export.  So luckily for him, he will live out the rest of his days on his owner Geoff Pearsons farm.

Adrian Pearce and Vicki Allen met at school in Toronto in the s. Just before Christmas in  Vicki gave Adrian a small gt wrapped in shiny purple paper, however she dumped him as she handed the present over. The teen had met another boy at the mall while shopping for the gt, and decided to kiss him there and then.

Hundreds of protesters were arrested as they prepared to battle with French security forces this morning.Potential weapons, including gas cannisters, flash ball guns, baseball bats and petanque balls, were confiscated as the fourth weekend of confrontations over living costs got under way. Tourists landmarks, including the Efel Tower, have been closed while shops have been boarded up to avoid looting. Street furniture has been removed to avoid metal bars from being used as projectiles.  By am, nearly  people believed to be linked to the movement were in custody - mainly for carrying banned items, but also for violent order offences. Less than two hours later, at lunchtime, the total number of arrests was , and quickly rose to , then  at around pm local time, according to French media.By mid-afternoon, more than  people had been arrested as the confrontation intensied and protesters began hurling rocks while shouting Macron, resign in the worst rioting in Paris for decades.  Despite violent incidents on the Champs-Elysees and several attempts to block the Porte Maillot carriageway, no major incidents have been reported, police say. However, water canon and tear gas has been used in attempts to hold back protesters, who have started ripping shop boards off to form a barrier in the middle of the Champs-Elysees.Wheelie bins and boards have also been set on fire. US President Donald Trump tweeted his support for France this afternoon, saying: The Paris Agreement isn’t working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries , in order to maybe protect the environment.Chanting We Want Trump! Love France. A police source said: More than seventy have been placed under formal investigation, while a total of  have been arrested.Many were carrying a range of potential weapons, which suggested they were going to get involved in disturbances. More arrests are expected.  About , French security forces have been deployed across the country. Of these, about , are in Paris to avoid a repeat of last Saturdays mayhem when rioters torched cars and looted shops off the famed Champs Elysees bouled, and defaced the Arc de Triomphe with graffiti directed at President Emmanuel Macron. Protesters, using social media, have billed the weekend as Act IV in a dramatic challenge to Macron and his policies. The protests, named after the high-visibility safety jackets French motorists have to keep in their cars, erupted in November over the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes. Demonstrations have since swelled into a broad, sometimes-violent rebellion against Macron - a challenge made more dficult to handle since the movement has no formal leader.  Authorities say the protests have been hijacked by far-right and anarchist elements bent on violence and stirring up social unrest in a direct affront to Macron and the security forces. Nonetheless, -year-old Macron, whose popularity is at a low ebb according to polls, has been forced into making the first major U-turn of his presidency by abandoning a fuel tax. Despite the climbdown, the yellow vests continue to demand more concessions from the government, including lower taxes, higher salaries, cheaper energy costs, better retirement provisions and even Macrons resignation. One of them, Eric Drouet, a truck driver, called on protesters to storm into the Elysee presidential palace. An Elysee official has said intelligence suggested that some protesters would come to the capital to vandalise and to kill.  Macron, who has not spoken in public since he condemned last Saturdays disturbances while at the G summit in Argentina, will address the nation early next week, his office said. Yesterday evening, he visited a group of police in their barracks outside Paris, his office said. Navigating his biggest crisis since being elected  months ago, Macron has left it largely to his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, to deal in public with the turmoil and offer concessions. But he is under pressure to speak more fully as his administration tries to regain the initiative following three weeks of unrest that are the worst since the  student riots. In a sign the concessions offered by the government may be starting to weaken support for the movement, two opinion polls showed a decline in popularity for the yellow vests on Friday. The protests were supported by % of respondents in an Ifop-Fiducial poll for CNews TV, down six percentage points since a previous poll carried out on December -.

We can’t take our foot off the gas and it was disappointing.“Look, I’m sure all the boys have experienced heavy defeats before and it’s not nice but, as the manager’s been saying, it’s about how you react.“The manager’s been brilliant at saying ‘look that’s us drawn a line under it’ and all our focus has been on getting back to winning ways and trying to get some positivity about the place and smiles on the boys faces again.“If we can go and win three or four games in a row then, hopefully, that result will be forgotten about.”And Booth feels the timing of their blip is a positive because there is plenty of time left this season to recty it.Following the game in Greenock today, United face Inverness in the Highlands as they aim to close the six-point gap on Ayr.And Booth insists that is the intention, saying he does not want to go through the turmoil of play-off disappointment again after last term’s relegation with Partick.He added: “They’re hugely important, absolutely massive games, especially with the gap at six points just now, they’re vital games.“We’ve two tough away games in Morton and Inverness coming up but we’ve been playing quite well away from home this season so, hopefully, that can continue and we can keep picking up results and close the gap over the festive period.“No one would really want play-offs but we’ll see what happens. Ayr have, obviously, been flying and they’re doing really well and County are up there as well but we’ve managed to narrow the gap to kind of make it a three-horse race.“We just need to get back on the same kind of run we were on before last Friday night, we’d been playing really well and were getting all the praise.“Hopefully, coming up to Christmas and New Year, we can put another run together and I’m confident we can.”Looking ahead to the game at Cappielow today, Booth is well aware Morton will be hurting, too, and look to recover after last weekend’s - loss to Dunfermline.“It will be a tough game. Their results have been up and down this season, they have some really good results and then, like last Saturday, not so good.“They probably deserved to win the game up at Tannadice earlier in the season, I think we scored a rd-minute equaliser.“It’s going to be a hard game but one we’ve prepared for well this week and go into it confident.“We’re both going into it on the end of two shocking results last weekend so it’s going to be about who reacts best to that.“Hopefully, with the squad we’ve got and how hard we’ve been working, then we’ll be the team that comes out on top.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0a4bb3f394d.jpg ","title":"i left my drink for about 20 seconds woman tells of being spiked on dundee night out","story":"A woman has relived the horror of her drink being spiked in a Dundee students’ union after campaigners called for lids to be placed on drinks in pubs and clubs.Girls Against Spiking have launched a campaign with the backing of Police Scotland.It was revealed only a quarter of drink spiking crimes are detected, with only four recorded crimes in Scotland in .Rose Crowe, , a sales assistant from Invergowrie, had her drink spiked at DUSA The Union, calling the incident “a complete violation”.The frightening episode, which took place in December  when she was , is thought to have been the result of a prank.She said: “It is definitely the worst thing that has ever happened to me on a night out.“I went to the bar and paid for a drink then spotted some of my other friends and I went over to hug them.“I left my drink for about  seconds before I came back to get it, so it was enough time to have been spiked.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes!

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

Crucially, however, those behind the productions ndash many of whom are women ndash are keen to ensure this approach doesnrsquot come at the expense of boys, or indeed the fun, excitement and laughter that have always been the heart of Christmas shows.Gender politics was very much in the mind of director Eleanor Rhode as she worked on Wendy and Peter Pan for the Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh. The clue to her outlook is in the name of the production ndash Wendy takes centre stage.ldquoPeter Pan is the most wonderful story but traditionally Wendy has always been a bit wet, explains Ms Rhodes, who last year wowed audiences and critics alike with her production of Boudica at Shakespearersquos Globe in London. ldquoIn this show she throws off the shackles ndash Wendy is definitely the protagonist.ldquoPeter Pan has a big part to play too, obviously, but the show asks some fundamental questions about why it always has to be the girl that is the character looking after everyone, the prim and proper one, rather than the one who gets to have adventures.ldquoBut the production isnrsquot just about the fact that women are as capable as men and need to have a stronger voice. Itrsquos also about the roles we force men and boys into.Ms Rhode was inspired to work in the theatre after seeing Shakespearersquos Twelfth Night as a child, a play renowned for its strong female roles.ldquoI remember how exciting it was to see someone who looked like me on the stage, someone I could connect with, she says. ldquoA girl was at the heart of the action ndash she was the strong one, with all the best lines, leading the story. That was really important for me.As the recent furore over the first female Doctor Who ndash played by Jodie Whittaker ndash revealed, some are still critical of what they perceive as equality being forced upon society, especially when it means ldquomessing with the classics. How would the director respond to the accusation that presenting a new, more feminist Wendy betrays JM Barriersquos original ldquoFor me,you deliver the goods with an entertaining piece of theatre that has something to say, no one will go home disappointed. This is a show with a massive heart and everything people love about Peter Pan is there.More enlightened gender politics isa theme across the board. Perth Theatrersquos Snow White doesnrsquot rely on a man for her happy ending, while at the Kingrsquos Theatre in Glasgow, Widow Twankey finally gets to be a woman ndash in the shape of Elaine C Smith, no less.Scots actor Shauna Macdonald, who is directing a cast of young people in Snow White and the Seven Dwarves in Portobello, Edinburgh, was also keen to update traditional stereotypes.ldquoFor this piece wersquove ignored gender, in a good way, says the Bafta Scotland winner, star of films such The Decent and Filth, and TV dramas such as Spooks and The Cry. ldquoThe dwarves are a mix of genders and all have moustaches. It doesnrsquot matter who wears what and who ends up with whom. Therersquos a great line at one point: lsquoI identy as a princess therefore I should be treated as onersquo. We have fun with gender politics and fluidity, issues that young people are very wise to and well way ahead of their parents on. I have three daughters andI tried to read them a fairy tale with a princess being saved by her one true love, a prince, they wouldnrsquot be interested.ldquoThis a Christmas show and the purpose is to entertain, not educate. But letrsquos bend the rules and have some fun ndash who made up the rules, anyway Ms Macdonald, from Edinburgh, who also voices gadget-mad Professor Squawkencluck in CBBC cartoon Dangermouse, believes women still face institutionalised sexism in the entertainment industry.ldquoAs a female actor itrsquos a battle trying to get a good role with strong character development that challenges you as a performer, where you are not just someonersquos girlfriend, she says. ldquoCommunity theatre for young people is so important as it can have a positive impact on their choices in le.According to fellow director Rosalind Sydney, positive role models can influence even very young children. Ms Sydney is directing an all-female Christmas production at Glasgowrsquos Tron Theatre, aimed at the under-six age group.Remember December follows Flora, a forgetful little girl who has forgotten to post her letter to Santa. ldquoWhen conceiving the show it was important to reinforce the idea that girls can take the lead, be brave, physical and strong, explains the director. ldquoFlora scales a mountain, goes skiing and paddles on river rapids. The bond between grandparent and child is very important to this show, and Flora and her granny are active, physical people.ldquoBoys should have good female role models, too. I have two young sons and they are not put off by female-centred narratives or female protagonists. But gender-biased attitudes are embedded deeply into our society and when you rock the status quo people can feel a bit scared. Wersquore not taking roles models away from boys ndash wersquore just showing that it shouldnrsquot matter.Ms Sydney is keenly aware of the unique place pantos and festive shows have in our hearts ndash and the opportunities they present.ldquoChristmas shows are particularly important because for many people, especially children, itrsquos the only time of the year they come to the theatre, she says. ldquoItrsquos vital that theatre makers make the right choices.Wendy and Peter Pan is at the Lyceum in Edinburgh until anuary .

Industry insiders are reluctant to talk up low fares amid concerns that some airlines may not be able to keep Scottish routes profitable.A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: ldquoEarly December is traditionally a quiet time for aviation and therefore a great time to get a good deal on flights.ldquoCanny shoppers or those wishing to get away before a hectic Christmas are all picking up great bargains.ldquoScottish passengers have the choice of more destinations than ever and wersquore seeing increasing numbers of passengers travelling year on year.The pound collapsed the early morning of the Brexit vote and has been under pressure ever since. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March with fears rising of a no deal scenario and its devastating impact on Sterling.Last month holiday operator Thomas Cook - whose planes do a lot of the heavy lting of tourists from Scotland to sunshine destinations - announced that its profits had noseed after lower exchange rate and higher summer UK temperatures.Also last month regional airline FlyBe, amid low profits, a weak pound and Brexit uncertainty, put itself up for sale.Throwaway fares - prices so low would-be travellers book them on impulse - might sound like good news. And any airline will discount to put bums on seats. However, travel experts stress that the cost of a holiday - in sterling terms - is still high. You might get to Fuerteventura this month for the cost of apeak train fare from Glasgow to Edinburgh.

Fares have since edged up to around pound each.Next weekend flights to the sunny Canarian island of Lanzarote are down to pound , leaving on Friday and ing on Monday.Industry insiders stressed that the airline recently cut the size of its free hand luggage and was therefore in a position to offer lower fares. Its change, which came in to place on November , has angered some consumer groups.

Once a certain fare band has been booked up, the next one will be displayed, and this will likely be at a higher price, as you might expect with a supply-demand model.ldquoAs an example, The Herald found a Prestwick to Tenere flight for pound ndash the price is now pound, most probably as the lower fare band has been booked up.ldquoAirlines want to ensure they maximise loads and encourage travel, so travellers may additionally see lower prices and sales for travel during January: this tends to be a slightly quieter month when compared to peak holiday times such as Easter.The flip-side of the falling pound is that more people from overseas are travelling to holiday in Scotland.

What better things did others have to do given the depth of the crisis that the UK Government is now engulfed in As for the Prime Minister, she was ensconced in her Berkshire bunker, no doubt contemplating the twists and turns that the next few days might bring and whether she will still be in Downing St by the end of it.Mrs May could also be forgiven for watching Saturday nightrsquos Sunday papers review from behind her Maidenhead sofa as they are likely to be full of screaming headlines about insurmountable parliamentary numbers, threats of ministerial resignations and impending confidence votes in her and her government.Of course, given the off-on and then off-again saga of the televised debate, the PM can now at least spend Sunday evening watching Strictly while her Labour counterpart sits glued to the final of Irsquom a Celebrity.But it will be an all-too-brief respite from Brexit and its political ramications in the coming days.Tory Remainer Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, warned her party thatit continued to be consumed by Brexit, then it would lose the support of Middle England to another party that occupied the centre and centre-right ground. And she said thatthe Tories did not change, they would never have another landslide election victory.ldquoThe Conservative party has failed to really change, declared Ms Greening. ldquoItrsquos almost like weve got this Old Testament of how Margaret Thatcher did politics and, of course, then it was absolutely current and relevant for Britain but not enough people in our party are looking at who are we now whats Conservatism in the st century stand for now, the London MP told the BBCrsquos Nick Robinson in his Political Thinking podcast.Oh and she also said she would be prepared to consider throwing her hat in the ringMrs May left her leadership role willingly or otherwise next week.On Monday, after a weekend of what s, MPsto Westminster to debate the Brexit Bill and the Union.There will be lots of talk about Northern Ireland and the impenetrable backstop to the backstop issue as well as about Scotland and the possible knock-on effect of a second independence referendum. I can hear Brenda from Bonnyrigg now.In the past few days there has been serious talk of Mrs May pulling the vote. Advice that came not only from some of her ministers but also from Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the  backbench committee. Indeed, Tony Blair waded in to echo the advice, noting there was no point in crashing into a ldquobrick wall at speed.What has apparently irked the PMrsquos closest colleagues is that when she stonewalls in public about a Plan B, she does the same to them in private.Now it could well be in this unpredictable dimension we call Brexit that Mrs May pulls off an outstanding parliamentary escape on Tuesday that would outshine even Harry Houdini. But I very much doubt it.So what happens when MPs pull the plug on the PMrsquos Brexit Plan  There is a suggestion that those kind souls in Brussels will offer a helping hand and say the EU is willing to extend Article  for a couple of months to allow the UK more time to pull itself together. Yet the deal agreed last month is legally binding and unchangeable. So it is unlikely there will be any sympathy on the continent.Mrs May has been looking at other options, flying a parliamentary kite about giving MPs a say nearer the time in spring  when the UK and EU will have to determine whether or not a trade agreement can be agreed by the December of that year. Probably not.So MPs could at that point choose to see the dreaded backstop introduced from January  or vote to extend the transition, which would maintain the status quo for however many more months including compliance with the loathed Common Fisheries Policy. Which, of course, would send Scottish Conservatives into a blue funk, not least David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary.If the PM goes ldquodown in a blaze of glory, as one colleague suggested she was determined to do, what happens Her suggestion of a ldquoparliamentary lock has all been about damage limitation trying to peel away as many Tory rebels as she can to keep the numbers manageable. Anything below  is just about manageable anything above it becomes trickier. Anything above  and the smell of toast will be in the air at Westminster.Labourrsquos Sir Keir Starmer has already suggested that it is ldquoinevitable that Labour would next Wednesday put down a confidence vote in the Conservative Government. But the Democratic Unionists have already indicated they would support the Tories in that scenario.So the prospect of another general election would then evaporate.But Mrs May will not be out of the woods yet. If the Tory rebellion on the meaningful vote on the PMrsquos Brexit Plan is more than , then the prospect of another confidence vote, a Conservative one in Mrs Mayrsquos leadership, looms large.If this were to happen, then, once again, it would be about the scale of the rebellion.Already, there are suggestions of backbenchers are being nodded and winked at about future government rolesthey backed a certain senior colleague should Mrs May be history by next Friday.The names being bandied around the oak-led corridors include Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd all, of course, Remainers. Then there is Boris, waiting in the wings, and still waiting for the rugby ball to come out of the scrum.It should be remembered that the ultimate choice in any leadership contest goes to the Conservative Party membership and the grassroots appear far more pro-Leave than some of their MPs at Westminster.As the Brexit deal vote approaches on Tuesday, it is well to note that we are living in extraordinary political times. The countryrsquos future is up in the air as, indeed, is Mrs Mayrsquos and the Conservative Governmentrsquos.The moment of truth comes on Tuesday evening but, given the nature of this particular political beast, therersquoll be another one along soon after.

Around  people have recorded trees since the project began and Scotland presently has five veriers.The UKrsquos ancient trees have no automatic right of protection. There is no equivalent to Scheduled Ancient Monument status, which important archaeological sites have.The Woodland Trust says that ldquothe famous Fortingall Yew highlights the disparity.Found growing in the churchyard of the Perthshire village which shares its name, it is among the oldest trees in Europe ndash modern experts estimate the tree is between , and , years old, although others believe it could be a remnant of a post-Roman Christian site dating back , years.According to folklore, Pontius Pilate ndash the Roman governor who oversaw the crucixion of Jesus ndash was born in its shade and played there as a child.But the Trust points out that it is the wall around the tree that attracts formal legal protection, rather than the tree itself.ldquoAncient trees are as much a part of our heritage as stately homes, cathedrals and works of art, but they donrsquot get the same protection, Ms Harrison Mellor adds.Vital statistics of the Murthly Castle tree were taken on Thursday afternoon by Judy Dowling from St Andrews, Joan Sneddon from Largo, Noel Fojut from Berwickshire, Clair McFarlan from Dumfries and Lorna Holl from Balmaha.It was recorded with a remarkable trunk girth of . metres. The tree itself is estimated to be more than  years old.

It takes you to some amazing places. I have just loved being a part of this.Welcoming the tree hunters to Castle Murthly Estate, Thomas Steuart Fothringham said: ldquoWe are delighted our sweet chestnut is the ,th tree to go on the inventory.ldquoThe designed landscape has been a feature at Murthly for half a millennium and continues to be highly valued.There are  trees which are so iconic they have their own inidual names such as Capon Oak, Mar Lodge Granny Pine, Drumlanrig Sycamore, Rizziorsquos Chestnut and Glen Lyon Ash.In October, a spruce tree on the Isle of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides was named Scotlandrsquos Tree of the Year.Nettyrsquos Tree was nominated in the Woodland Trust competition by Eoina Wilson, who lives in Inverness but originally comes from the island. Judges chose six trees from public nominations which were then put to an online vote.The spruce was, until recent times, the only tree on the windswept island.It was planted more than  years ago by the poet, priest and land rights activist Father Allan McDonald, whose best-known poem was Eilein na hrsquoOige ndash The Island of the Young.It is named after Netty MacDonald, who lived on the nearby croft and encouraged all the islandrsquos children to play on the tree as their cries and laughter reminded her of her own family who had grown up and moved away to find work on the mainland.A map of all the recorded trees can be viewed at ati.woodlandtrust.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"how-secrets-of-12th-century-scots-castle-were-lost-in-the-mists-of-time","story":"The exploration of Mote of Urr in Dumfries and Galloway spanned three years and dug into  years of Scottish history. Perhaps given such a vast timescale, there was no urgent need to share the findings.Indeed, itrsquos only now,  years after the meticulous excavation took place and possibly hindered by the lead archaeologistrsquos well-known sluggish approach to putting his research into print, that the fine details of excavations have finally been published.The dig at the th-century Norman motte and bailey castle site at Mote of Urr, near Dalbeattie ndash said to be one of the most extensive sites of its kind in Scotland ndash were undertaken in  and , and led by Brian Hope-Taylor, one of the UKrsquos most revered archaeologists and a familiar face on s television history programmes.The intention was to uncover relics that could point to the daily le of the wooden castle and the identities of the occupants of the two-hectare site over hundreds of years which, despite its scale and prominence on the landscape, were largely lost in time.Buthistorians and locals were eagerly awaiting news of the secrets lurking at the curious bulging mound remains at Mote of Urr, they would be sadly disappointed.And it would take the exhaustive piecing together of Hope-Taylorrsquos notes and  years after his death before the work could finally be shared.ldquoBrian Hope-Taylor was a charismatic and perspicacious scholar, says Professor Barbara Crawford of the University of St Andrews and University of the Highlands and Islands, in the newly published report. ldquoLike some other archaeologists Hope-Taylor did not find it easy to write up the results of his excavations for final publication.Famed for his work on Anglo-Saxon and early medieval sites in Scotland and England, he undertook excavations at Bamburgh, Lindisfarne and York Minster, one of his key interests was in motte-and-bailey castles, wooden structures built on top of a raised earthwork such as at Mote of Urr.But archaeology fees paid little ndash perhaps a reason for his sluggish approach to report writing ndash and Hope-Taylor, who had also received a ldquosevere dressing down from superiors over delays in reporting findings from a major excavation of an Anglo Saxon site at Yeavering in Northumberland, is thought to have shelved certain projects either because they failed to produce obvious results or because he sought others which may have been more lucrative.His death in  led to scores of papers relating to several archaeological excavations being retrieved from his house and garage, with many relating to Scottish excavations being delivered to the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland ndash now Historic Environment Scotland.Funding from Historic Scotlandand English Heritage, meant they could be finally assessed, sorted, conserved and, at last in the case of Mote of Urr, published. The work, which has been supplemented by an exhaustive historical investigation by Professor Richard Oram of Stirling University, sheds fresh light on the ownership of the site down the centuries even though it reveals Hope-Taylor found a surprising lack of material to support existing understanding of its origins.For although records point to the castle being under the possession of Walter de Berkeley, the th-century Great Chamberlain of William , Hope-Taylorrsquos team of archaeologists could not find any pottery linked to that era.ldquoHope-Taylor dated the construction and earliest occupation at Mote of Urr to the late th century, with continued occupation into the th century, says David Perry of Alder Archaeology, who worked on the report.Catherine Smith, who worked on analysing bone fragments found by Hope-Taylorrsquos team, said he may have deliberately delayed writing his report of the excavation with the intention of ing in the future.She said: ldquoHope-Taylor was a very eminent archaeologist and itrsquos possible that he was saying to himself that hersquod just finish one project and go back to Mote of Urr, but never did.ldquoWe donrsquot know why he didnrsquot finish it. Itrsquos possible that he didnrsquot discover enough about it at the time and he knew it would require more work.While Hope-Taylorrsquos records of the excavation are said to be ldquoan important contribution to the study of mottes in Scotland, Mr Perry said they raise more questions than answers.ldquoFollowing his investigations of the motte in  and  Hope-Taylor had originally planned toto Mote of Urr in order to excavate its surrounding bailey.

It has been a gradual build-up over the years but I think the way the Highland Council has been dealing with issues has not helped and it has not helped any of you whatsoever.Mrs Manson promised a ldquolistening council when she took the reins from Steve Barron last month. That has included a y series of drop-ins across the sprawling Highland Council area inviting people to share what they feel the local authority does well and where therersquos room for improvement.The council faces a massive budget gap against a backdrop of simmering public discontent over areduction in services as belts are tightened.She said she was willing to look at all issues raised. She said: ldquoI need to think about how we structure staff in the council so that people feel there is an equal service out there.The planned introduction of parking charges to a town which boasts freely available space prompted warnings. Councillor Margaret Paterson said: ldquoI can tell you that the majority of people in Dingwall want you to stop imposing parking charges. And as a council you donrsquot care how the High Street will go down the plug hole because of it.Mrs Manson said she would consider the concerns raised during the drop-ins and would report back in January.What do YOU think  We welcome feedback.

In the past, people in such a situation would have been struggling to make ends meet on benefits. But the survey, by the Citizens Advice Scotland, found that  per cent of people who had a job had either skipped meals or reduced the amount of food they eat because of a lack of funds.Derek Mitchell, the group’s chief executive, said: “For some people going hungry is the norm ... this study shows that many working people in Scotland are struggling to afford to buy food and in , this is simply unacceptable.”: % of Scots worry that the food cupboard may become barePeople do have a tendency to underestimate how much they eat, forgetting about snacks during the day, so polls on this subject may not be entirely accurate. The most recent Scottish Health Survey found  per cent of people in the poorest areas had gone hungry because of a lack of money.However,the picture is anything like as widespread as either survey suggests it should act as yet another a call to arms to add to others this year.In July, Holyrood’s Education Committee published a report saying they were “appalled by some of the evidence it heard, including the amount of evidence received about children in Scotland going to school hungry”. And only yesterday Action for Children said that every day its staff “see first-hand the impossible choice that families living in practically Dickensian levels of poverty have to make”.: MSPs shocked by poor and hungry Scottish pupilsSuch problems cry out for Scotland’s politicians to do something. But, as The Scotsman said yesterday, suggestions that the answer is to raise taxes should be treated with caution because of the risk of damaging the economy and making poverty even worse.However, politicians have other weapons in their armoury. For example, companies that use illegal or unethical working practices or find ways to avoid paying the minimum wage should face a further clampdown. A fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work is an idea that politicians of all parties should support.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4840499.1544122439!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotrail scores another spectacular own goal alastair dalton","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland#s Railways: The Story That Keeps On Giving was the title of a presentation I gave to a rail group this summer.Of all the types of transport I cover, it provides easily the most plentul source of news – good and bad. That’s perhaps because the rail network occupies a separate environment,not, with its many quirks, a parallel universe.I explained to the audience, who included ScotRail Alliance managing director Alex Hynes, that while there will always be negative stories about the railways, there have been some spectacular own goals by the industry in generating its own bad publicity.The examples I gave included current ScotRail operator Abellio instructing its staff in  to cut its predecessor’s logos from their unorms because new ones weren’t ready.I also highlighted the row over previous operator First shrinking its coffee cups because it could not meet the demand for hot drinks. The then managing director was livid to hear this had happened without his knowledge.I’m sorry to say ScotRail has done it again.You’d think that just after announcing a fares increase, amid dozens of daily cancellations because of staff shortages and industrial action, and while suffering the worst punctuality for years, would not be the best time to create more bad news.: Alastair Dalton: The vested interest blocking cuts to air pollutionBut no, the train operator confirmed on Monday it was scrapping its Kids Go Free promotion for five to -year-olds travelling with an adult. It will be replaced from next month by Kids for a Quid, a flat-fare £instead.ScotRail said the number of eligible children would increase from two to four per adult. It will also be extended to season ticket and flexipass holders, some of whom had apparently complained about having to buy another ticket so their children could travel free.Opposition parties and unions had a field day – Labour launched a petition while the Transport and Salaried Staffs’ Association accused ScotRail of “totally Scrooge-like behaviour”.Apart from the ill-judged timing, loss-making ScotRail’s decision appears to something of a gamble financially.It may prompt season ticket holders to take their kids by train, but introducing a charge – even £ – could equally dissuade others from going by rail. That could be particularly so on shorter trips around Glasgow, where most ScotRail journeys are made, and where even adult fares cost only a few pounds.: ‘Best railway Scotland’s ever had’ delayed by wrong type of threadHowever, the biggest issue with the change is that it flies in the face of Scottish Government policy of getting people out of their cars.Transport secretary Michael Matheson regards taking the train as “active travel”, along with walking and cycling, because it also involves at least one of those.Signicantly, he did not defend ScotRail when questioned about the change by MSPs on Tuesday – and said he understood people’s concerns.Children should become familiar with public transport as potential future users. I know of primary school teachers surprised to find few of their pupils have travelled by train, even at a school close to a busy Glasgow station. Some at a recent ten-year-old’s birthday party had never been on a bus.A decade ago, First ScotRail became the first UK train operator to offer free accompanied child travel daily.

Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh #  she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1295009.jpg--.jpg?1544181922000\n","title":"new york concert date for kells flautist","story":"A Kells teenager has been selected to join the prestigious National Youth Orchestra.Jake Houston has been playing the flute for eight years and is set to take his place in the world’s greatest orchestra of teenagers in December.The -year-old will join  other teenagers from all over the country as part of the Youth Orchestra, which is also planning its first ever tour to the USA in .The members of the orchestra were selected following  days of auditions held in  cities across the country.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"suzanne breen unionists united in opposition as remainers rally around backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"huge boost for city centre as primark gets ready to open its doors again","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Williamson quit in protest at the Prime Minister’s deal.Colchester MP Will Quince hit out at the backstop plan to avoid a hard border with Ireland, saying it could result in the UK being “tied to the negotiating table for years, until we agree to anything in desperation” to get out of the situation.Writing in the Sunday , Mr Quince said: “I do not want to be explaining to my constituents why Brexit is still not over and we are still obeying EU rules in the early s or beyond.“Unless and until this is amended, the Withdrawal Agreement cannot receive my support.” PA\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Tory MP Will Quince has quit as a ministerial aide over Theresa May’s Brexit plan  PAThe Prime Minister faces widespread opposition to her plan across the Commons, including both

Government is defeated.“If it doesn’t get through, anything could happen – People’s Vote, Norway-plus, any of these options could come forward and none of them are as good as the current arrangement we have got with the Withdrawal Agreement to vote on on Tuesday.”Her comments could be viewed as an attempt to win over Brexiteers who might prefer Mrs May’s deal, even with its controversial Northern Irish backstop, to a Norway-plus future inside both the single market and customs union or the possibility of another referendum reversing the  vote.“A lot of people have a perfect vision of what they think Brexit should look like, and that ‘perfect’ is not available,” she told BBC Radio ’s Today.“What we need is a compromise deal, that’s what the Prime Minister has proposed and I would urge my colleagues to think about, first of all, why people voted to leave the European Union, what their interpretation is of that and secondly, what the alternatives are.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber

for people not just to think why they don’t particularly like the Withdrawal Agreement but what they would like better that is available and would get through the House of Commons.”Mrs May was warned by critics that she could be forced to stand down as Prime Ministerher Brexit deal is defeated in the Commons next week.Eurosceptic former party leader Iain Duncan Smith cautioned against the PM and her Cabinet deciding to “brazen it out”, saying such an approach would be a “disaster”.He told the Daily : “I believe thatthe response is, ‘we’ve lost but we will do this all over again’, it will

the aftermath of a defeat.“What would be a complete mistake would be to allow what is already an unstable period to descend into further instability with talk of a leadership change,” she said.The Cabinet minister also appeared to endorse an amendment to the Government’s motion for the vote on Tuesday tabled by former Northern Ireland minister Sir Hugo Swire in an attempt to win over wavering Eurosceptics.The alteration would mean Parliament would have to approve a decision to trigger the backstop arrangement, put a one-year time limit on it and seek assurances from the EU that the backstop would be temporary.Ms Rudd told Today: “Hugo Swire has put an amendment down which I hope will give some of my colleagues reassurance over the so-called backstop.”Former Conservative leader Michael Howard, who opposes Theresa Mays deal, says the UK should plan more for Brexit without a full withdrawal agreement.

Our role is to come together to find a joint approach that supports the decision of the referendum and promotes the national interest.— David DavisDecember , “Our role is to come together to find a joint approach that supports the decision of the referendum and promotes the national interest,” he said.Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would consider delaying Britain’s exit from the EU to negotiate a better dealhis party came to power.“If we go into government straight away we would start negotiating straight away. If it meant holding things a bit longer to do it, of course,” he told Sky News.Mr Corbyn said his party was ready to “step in and negotiate” with the EU and would form a minority government “ that is what is on offer”.Ahead of the Commons showdown, controversial activist Tommy Robinson will lead a pro-Brexit march in London on Sunday – with a rival counter-demonstration set to oppose it.Elsewhere in the capital, the pro-EU Best for Britain and second referendum campaign the People’s Vote will hold a rally featuring politicians including Lord Heseltine and celebrities such as actors Charles Dance and Jason Isaacs."},{"url":null,"title":"safety paramount road closures remain as west belfast bomb search continues","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"travis frontman lends voice to music hall reopening","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To work so hard to organise this event and support fellow kidney patients is magnicent.ldquoAll their hard work and attention to detail certainly paid off and it was wonderful to be with them on the day to help out and see this couples infectious enthusiasm in action.ldquoOn behalf of Kidney Care UK I thank them for their hard work and efforts to rally so many people to support a cause which touches the lives of so many.Thanking Stephen and Christine on behalf of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, William Johnston said: ldquoIt was lovely to get the chance to join with Stephen and Christine in the beautul setting of Castle Ward and to see their enthusiasm for supporting our cause and delivering and Organ Donation message of hope.ldquoI want to say a special word of thanks to them for really pulling out the stops to put together an amazing event to help local kidney patients and their families..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaign to clamp down on dog fouling  ","story":"LOCAL council officials have unveiled a new campaign aimed at helping rid the district of its dog fouling problem.It is a particularly contentious issue and one of the single most complained about problems in the area and, despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed and there is virtually no town or village not affected by it.This week, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has launched a new awareness campaign to remind dog owners about the importance of cleaning up after their dogs.Rolled out after a survey by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul found that levels of dog fouling had increased from the previous year, the local authority is determined to get a grip on the issue.One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.While the mindset of these particular iniduals is hard to fathom and it is concerning that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind, council officials hope the new campaign can change minds.Dog owners are being reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so is leaving them open to an pound fine.In addition, dog owners are reminded that they are responsible for training their dogs properly to lsquodo their businessrsquo in their ownerrsquos garden where it can then be collected and placed in a black bin.Politicians have become increasingly frustrated at the blatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and council officials are prepared to do all they can to tackle the problem. Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery. However, thanks to the initial care of the HEMS team, the work of the Belfast Trust and follow-up surgery, Damienrsquos arm has been saved.ldquoIt has been a long journey to recovery so far, but I have been making great progress and exceeding the expectations of my medical team, Damien confirmed.ldquoEvery week there is further improvement and we are now hopeful that I will gain % mobility in my arm. I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event. We were thrilled to be able to present this to the charity.Shirley Gilliland, who owns the Carryduff firm along with her husband John added: ldquoDamien has been part of the company for over four years and as a close team we were all gutted when the accident happened.ldquoThe speed of the response of the air ambulance and the critical interventions at the scene have clearly made a dference in Damienrsquos recovery. Wersquore so grateful to have him back on the team and doing well.ldquoWhilst you take every precaution accidents can happen and we are now very much aware of the role that the air ambulance has to play in the local community, including the impact for industry related accidents.ldquoI would urge other companies to do what they can to support the service whether that is by corporate donation or fundraising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great grandmother’s pens new children’s novel  ","story":"A CLOUGH woman has just published her third childrenrsquos book in a series cleverly written to capture the imagination of young readers.Eighty six year-old Maureen Donnellyrsquoa book, Five Famous Dogs of Ireland, which is illustrated by Ulster artist Susan Hughes, looks at the wealth of legends and rich folklore which has almost been forgotten today.Mrs Donnelly, whose late husband, the Rev James Donnelly, was rector of Saul and Inch Parish Churches, says she got her inspiration from a picture of her great grandson, one year-old Rory Donnelly, holding on to a fluffy teddy bear in one hand and patting the familyrsquos pet dog with the other.She said: ldquoIt struck me when I saw the photo how well children and animals get along.

His wolfhound was called Bawn and was known to be the best jumping dog in all of Ireland and could scare off the meanest of enemies.Mrs Donnelly said: ldquoI had the privilege to grow up with stories such as Bran. I loved the story so much I wrote it down back then. And Irsquom really glad I did. I came to write all the ones I could recall back then too. These tales will be sure to ignite again the imaginations of every child who reads them.No book would be complete without the tale of Setanta, the young boy who grew up to be a brave warrior. He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation. So much of our heritage and culture is being lost on our young generation.ldquoThis series of books is a way for me to rescue those stories.

He doesnrsquot hog the limelight ndash in fact quite the opposite. He stays away from it. His hero status is earned, though, his earning of the status is not a deliberate focus. That is more for others to do. If we donrsquot have heroes then where do we get our inspirations from  Often our heroes are close to home, and that is true of this one.Itrsquos early summer  and an eager  year-old is anxious to know. ldquoWell, was he there  The equally eager  year-old, deciding to be a wee bit cute, replied: ldquoWho  A few playful expletives from the  year-old and the  year-old burst out laughing: ldquoAye, he was there ndash there was no county training tonight.:It was the first Town senior training session the  year-old attended. Dferent times. A  year-old nowadays would be a ball-boy at training. ldquoDid he train or was he ndash like ndash just there standing about not involved as he was on the county team A few expletives from medeclared: ldquoOf course he trained ndash hersquos Arkle the county captain, midfielder for The Town. ldquoDid he pass the ball to you and by the way hersquos a Fontenoy , the nineteen year-old declared robustly.ldquoYes he did I replied excitedly. The Town man gave me great encouragement and told me to keep coming back to training. He is our hero. Hersquos everyonersquos hero. I will come back to our nineteen-year old later.Over  Gaels from Down, all over Ireland and beyond gathered in the Slieve Donard Hotel last Friday night to honour and to pay tribute to one of Downrsquos greatest ever footballers, none other than the great Colm McAlarney.His evening started with a knock on the door at his home in the Town when club chairman, Kevin Sweeney, and event organiser Kevan Owens surprised Colm in his kitchen with those immortal words ldquotonight Colm ndash this is your le.It was filmed and the first sign of his hero status became apparent ndash total shock and his humble disbelief. Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one. If they do not have a decoration, we can make one for them.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those. Over the past two years, ours was one of the community festivals that had been unsuccessful in securing council funding.Mr Casey added: ldquoAs we approach our th anniversary, it would be a boostwe knew we had funding in good time, allowing our festival to be included in tourism brochures next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17218586.daffodils-group-the-perfect-way-to-kick-start-the-week/resources/images/9130741.jpg","title":"dont snooze on these great black friday mattress deals","story":"While having a consistent bedtime routine, avoiding screens in the run up to settling down for the night and creating a clam and relaxing atmosphere are all important to getting quality shut eye, mattresses*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

MPs have the weight of that responsibility on their shoulders, and no MP takes that responsibility lightly.In extraordinarily dficult circumstances, where just over half the country voted Leave, I think the Prime Minister has shown her determination to respect the outcome of the EU referendum, while simultaneously protecting jobs, minimising the damage to our economy and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. As a committed unionist, Theresa May has also ensured that both the constitutional guarantee for Northern Ireland and the consent principle of the Belfast Agreement are reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration, and they will be again when a final deal is struck on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.So, Northern Ireland’s constitutional status within the United Kingdom continues to be in our own hands. And as unionists we will determine our future with confidence, not with fear. As for the so-called “backstop”, it would apply , and only , at the end of the transition period on st December , the UK and the EU have failed to agree their future trading relationship. However, the British Government and the EU have been very clear they do not want to see any backstop coming into operation.As the Attorney General has explained, the backstop,we were ever to be in it, would be ‘as much an instrument of pain to the European Union as it would be to the United Kingdom.’ So, there are major incentives for both sides to negotiate a good future trading relationship for the entire UK, thereby avoiding the need for the backstop. I have been particularly struck by the number of businesses in Northern Ireland, farmers, community leaders and fishermen who have said they believe Theresa May’s Brexit deal is a good one for Northern Ireland. Can they all be wrong  Of course, not. I believe they have got it absolutely right. And in supporting the Prime Minister’s deal, they are taking a pragmatic approach, not a political one. If MPs vote down the deal next Tuesday, we risk crashing out of the EU on th March  and that would be a disaster for jobs and for our economy. It could also impact on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland within the UK, because a no-deal Brexit would mean a hard border on the island of Ireland.Sinn Fein would inevitably exploit a hard border for political gain with increased demands for a border poll every time we have an election. I have no intention whatsoever of gting Sinn Fein that opportunity. Last, but not least, it is worth looking at the tactics of the Labour Party. Labour repeatedly says it will not support May’s deal. They want to sink Theresa May, her deal and the government in order to precipitate a General Election where they expect to see Jeremy Corbyn ed as Prime Minister.Having Corbyn as Prime Minister would be an unmitigated disaster for Britain, for Northern Ireland and, more particularly, for unionism and I am not prepared to take that risk, evenothers are. Although the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal is not perfect, I will vote to support her efforts to achieve the best deal for the whole of the United Kingdom, one which protects jobs in Northern Ireland and also protects Northern Ireland’s constitutional status and the consent principle as guaranteed by the Belfast Agreement.We Christians are vanishing from the Middle East – what will become of it without us  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"•Lady Sylvia Hermon has been MPfor North Down since JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8733402.1544296166!/image/image.jpg","title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics       Bill after MPs supported a Tory rebel amendment for a meaningful vote.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre. The family-owned firm is taking on an empty unit at the front of Queen’s Arcade at Donegall Place. It already has its flagship store at the arcade. It comes as the company has unveiled a new Rolex workshop at its Belfast base, which means it can carry out servicing of the watches in-house. Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town.

The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.
