You were putting an appeal in to get her prosecuted, you never bothered to see her.\u0027If it had been... an ordinary person, you wouldn\u0027t have prosecuted.\u0027I see domestic abuse and I just think you should be disgusted with yourself so there is nothing we can do to bring Caroline back. I hope in hindsight you do regret this. This girl killed herself because you put an appeal through.\u0027Earlier in the hearing DI Batemen had insisted she had not treated the presenter any differently because she was famous and would not change her decisions.She said a caution was not appropriate because Flack did not admit her guilt in a police interview, although she had said \u0027I hit him, he was cheating on me\u0027 at the scene.Mr Daw, the author of Justice on Trial, said she should have been given the chance to agree to the lesser police action.He said: \u0027What should have happened here is that she should have been offered a caution, in the cold light of day I strongly expect from experience, had she been offered one her lawyers would have advised her to accept it and in all probability she would have done.\u0027The CPS came to the view that a caution was appropriate, yet the police were adamant for reasons I don\u0027t understand that there had to be a criminal prosecution.\u0027It seems to me that the system failed on a number of levels. It failed because there appears to have been undue influence by two factors, her high profile and therefore there\u0027s a desire not be seen to be going soft on someone who is in the public eye and risking adverse public comment – that was a factor undoubtedly in this case.\u0027This is not a case where there was evidence where the victim was under coercion or so vulnerable he was incapable of making a decision on what was best for him – and there are such cases, where the victim wants to withdraw the complaint through fear.\u0027We have had victims of domestic violence committing suicide because they are forced into the court system.\u0027Here we have a decision in principle by the CPS prosecution was not in the public interest and having made that decision they are persuaded to change that assessment by the police even though it\u0027s nothing to do with the police. The police have no role in the public interest, it\u0027s not their job, their job is to investigate and present the file to the CPS – it is not to decide what is in the public interest.\u0027My major concern here is that the CPS\u0027s decision, which is so fundamental in the system about public interest, was overridden by the police – that shouldn\u0027t happen. I don\u0027t accept that is a legitimate exchange of views between the CPS and the police.\u0027  A CPS spokesperson said it stood by its decision and said Flack\u0027s fame had no bearing on it.They added: \u0027A suspect\u0027s celebrity status is not a factor in our decisions to prosecute.\u0027Our handling of this case was carefully reviewed throughout and our guidance and legal tests were followed.We are satisfied that the prosecution was correctly brought. \u0027The issue of Miss Flack\u0027s mental health was addressed on a number of occasions throughout the legal process. Our decisions were made on the basis of the medical opinion available to us each time.\u0027As the inquest heard there was clearly a more significant history of issues and a further deterioration of Miss Flack\u0027s mental health of which we had not been made aware.\u0027 Justice on Trial: Radical Solutions for a System at Breaking Point: Chris Daw: Bloomsbury Continuum"},{"url":null,"title":"North London landlord rents garden shed 1 500 month","story":"Share this article The little home is in a large \u0027well kept\u0027 garden with an outdoor deck and private entrance, just a short bus ride away from Highgate Station.There is underfloor heating, a small, fully-equipped kitchen and a \u0027stylish new shower room\u0027 with wood effect tiles.The landlord describes one of the bedrooms as a \u0027charming and magical mezzanine sleeping area\u0027.\u0027Wake up to the smell of pine and the birds singing,\u0027 the advert says.Only one other room with a single bed is pictured. The rent includes all bills, wifi and free parking. Smoking and pets are not allowed, but the landlord will consider short term lets.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands bikers descend South Dakota town 10 day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally","story":"Share this article400,000 bikers usually descend on this South Dakota town for their annual rally.

How is he giving advice to us?\u0027 she asked.In Paris, Macron\u0027s domestic political opponents from the far left to the far right warned the centrist leader against creeping neocolonialism, and extracting political concessions from Lebanon in exchange for aid. \u0027Solidarity with Lebanon should be unconditional,\u0027 tweeted Julien Bayou, head of the popular Greens party.Macron himself firmly rejected the idea of reviving the French mandate.\u0027You can\u0027t ask me to substitute for your leaders.

I needed somewhere to live and I ended up taking the keys to a two-bedroom upstairs Tyneside flat in Scotswood for the “huge sum” of £29 a week. It was film or rent, and I chose film.Even in its heyday, the West End of Newcastle, and Scotswood especially, had always had a certain reputation for its poverty and deprivation, most notoriously as the home to the child killer Mary Bell back in the 1960s. But by the mid- to late-1980s it had been hit extremely hard by the waves of deindustrialisation that had closed down most of Armstrong’s munitions works, the area’s biggest employer, that ran all the way from Elswick to Scotswood along Scotswood Road, heading west out of Newcastle.In September 1991, the West End of Newcastle was hit by riots that spread across Tyneside after two joy-riders died in a police chase on the Coast Road at Wallsend to the east of Newcastle. By comparison to events such as Handsworth or the Broadwater Farm riots, the rioting was pretty subdued, but it still resulted in the burning out of the post office on Armstrong Road where I’d photographed women queuing to cash their child benefit cheques four years earlier.Despite being largely forgotten, these riots caused ructions among policymakers and politicians because of their nihilism – lacking the ready-causes such as the institutionalised racism Leslie Scarman addressed in the wake of the Brixton and Toxteth riots in the early 1980s. The causes of these riots were structural to the Thatcherite project that no fact-finding visits by Michael Heseltine were going to address adequately. We are still living with the consequences three decades later.Most of the pictures in this series were shot incidentally as I’d go for a walk, go get the bus, or just live my life rather than as a specific project. It has resulted in a broad survey of the historical, political and economic changes that my home region has undergone and these photographs are simply one strand of a much wider, more polemical essay charting my own responses to those changes.Living there for nine years was often surreal, as “twocked” and burnt cars became so common that it took something interesting such as a Mini stuffed down the steps of the Old Scotswood station to register as a bit unusual.I moved from Scotswood in 1996, having lived there for 9 years. The area was in seemingly terminal decline as the anti-social behaviour grew, and my old street was finally flattened in the early 2000s, despite the tens of millions of pounds that had been pumped into the area in the wake of the rioting.Jeremy Deller, an artist, wanted to be photographed in a Coronation Street setting. Although Robert Street in Scotswood, where I was living at the time, was not exactly like Salford, all we had to do was go out of my front door for a suitably “northern” location, where we proceeded to photograph each other. Technicolor was still several years off – and the north of England really felt black and white in those days.The lower part of Scotswood and Benwell, above Scotswood Road, is currently being redeveloped as part of a large publicprivate initiative to build housing and attract people back to the area. If it can rid itself of the stigma of poverty and deprivation that blighted the area for many years, it does have a lot going for it, such as wonderful views across the Tyne valley and great transport links – being close to the A1, which runs northsouth, and the A69, which runs eastwest.• Mark Pinder is a documentary and editorial photographer living near Newcastle upon Tyne. He is currently working on a book and exhibition project with the Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art in Sunderland exploring the political and social history of his home region.

The job was a deliberate e into an abyss before I could come to my senses. But if you’re teetering on the edge of writing a first book, take note: I recommend it. Leap before you look. The tools do appear.I was out of work in London at the time, due not only to a mystifying arts CV but the wrong hair and a shortfall of buzzwords. I hadn’t much to lose, which removed some excess pressure, and my cultural life stretched to a chat with the fruiterer on Streatham High Road – so there was time. More crucially I was soaked in feelings, 20 years of them, maybe the kind a writer secretes until the lid blows off and he writes something. Then a trigger came in the form of a TV news clip, which gave the feelings a voice.The first step on the slippery slope was realising writing a novel wouldn’t be one job. I found a lime at a stall in Balham, which was the rarest lime I’d ever tasted, full of zing without being sour, and I decided that this was how the book should taste. It was such an enigmatic thing that I couldn’t think of a mechanism, so I just aimed to get all the words down, see how they tasted and adjust them. I’m someone who ordinarily wouldn’t get past page one if it wasn’t right, I had to make a rule to ignore everything but the word count, and write like the wind. I wrote a hundred thousand words in a few weeks flat and felt as if I’d written a book. The problem was I couldn’t afford to look in case it was gibberish.Job two: get over the gibberish and look. And there were glimmers in there, there was a strong, spicy voice, the spirit of the book was flowing but nothing really happened, which brought the season of job three: turn all the talking into a world, make it move and interact, make it thwart and thwart and thwart things till the end. Back in the beginning, throwing caution to the wind, I’d felt that whatever came out in the first draft would be the whole artwork, flowing along spontaneously like a performance. But I now found I was wrong: the spirit was written for me, but the glimmers themselves wanted the effort of a structure, a shape to live and breathe in. There were seeds already there in the blur of the pages, so I dug them up, extracting each one into a document of its own to expand in isolation.I think this was probably doing it backwards, but it managed the focus of the work, made the book a contraption that could be polished piece by piece, a barrel organ you could start to crank and hear little pipe blasts from. It might be common in new writers to imagine that a book will – or should – tumble out in all its dimensions from the start, but this expectation alone is probably why so much great potential work is still in a drawer somewhere. Getting the job of words out of the way, good or bad, gave me a mass of raw material to mould into shape. The book itself knew what it wanted to be, there was a tailwind behind some parts more than others, which showed the direction of travel.I just followed, chasing the lime.• Vernon God Little won the Booker prize in 2003.

Along with her friend and co-creator Laura, Charlie sets out for Clipim, a fictional island off the west coast of Ireland where her father was the only survivor of an unspeakable tragedy in the 1960s. Something doesn’t add up about his story. Can the not-quite British, not-quite-Irish Charlie uncover the mystery, while finding a way to reconcile her confused identity? We are certainly going to find out.Charlie has never been to Ireland before. Her film is a litany of stereotypes, all shawls and staring out to sea, and she makes all the gaffes of a blow-in, including asking “if the IRA are here” in the local pub. Though being arrogant enough to make a film about a country you have never visited is within the plausible bounds of the imperialist script, it doesn’t quite ring true here, though the author tries her best to explain it.In fact, there is rather too much explication throughout, and some sloppiness in the writing. The protagonist is constantly “realising” things as the reader is manhandled through the plot: it’s like being at a puppet show and seeing all the strings. I would have appreciated more subtlety, especially as other aspects of Charlie, such as her side hustle selling nude photos on the internet, are frustratingly left blank.Where O’Donoghue nails it is in her writing about women who make art, female collaboration, and identity. Here she is witty, tender and insightful, especially on the way oppression bleeds its way through the generations. “My great-grandfather’s family were very poor and very Catholic and spent the latter years of the nineteenth century either fleeing the country or dying of starvation,” she writes. “It’s one hundred years later and his closest living ancestor is living on the poverty line in a building where her post gets stolen.” O’Donoghue is a perceptive, clever writer, and there’s a hint of a more powerful novel inside this fun, plotty mystery.• Scenes of a Graphic Nature is published by Virago (£16.99).

The Three Women author on why it’s time to let go of the tyranny of the ‘good’ mother Never in my life had I been so high.I’d just given a reading in Amsterdam after which the gracious hosts of the evening took me out for drinks. Three young women asked me questions about sex and love and desire as though I were an expert and it was nice but I was tired and unused to being considered an expert in anything but panic.I thanked the hosts and slipped out. I’d always wanted to visit Amsterdam and I had only two nights. I wanted to walk the streets alone. I wanted to walk across the bridges and look at the waving water and look inside the windows of the closed shops. I wanted to find the loveliest cafe and mark it for the morning. I wanted to eat bitterballen and wash them down with stroopwaffel. And I wanted to get high.The streets were dark with rain. I found a deli. It wasn’t one of the coffeeshops with the meticulously bagged furry sativa. This was just a deli, cartons of milk, packs of gum. Before leaving I bought one large plastic tub of marijuana brownies. It seemed wasteful not to, and the man assured me I absolutely could take the cookies on my flight to Romania early the next morning. OK yes why not yes yes is OK yes. He was equal parts aloof and confident and not understanding what I was saying. So it felt right.In the hour that followed I held the joint with one hand and a broken umbrella with the other. I walked and smoked and the cherry kept going out on the joint and I didn’t have a lighter and so twice I stopped to ask strangers for a light and tried to balance the umbrella and the joint and the unwieldy weight of my embarrassment. I got so high that I didn’t feel panic about my imminent flight. I got so high that I didn’t get lost. I found my pretty hotel but had gotten so high that I forgot my four-year-old daughter was sleeping in a room upstairs.Hang on now. Her father was in the room with her. But I almost forgot I was a mother. But that’s not it. I forgot enough about my panic that I wasn’t acting like the neurotic mother that I am. I rarely drink and when I do, I don’t drink much. So that getting high (so high) felt like a real breach. I got so high that I didn’t care that I got so high.To some (or many!) I’m sure I would be considered in that moment (or many!) a bad mother. I know it for a fact because I spoke to hundreds of women for my book – many of them mothers – and they all had at some point been called “bad”. Many of them believed it to the extent that they felt they weren’t good enough for their children.One of the women I spoke to was a talented musician. She told me that the only one of her singles that underperformed told the story of a bad mother. It was one of her favourite songs, but she had to stop singing it at concerts because she would receive death threats on Twitter. One listener threatened to kidnap her child, because she was too bad a mother to keep her.Asked by an avid reader to recommend a book by Elena Ferrante, I told her to check out The Lost Daughter. She called me a week later to tell me the book was despicable, how could I have suggested it? I asked her what it was about the novel that she found so odious. “What do you mean?!”, she asked. “The mother abandons her children for several years!” I said, “OK, but it’s not your mother. And also, it’s a novel.”Last year I took my then four-year-old on my book tour, and was often asked why I didn’t leave her at home. I gave a number of valid reasons, and was perplexed by how incredulous people were at my choices, at others’ choices. I was surprised by how very many of us – both men and women – can simply not help commenting on someone else’s motherhood. Calling women bad mothers is an international pastime.Mothers who leave their children for months at a time for a job are called bad mothers. The child will forget your face. Mothers who never leave their children are called bad mothers. How will the child be able to separate from you if you never leave her side. There must be an acceptable middle ground – a mother who leaves her child the perfect amount of times and tucks her in the perfect amount of times. It would be an intriguing experiment to explore what that number might be.In the middle of this pandemic being a good mother has more definitions than ever. I hear from women daily about the way their partners and colleagues and friends make them feel like bad mothers if they can’t roast something the size of a football, or sous vide something the shape of a salmon, and work full time and be the primary caretaker of the child. We have regressed to a 1950s interpretation of motherhood.One of my friends, a single mother, recently confessed that when her daughter was an infant – who cried through the night and slept only one or two hours at a time – she had recurring thoughts about abandoning her on the steps of a church. She was shocked that the thought had even come into her brain. The retro cliche of it, the snow falling over the wicker baby basket as the church door opens to the cry of a forsaken child. She would never do it, she said, but she was afraid to say it out loud, to admit that she had the thought at all. When I told her I’d heard similar things from a number of mothers, she began to cry, grateful to know she wasn’t alone.She went on to say that she didn’t know what she would have done if her daughter had been an infant during this pandemic. How exponentially harder it would have been for her – I shudder to think if she would still be mine, or if she would be with another family, one with a good mother.I’ve heard so many mothers say how much more they panic now. The pandemic is a good excuse to let that panic roam free, to let it ride bareback into Boots, galloping the gauntlet of the unmasked in the “Cold \u0026amp flu” aisle.But anxiety, I have been told so many times, makes for a bad mother. I’ve been told that I need to get my panic under control or my child will suffer the consequences. This started during pregnancy. My (unmeasured) cortisol levels were too high, my child would be born panicky, colicky, requiring of infant therapy. Being nervous is not good for the baby. That neonatal judgment did not, as you might imagine, alleviate my anxiety.The mothers I know who are more anxious than ever, or those who are now experiencing anxiety for the first time, are afraid to tell their friends for fear they will be seen as lesser, weaker mothers. In addition to roasting and sous viding and baby-wearing and account-managing and storyboarding, mothers are also supposed to maintain morale. Talking to some people about freaking out is infinitely worse than freaking out.I used to suffer daily panic attacks. I wouldn’t leave my home because I didn’t know when one might hit me. I didn’t go out with friends because I didn’t want to pass out over overpriced Negronis. I cancelled a trip to South America with my best friend because I was sure I had a brain tumour. One night I became violently sick from a bad oyster, but I was sure it was something more dire I left the door to my apartment cracked so that my body would be found before it began to stink. I was a considerate hypochondriac. I am not entirely better. My panic is a wetsuit that fits snugly. I would be naked and cold if I took it off.After my parents had died I sold my childhood home and moved into an apartment. I became close friends with an older woman who lived next door. She was the perfect age to be my new mother. One day I had a shark bite of a panic attack while I was sipping motherly chamomile in her motherishly decorated apartment. She didn’t know how to handle it. She’d never had a panic attack in her life. I felt alone. She asked me if she should call an ambulance. I said I had an ambulance in my apartment, by which I meant a Xanax.I dragged myself, shaking, back to my place. Being lonely is better than being with someone who doesn’t understand your brand of pain. My own mother, who was many things both good and bad, was at the very least an expert in panic. And now the baton has been passed to me and I like to think of it as a superpower, because I am able to fathom the panic and dread of other mothers, and I am able to see how our judgment of one another makes the panic worse, and thus, the pandemic even more unlivable.One of the three women in my book, Lina, is a housewife in rural Indiana whose husband had recently told her he no longer wanted to kiss her on the mouth. She had gone numb, walking through life like a zombie. Then she reconnected with Aidan, a former high school lover. Reconnected is the wrong word. The right word could be found in the back of her Suburban, between her panties and his crushed pack of cigarettes.But that relationship was fraught, too. He was married and unavailable in every other sense as well. He exclusively saw her when it was convenient for him. She would sometimes drive four hours to see him for 30 minutes. In the early stages of researching Lina’s story, I described to several people the way she moved mountains to meet Aidan and the way that, sometimes he would just not show up. While they don’t surprise me any longer, back then the reactions shocked me. People said she was an idiot. That she should have known better, and done better, because she was a mother. A bad mother. I learned which parts of a story would help people understand, and which parts would incite disgust.There was a time when Lina hadn’t heard from Aidan for two weeks. Her older son was at the table doing homework. Her younger son was tugging at her shirt. The house was swallowing her. She was frying an egg in a pan and the butter bubbled and spat in her face. Her child continued pulling, craving the attention of his mother. She felt that her children didn’t have the mother they deserved. Specifically her younger son, who had never seen his mother happy. She considered how killing herself might be an act of mercy. Her voice grew quiet and I worried so much that she might actually do it that I drove to her house and sat with her.I left this part out of the book because I knew it was too dark for some people. That certain people would find her story distasteful, her actions reprehensible. I knew other women would condemn Lina for not being strong for her children. For choosing her desire. But it wasn’t her desire she was choosing. She just wanted to stop suffering the kind of pain that made her breathing feel like drowning.As the pandemic has persisted, however, many women now know someone who’s said they don’t know how to go on. The same mothers who called Lina a bad mother are now telling me that they understand why she considered killing herself. It makes it easier to survive if you know other people have hit rock bottom and have gotten better. The pandemic has been quite the equaliser. A few months after I left that apartment building to panic elsewhere, the would-be mother of mine called to tell me she’d had her first panic attack. She was on antidepressants. She realised, now, what it had been like for me all those years ago. She felt sorry she wasn’t there for me in the way that I needed. She apologised even though she didn’t need to because, bad or good, she wasn’t, in the end, my mother.That night in Amsterdam I got so high that I came down with a violent case of the munchies. It was too late for room service. I nearly cried. But then I remembered. The deli bag! The brownies!I fumbled with the plastic tub and it made one of those terrible, shameful eating-in-the-night noises. The two un-high iniduals in the room stirred. My daughter’s stuffed narwhal glared at me soberly. Get lost, Narwhal, I may have said out loud.Then I cracked the lid. The smell wafted – gorgeous, chocolatey and herbaceous. I didn’t consider the consequences. I ate the brownies because they were all I had. I ate them all. Then I brushed my teeth for over an hour. I remember thinking, I have finally unlocked the key to brushing my teeth. I remember also thinking how freeing it felt to be less worried than usual. To see my daughter in her bed with her little animals, and be able to think just about how much I loved her without the attendant worries of something terrible happening.In the morning my husband had a hard time waking me. I was dismayed to find that I was still high. I was still hungry. I felt like a bad mother. But my teeth were very, very clean.I dragged myself to the airport. I told my daughter I could not hold Narwhal, that judgmental bastard. I could not sing “Baby Shark”. I could not be fun or kind or silly or Mommy. I bought her something expensive and disposable instead. I texted a friend as we were about to board the plane. I told her all the high things I’d done and how shitty I felt, how I didn’t want to play or sing with my kid. “Am I a bad mother?” I asked?“For getting high?” she wrote. “No, not for that. But this is why you shouldn’t take her on work trips with you. I know you’re anxious. But being nervous is not good for the baby.”• Three Women by Lisa Taddeo is out in paperback (Bloomsbury)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3161307ade11d12bda1edbe4898fa3e36d1639c9/0_46_3504_2101/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a34c495798fc693662c7ecc91c35120a","title":"rick stein urges unemployed chefs to join his cornish empire","story":"Restaurateur and TV celebrity struggling to fill 39 vacancies across his 13 eateries in south-westThe TV chef and food writer Rick Stein is urging unemployed chefs in other parts of the UK to consider moving to Cornwall to work in his family’s restaurant empire.The restaurant and hotel group, which has 13 eateries, is trying to fill 39 vacancies, including for a pastry chef and junior sous chef at its famous Seafood Restaurant in Padstow.“If you have found yourself out of work due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I urge you to consider coming to Cornwall,” said Stein. “It’s thriving, and with travel bans still in place there is great hope that the staycation will extend through to early winter and bring some much-needed revenue to the locality.”With a number of local staff opting not to return to customer-facing roles, Stein said there was a need for new talent in the business. “I would love to see new members of the team coming from more hard-hit areas of the country,” he said.Azzurri Group (includes Ask Italian and Zizzi) 1,200 jobs lost and 75 restaurants closed ahead of sale to private equity firmByron 31 out of 51 restaurants closed in rescue deal, with 650 job losses.Carluccio’s Collapsed In March. About 1,200 jobs were lost when just 31 of its 73 sites were taken on by investor Ranjit Singh Boparan.Casual Dining Group (includes Cafe Rouge, Bella Italia and Las Iguanas) Closed 91 of its 250 outlets last month, with loss of 1,900 jobs.

In 2019 the group received 5,500 applications over the whole year. One demi-chef position received 111 applications, which is 10 times the usual level, the company said. For some roles there is help with accommodation.However, despite the high volume of applications, Michael Rabone, the group’s head of human resources, said it was struggling with a large number of “no-shows”.“We’ve seen a noticeable increase in the number of no-shows at all stages of the recruitment process,” said Rabone. “This includes candidates that apply and cannot be contacted, candidates invited to interview that do not attend, and iniduals offered roles that do not start work.”The family-run group has not emerged unscathed from the crisis, which forced restaurants and bars to shut for several months. There were job losses at head office and at one point it was thought that two of its venues – Porthleven and Marlborough – would have to close permanently. However, the latter was saved after the landlord reduced the rent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e13f7747ff755bcf1d814c8635752352f300e46c/151_0_4543_2726/master/4543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9480bdf469601de61b5009f2555791cb","title":"pizza ovens inflatable tents and usb charging the evolution of camping","story":"Home comforts now more desirable than ‘cutting the cord’ as technology has changed the face of modern campingIt used to be considered a low-tech holiday, but while campers who want to get off-grid can still find quiet spots to pitch up and spark up the Trangia, others are unfolding their portable pizza ovens and plugging in their projectors.Advances in technology, and the rise of glamping and festivals, mean that some holidaymakers are packing a whole range of home comforts alongside their traditional camping gear.“People are making things a bit more bespoke,” said Mike Attwooll, product buyer at the camp shop Attwoolls. “You go out for the day and back to your base at night and it’s like home.”Ten years ago electrical hook-ups were unusual, but now they are the norm, he said, as campers look to plug in phones and run equipment they would previously have left behind. He had recently seen photos of someone holding a film night in their tent using a mini-projector, he said.James Warner Smith of the website Cool Camping said technology had brought modern campers a whole range of choices. “Some guys have developed a folding pizza oven that you can take with you. It does rotisserie chicken too,” he said. “There’s a no-electricity coffee maker, and there are quite few stoves that have USB ports in them so you can charge your phone while you are cooking.” One of these, the £149.99 Tegology Tegstove, won investment on Dragons Den.Attwooll said he had recently been looking at a brochure from the 1960s and many products were the same, but that recent innovations meant better versions were available.“The most important things are what you’re sleeping under and what you’re sleeping on,” he said. Eighty-five per cent of family tents are now inflatable, and campers pump up sturdy beams instead of metal poles.Iain Geddes, senior technical adviser the Camping and Caravanning Club, said affordable inflatable tents were “one of the few big sudden changes” in the market. “Suddenly I was getting calls from people, like one from a single mum saying can I put one of these up on my own,” he said. The fact that the answer was yes has made camping accessible for some who would struggle with traditional tents.Deflating airbeds have ruined many camping trips, and are now being replaced with a new generation of self-inflating mats which offer comfort and reliability. And there have been changes in sleeping bag technology, which mean those who want a bit more comfort under canvas can get it. Attwooll cites a bag aimed at women which has thicker material at the bottom, and another – launched this year by Vango - which comes with a thermal heatpad that can be plugged into a power pack.Visit any campsite though and you will probably still see at least one bell tent. These have enjoyed a renaissance in recent years, which Warner Smith puts down, in part, to social media. “In the Instagram age people have an idea of what things should look like, so they will pitch their bell tent and put up some bunting.”He said changes were being inspired by trips to festivals, and by glamping sites that offer fixed tents, pods and shepherd’s huts beautifully decorated and kitted out with comfortable beds.“You have a lot of sites where this is a mixture of fixed tents and traditional pitches, and people are seeing the glamping and bringing some of it to their own experience,” he said. “At the same time there has been the growth of music festivals. Campsite owners have seen the food trucks and some sites will now have them at the weekend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93833394423696ba5001d6322e439fad0797b3b0/0_171_2200_1321/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6de1648eb63ff32de8c5f918783a8f11","title":"beirut explosion lawless world international shipping ","story":"The disaster has roots in a global network of maritime capital and legal chicanery designed to protect businesses at any costAt about 6pm on Tuesday, a seemingly small warehouse fire near Beirut port’s grain silos began to fizz with red sparks. The sparks led to an enormous explosion, a mushroom cloud of water and debris, and a column of orange-red and black smoke rising out of the warehouse.The shockwave pulverised nearby warehouses and apartment blocks, lifted doors off their hinges and shattered windows several miles away. At the time of writing, 154 people have been reported killed over 5,000 injured and 300,000 have been left homeless. Dozens of people are still missing.While attention and anger has focused on the incompetence and dysfunction of the Lebanese government and authorities, the roots of the catastrophe run far deeper and wider – to a network of maritime capital and legal chicanery that is designed to protect businesses at any cost.Whatever sparked the initial fire, the secondary explosion that destroyed the port and so much of the city was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored in a port warehouse. A chemical used in both agriculture and construction, ammonium nitrate is associated with the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing in London and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. It was also the cause of huge explosions in Galveston, Texas in 1947 and Tianjin port in China in 2015, both of which killed scores of people. How did such a dangerous incendiary end up in a warehouse so close to residential areas of Beirut?In September 2013, the cargo vessel the MV Rhosus – owned by a Russian, registered to a company in Bulgaria and flagged to Moldova – set sail from Batumi in Georgia to Mozambique. It carried a cargo of ammonium nitrate purchased by Fábrica de Explosivos de Moçambique, a company that makes commercial explosives. The vessel was operated by eight Ukrainian and two Russian crew members who came onboard not knowing that the previous crew had left the ship in protest at non-payment of their wages.When the Rhosus was forced by its owner to make an additional stop in Beirut to pick up more cargo, Lebanese officials impounded the ship for breaching International Maritime Organization standards and failing to pay charges including port fees. Ships can be “arrested” if they do not have the necessary paperwork, are considered unsafe or environmentally hazardous, or as a holding security payment on a debt owed, among other reasons.The ship’s owner Igor Grechushkin had registered his vessel in Moldova, where ship registry is more lax than most in enforcing labour, health and safety and environmental regulations. Open registries like these are considered “flags of convenience”, where a ship flies a flag of a country different to that of its owner.Flags of convenience were first devised by American lawyers in client states such as Panama, Liberia and Honduras. Even today, much of the profit of some of the largest open registries is expatriated to private companies in the US. The “convenience” in “flags of convenience”, according to the American essayist John McPhee, is “that taxes could be avoided, insurance could be to a considerable extent ignored, and wages attractive to shipowners could be paid to merchant sailors drawn from any part of the world”.When Grechushkin realised what the impounding of the Rhosus could cost him, he began bankruptcy proceedings and effectively abandoned the ship and its crew. The Mozambican consignees of the ammonium nitrate also forsook the cargo.Ships are abandoned by their owners with alarming regularity, often to avoid paying the crew wages they are owed. So often, in fact, that the International Labour Organization maintains an abandoned seafarers database. Sometimes an abandoned ship’s cargo is auctioned off to pay creditors, or the crew’s unpaid wages, or clean-up and disposal costs.In Lebanon, the resale of the cargo did not happen, and the authorities refused to allow four of the seafarers off the ship without a replacement crew. The captain and remaining crew members were left aboard the ship, still carrying its explosive cargo, for almost a year, with no wages, no access to electronic communications and with dwindling food and fuel provisions.In effect the crew of the Rhosus were hostages in the negotiation between the Lebanese port authorities – who did not want to assume the responsibility for the ship’s dangerous cargo – and the shipowner. In August 2014, a Lebanese judge ordered the seafarers’ release, and the 2,750-tonne cargo of ammonium nitrate was subsequently moved from the vessel to a warehouse in the port of Beirut.Although most Lebanese are rightfully outraged by the incompetence of the Lebanese authorities, the deadly dealings of international maritime capital are also to blame.Not all countries of the world are signatories to the international maritime treaties that regulate working conditions and dangerous cargo. Even if they were, many states do not have the resources to pursue claims against unscrupulous shipping companies. Further, international disputes between governments and foreign investors are rarely decided in favour of governments.Flags of convenience, essentially an offshoring tool intended to protect capital, allow unsafe ships to sail with crews who are vulnerable to the depredations of unscrupulous employers. Even the wealthiest shipping companies in the world, with headquarters in Europe and east Asia, flag their ships to open registries to save on wages, taxes and insurance.The removal of these offshoring provisions, eliminating flags of convenience, and an overhaul of the arbitration mechanisms that so often disadvantage seafarers and less powerful states are only the first steps towards addressing the malfeasance that created Tuesday’s tragedy. As the dust settles in Beirut, there is a great deal of work to be done.• Laleh Khalili is professor of international politics at Queen Mary University of London and author of Sinews of War and Trade: Shipping and Capitalism in the Arabian Peninsula"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f761053676f52dda8baa7b1ed6eb1311e76fa9/0_31_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02dc3666fd7a0154ceea52477ee21a31","title":"first cat uk covid 19 panic feline coronavirus","story":"The feline had caught coronavirus from its owners, but our research shows it’s a rare occurrenceSince the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, the potential role of animals in catching and spreading the disease has been closely examined by scientists. This is because the virus that causes Covid-19 belongs to the family of coronaviruses that cause disease in a variety of mammals.The evidence suggests that this virus arose in bats, and my colleagues at the University of Glasgow have recently determined that the sub-type of coronavirus to which the virus belongs has been circulating in the bat population since the 1940s.So it makes sense for researchers to ponder whether the virus can be transmitted to companion animals, whether these animals can show symptoms of infection and whether they may play any role in the epidemiology of the disease.Cats are the UK’s most popular pet – a 2019 survey revealed there are almost 11 million felines in households across the country. Public concern about felines was initially raised when tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo in New York were found to be infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19.There have also been sporadic reports of cats from Covid-19 households in Hong Kong, Belgium, France, Spain and the US that have tested positive for the virus.So, could our domestic cat population be somehow involved in the pandemic in the UK? We decided to find out.In early May, my colleagues and I were given ethical approval to retrospectively test cats for Sars-CoV-2 and work soon began screening routine respiratory samples taken from cats throughout the UK. We also launched an appeal to veterinary surgeons asking for samples from suspect cases.After screening hundreds of samples, this collaborative effort eventually resulted in the detection of a cat with Sars-CoV-2 in the south of England, which had been sampled in mid-May. Further samples submitted to our veterinary colleagues at the Animal and Plant Health Agency revealed this cat had developed an antibody response to the virus, demonstrating that it had indeed experienced a genuine infection and confirming it was not a simple case of sample contamination. Circumstances indicate the cat contracted the virus from its owners, who had previously tested positive for Covid-19.At this point, the World Organisation for Animal Health was notified by the UK chief veterinary officer and the press was alerted. We are currently preparing a paper on our findings for publication.So, what does this case tell us? Our research coincided with the UK Covid-19 outbreak, focusing on cats experiencing respiratory symptoms. Our finding of a single infected inidual among the hundreds screened tells us that infection in cats is relatively uncommon. This is reinforced by the fact that the other cat in the household never became infected, either by the owners or the infected cat.Although the cat had been experiencing mild symptoms, including runny eyes and a snotty nose, these signs were consistent with feline herpesvirus infection, for which this cat also tested positive. There is no evidence that Sars-CoV-2 was making this cat ill and, thankfully, the cat and its owners have all made a full recovery.It is important to appreciate that while, to date, about 19 million people have tested positive for Covid-19, only a handful of infected cats have been detected around the world.All available evidence suggests, therefore, that cats are not involved in spreading Covid-19. However, the importance of this type of animal surveillance work is clear, considering that a million mink have recently been culled in the Netherlands and Spain as they have been implicated in disease spread.Our suspicion in the case of cats is that feline infections simply represent a “spillover” from the human epidemic, and we are currently analysing the genome sequence of the virus from the case we found to investigate this hypothesis.Our results and those from other studies, such as work in the US showing experimentally infected cats were only transiently infected, can provide reassurance to the pet-owning public.It’s very unlikely your cat has coronavirus, and if it does, it probably won’t be involved in spreading it any further.• Willie Weir is professor of veterinary infectious disease at the University of Glasgow.

We have seen from Scotland’s press coverage that it’s all too easy to fixate on the difference between the teacher-assessed grades and the final grades. But it’s a misleading distraction and misinforms the public. The teacher grades were an important part of the process but always only going to be a part.“On results day, energy should be channelled into how each young person can progress swiftly with what they have been awarded, rather than time lost on agonising over an apparently controversial but fundamentally misleading difference between teacher grades and final grades.”Statisticians have criticised Ofqual’s algorithm, saying it does not have sufficient data to award grades fairly to most state schools in England, because of wide variations in results within schools and between years.The Royal Statistical Society has called for an urgent review of the statistical procedures used in England and Scotland, to be carried out by the UK Statistics Authority. “This should consider both the substantive issues of the data used and the adjustment algorithms of the various nations, but also whether greater transparency would have been possible and beneficial,” the society said.“It gives the public the impression that in most cases the grades the student receive would still be the predicted grades. However, closer analysis shows that this is not true,” Duong said.In response, a spokesperson for Ofqual said: “From the data that we have reviewed we expect the majority of grades students receive will be the same as their centre assessment grades, and almost all grades students receive will be the same as the centre assessment grades or within one grade. The exact proportions vary by subject and we will publish the figures on results day.”But Duong also found that a comprehensive secondary school can have a huge annual variation in results for inidual courses, with the small numbers of entries involved suggesting that Ofqual’s decisions are statistically invalid.Duong said: “These fluctuations mean that Ofqual’s statistical modelling cannot make sense. The problem is that any statistical model is only as good as the data you feed it, and for a typical comprehensive school, there simply isn’t enough A-level data from 2017 to 2019 for any statistical modelling.”In response, Ofqual said: “For A-level, three years of historical results inform the standardisation of grades. You can think of this as an averaging across the years of data.”Uncertainty over the grades being awarded has led universities to say they will relax offers to prospective students and make use of other data.Admissions officers for Peterhouse College, Cambridge, said during a Q\u0026ampA on the Student Room website: “We are looking into which schools (from among our offer holders) are most likely to be adversely affected by the system of awarded grades so we are in a better position to make nuanced decisions when we get the results.”In a significant sign that it recognised the controversy likely to erupt on Thursday when students receive A-level results, Ofqual this week changed its position and said schools would be able to appeal if they expected “a very different pattern of grades to results in previous years”. But Ofqual will not allow inidual students to appeal against their grades on academic grounds, as they can in Scotland.For A-level pupils, teacher assessments will only be used to help set grades on small courses, with five or fewer candidates. On larger courses, teacher assessment will play little or no role, with grades being awarded instead based on a school’s recent exam history and each pupil’s previous exam results.The pupils most likely to benefit from teacher assessments will be those taking courses with very small entries of five pupils or less, such as German or music. Those taking popular subjects such as maths or biology, with more than 15 pupils, will be exposed to Ofqual’s algorithm and the teacher assessment will be ignored.Kate Green, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “The government should have ensured that Ofqual had a robust appeals system in place from the beginning, instead of announcing one a matter of days before A-level results. They must do far more to ensure the system is genuinely fair.”Students unhappy with their results have the option of sitting exams in autumn. But with students entering university or college, few are expected to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92affcac648deb900f6acbfe2721cfebf04fe3fd/0_2_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd587107860917497dec10dcbba5d1c","title":"a level students tell us how youre feeling about getting your results","story":"We’d like to hear from sixth form students about the upcoming results dayThis week, the Scottish Qualifications Authority came under fire after admitting it downgraded nearly a quarter of all the recommended A-level results, heightening existing fears that school leavers’ grades would be negatively impacted by the pandemic across the UK.However, some assessment experts have said that this year’s results, based on a combination of teachers’ recommendations, class ranking and the past performance of their schools, and statistical modelling by examiners, will be fairer than ever.As results day approaches, we’d like to hear from students about how they’re feeling, and what they’re expecting.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

The administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland did the same with their exams.Grades in England will be “standardised”, taking into account teachers’ assessments and class rankings, a student’s prior attainment (GCSE results for those taking A-levels, and Sats for those taking GCSEs), and their school’s performance in recent years.The influence of teacher assessments will vary depending on the numbers taking a school’s courses: a course with five or fewer candidates will use the assessments in deciding grades, but larger courses with more than 15 candidates will ignore assessments and rely on prior attainment and a school’s previous results.Teachers will still have a major say by creating the class rankings that will distribute grades. A pupil put at the top of the ranking will receive the highest grade allotted to that school by Ofqual.Ofqual says its system is designed to ensure this year’s results are in line with those of previous years. But last week’s exam results day in Scotland was described as a “shambles” after close to 125,000 predicted grades – a quarter of the total – were adjusted by the Scottish Qualifications Authority. Only about 9,000 went up during the process.Now all eyes are on England because the statistical model being used to predict English exam results shares basic principles with the Scottish one.Education experts in England warn that students in rapidly improving schools – likely to be in the most disadvantaged areas – may be penalised for previous poor results. Jon Coles, the head of the biggest academy trust in England and a former official at the Department for Education, has said Ofqual’s data shows the previous years’ results cannot accurately predict this year’s for most schools. That will be particularly true for rapidly improving schools.MPs have said they are especially worried about black, Asian and minority ethnic pupils, and those with special educational needs.Yes. They can argue on a number of grounds, including if the school has been through a major change of leadership that has turned around its teaching record. Schools can also challenge results if they were expecting “exceptional” results compared with previous years, or if past results were distorted by a “monumental event” such as a flood or fire, or the school has undergone substantial demographic change, such as from being a single-sex school to a mixed one.Not on academic grounds. They can appeal through their school or college, but only on the grounds that the process was not followed correctly. If they suspect their grade was influenced by bias or discrimination, they can appeal against malpractice through their school or exam centre.Yes. They can sit A-level exams in October or GCSE exams in November. But the offer is unpopular with headteachers, who fear that revising for GCSE “retakes” will cut into teaching time for pupils in the first year of their A-level course.Ofqual revealed that predicted grades submitted by schools and colleges were about 12 percentage points higher than last year’s outcomes at A-level, and nine percentage points higher at GCSE – with peaks at key grades such as 4 at GCSE, which is a pass, and B at A-level, which can be required for university entrance.“Improvement on such a scale in a single year has never occurred, and to allow it would significantly undermine the value of these grades for students,” the regulator said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9669db19e48e3a9805863dc689d636390f12f0bc/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=cef4e24533250d7806e61aff5b23dfd2","title":"thousands of baby turtles released into sea off bali","story":"The Olive Ridley turtles are part of conservationists’ attempts to boost the population and promote environmental protectionMore than 10,000 baby turtles were released into the sea off the Indonesian island of Bali, as part of conservationists’ attempts to boost the population of a vulnerable species and promote environmental protection.Conservation groups carried crates each full of dozens of tiny turtles to the island’s Gianyar beach on Friday and encouraged local people and volunteers to line up on the sand and release the hatchlings together.The turtles, just a few inches long, scurried over the black sand and pebbles as the tide splashed over them.“It’s really exciting to see all of these turtles being released into the wild,” said American volunteer Jessica Lieberman, adding she hoped they would survive.The Olive Ridley turtles are among the most abundant sea turtles but are still considered vulnerable because there are few places in which they will nest. The turtles typically weigh 34-50kg as an adult and grow to 60-70cm long.Flavianus Erwin Putranto, a conservation volunteer, said turtle eggs were appearing in fewer places on Bali than before, but programmes to help protect them were seeing success. “We are able to collect and save them. Hopefully we can hatch more turtles and release them back into the ocean,” he said.Sea turtle populations have declined in recent years due to hunting, loss of beach nesting sites, over-harvesting of their eggs and being caught in fishing gear.Bali authorities released 25 of the larger green turtles into the sea on Wednesday after their rescue last month during a raid on illegal traffickers.Agus Budi Santoso, head of the Bali Natural Resources and Conservation Centre, recommended creating a “green zone” of designated beaches for turtles to lay eggs safely, away from hotels.

But on the other hand they’re perfect for a world in which you don’t have to worry about your boss seeing your toes. According to Jesse Burnett, co-founder of footwear brand Tkees: “With remote work more popular than ever, buying patterns no longer have to centre around office attire or what someone’s workplace might deem acceptable”.The way everyone dresses has been shifting. Flip-flops are symptomatic of the new ease that has taken over our wardrobes – elasticated waists are in and flips flops are their footwear equivalent.“Today, consumers are buying what they want to wear, rather than what they have to wear,” says Burnett. In this context, flip flops, along with other comfortable, “ugly” shoes such as Birkenstocks and Crocs, are doing well.Even in high-fashion, a world in which the impractical is often celebrated, influencers are teaming flip-flops with the oversized, forgiving dresses that have taken over Instagram feeds this summer. Net-a-Porter’s global buying director Elizabeth von der Goltz cites their street style moment during Copenhagen fashion week, “where Scandinavian girls were spotted incorporating Havaianas into their outfits”, as one reason they might now be having their moment in the sun.The specific context of 2020 to one side, there are many things to recommend the beachy classic. “It is an exquisitely concise form of footwear,” says Elizabeth Semmelhack, senior curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Canada. “It does a very effective job of protecting the foot with a minimal amount of material.”While in politics to “flip-flop” is a bad thing – see Boris Johnson’s jibe that Keir Starmer has “more flip-flops than Bournemouth beach” – it is the shoe’s malleability that means it can be all things to all people.The simple design can be riffed on, made fun with bright colours, or minimal with neutral tones – the luxe leather and suede platform take from New York brand The Row is proving to be one of Net a Porter’s most popular styles, according to von der Goltz, “in spite of the high price point” – they would be available for £725 if they weren’t already sold out.For such an easy breezy summer classic, there is a lot of contention about the flip-flop’s roots. Many people cite the Ancient Egyptians as the style’s forefathers – they weaved theirs out of grass, papyrus or palm leaves. Or, in the case of Tutankhamun, had them decorated with gold, birch bark and even bone.In 2020 the flip-flop is breaking new ground: perfect for staycations, gardening and popping to the shop, they are also, for the many office workers now confined to kitchens and bedrooms, the perfect footwear for board meetings and brainstorming sessions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29c440804dc82c27103d591d40d8b5b04e2aba08/0_1764_3066_1840/master/3066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=345409b412b02d1e783de12a8267b199","title":"meera sodha vegan recipe peach and strawberry hand pies","story":"There’s something about finger food that appeals to all of us – especially if it’s fruity, sweet and stickyI was raised around an Indian kitchen table, which meant I ate with my hands. There was no designated “finger food”: it was all finger food, which is why I have a particular fondness for any dish that suggests, in name or form, that you don’t need cutlery to eat it. These American-style hand pies are a case in point: they are essentially neat little sugared parcels crammed with as much fruit as you can squeeze in. Peaches and strawberries are my favourites, though you can use any fruit that will go jammy and soft and boil out of the top of pastry, creating a chewy, pastille-like jelly that you can peel off with your teeth when the pies have cooled.If you don’t feel like making your own pastry, use a 500g block of readymade vegan shortcrust pastry such as Jus-Rol, and skip to the part in the method where you heat the oven.For the pastry (or use 500g readymade)300g plain flour, plus extra for dusting ¼ tsp fine sea salt2 tbsp icing sugar150g sunflower spread – I like BionaFor the filling2 peaches (200g), stoned and chopped into 1cm pieces100g strawberries, hulled and chopped into 1cm pieces2 tbsp cornflour 2 tsp vanilla bean paste Zest and juice of ½ lemon4 tbsp icing sugar Big pinch of ground black pepper 3 tbsp non-dairy milk1 tbsp granulated sugarTo make the pastry, put the flour, salt, icing sugar and sunflower spread in a bowl and rub together with your fingertips until the mix is the consistency of breadcrumbs. Pour in two tablespoons of cold water and stir with a wooden spoon until it comes together into a dough.

Line two baking trays with greaseproof paper. To make the filling, in a bowl, combine the peaches, strawberries, cornflour, vanilla, lemon zest and juice, icing sugar and pepper.Lightly dust a work surface with flour and roll out the pastry to 2-3mm thick. Using a 12cm cutter (or a small bowl), cut out 10 circles you’ll probably need to re-roll the pastry scraps to get the final few circles out.Take one pastry circle and spoon a heaped tablespoon of the filling (leaving behind any liquid) on the right-hand half. Fold over the left-hand side, to create an enclosed, half-moon-shaped pie. Use a fork to crimp around the edges to seal and make a rough pattern. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling.Transfer the pies to the lined trays, brush with the milk, then slash the top of each pie and sprinkle over the granulated sugar. Bake in the centre of the oven for 20-25 minutes, until deeply golden brown, and don’t worry if the pies explode a little – that’s all part of their charm.

Sometimes, my daydreaming would guide me to a little bakery I’d not seen before, its window full of pastries, cakes and tarts laden with berries. It’s been a while since I’ve had such a day, but even without wandering and daydreaming, I do still have time in my life for tart.Frozen berries would also work well inn this filling, although in that case you may need to add a little sugar – they tend to be more sour than fresh ones.For the mousse400g summer fruits (eg, a mixture of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries)100g granulated or caster sugar2 large egg yolks3 leaves gelatine, soaked in cold water200g double creamFor the pastry150g plain flour3 pinches table salt40g icing sugar75g unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes1 large egg, separatedFor the jelly150g fruit coulis (reserved from the mousse – see method)1 leaf gelatine, soaked in cold waterTo decorateA couple of handfuls of mixed summer berriesTo make the pastry, blitz the flour, salt, sugar and butter together in a food processor to a breadcrumb consistency.With the motor still going, add in the yolk, followed by a little of the white, until the mix starts to clump together – you will not need all of the white.

Once the pastry has chilled, dust a rolling pin and worktop with flour, then roll out the dough to 3mm thick. Roll the dough up over the rolling pin and unroll over the tin.

Stir in the drained soaked gelatine leaves and leave to cool to room temperature.When lukewarm, whisk up the double cream until airy but still pourable (if you over-whisk to soft peaks, then stir though a little more cream until liquid again). Fold the cream through the fruit mix until just combined, then pour into the pastry case.

Juventus were eliminated on the away goal rule after their round of 16 tie against Lyon ended 2-2 on aggregate following their 2-1 win over the Ligue 1 side on Friday.Sarri, 61, has been in charge for one season and has been widely criticised by the Italian media despite leading Juventus to a ninth successive Serie A title last month.“The balance of the season is obviously bittersweet,” Agnelli told Sky Sport Italia. “The season was very difficult, we wrote a fantastic page with the ninth title and especially with a coach who started in the amateur leagues to reach the highest point.The Champions League is obviously a disappointment for us, the players and the fans,” he added. “We will take a few days to consider, evaluate everything and discuss how to go forward for next season.”Despite their domestic dominance, Juventus haven’t lifted the Champions League trophy since 1996. “The Champions League has been a dream for us, but now it must become an objective,” said Agnelli.He was convinced that 35-year-old Ronaldo, who he described as the best player in the history of the Champions League, would remain for the third and final year of his contract. “He’s a pillar of Juventus,” said Agnelli."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00611d3d6bf6e33edc8b4f90d02dcad8897980de/0_217_3135_1880/master/3135.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e15752f01a397e4c7289ddf065cf845c","title":"how to control aphids in your garden","story":"Hoverfly larvae devour blackfly, so welcome them by planting the umbels they loveI’m not sure about your garden, but mine has been awash with blackfly (Aphis fabae) this year. They started on their namesake, the broad beans, hopped over the nasturtiums and are now having fun on the runner beans and numerous flowers, from chrysanthemums to dahlias. I’ve been patiently waiting for the ladybird larvae to deal with them, but they are late this year I assume the wet winter decimated overwinter adults.Adult hoverflies are identifiable by their compound eyes and single pair of wings with prominent veins. Unlike flies, many have black and yellow, wasp- or bee-like markings and are often furry (they are good mimics of wasps and bees) and, as their name suggests, they love to hover before alighting to drink.The larvae aren’t as easy to spot, as they are tiny and frankly ugly. They do have one or two distinct markings, though: usually longitudinal stripes of white, yellow or brown blotches, unlike other hoverfly larvae which are pale yellowish-white. Their colouring acts as camouflage because if you are hunting aphids, you will have to move about and this puts you at risk their markings break up their outline, making them harder for predators to see.They add to their strange-looking aspect with an equally strange-looking dance. To prevent its prey sending off too many alarm signals, the larvae rears up its head, lifts the aphid off the leaf and pierces it. They produce sticky saliva so the aphid can’t wriggle away, and proceed to suck the life out of it. The larvae may want the soft, plump bodies of aphids, but the adult flies want nectar and pollen. Hoverflies dine on all sorts of flowers, from spring hawthorn to ivy in autumn. They do, however, seem to be particularly fond of umbels, so it makes sense to fill your garden with them. Perhaps the simplest way to start is to let your coriander go to seed and watch who visits.If neither hoverflies nor ladybirds appear, the simplest way to tackle a small infestation of blackfly is to squish them with your finger and thumb. If a plant becomes heavily infested, uproot it. Once blackfly establish themselves, they multiply rapidly and are often farmed by ants that love the honeydew the aphids excrete. Ants will also remove aphid predators such as ladybirds and hoverfly, so compost the lot before they take over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39d1ea8ab7c4eb4c2290e94b3eee4c51547d30e3/263_211_4827_2896/master/4827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=588ca13f7004b3687116ee8f9ee8521b","title":"simon mayo interview bbc insider said too ugly for television","story":"The radio presenter and author on missing the Ramones, José Mourinho, and his embarrassing birthday moment with Naomi CampbellBorn in London, Simon Mayo, 61, joined BBC Radio 1 in 1986 and presented Radio 2 Drivetime from 2010 to 2018.

He was 57.Known for his cheeky asides and huge laugh, Morris – known to his colleagues as Mozzer – asked powerful people the no-nonsense questions that viewers were shouting at the telly at home.When the then prime minister, David Cameron, came on the programme to defend tax changes that would hit the poorest workers hardest, Morris said: “You can afford to do that – you’re minted.” He also took Tony Blair to task over the exorbitant cost of childcare.A book of condolence set up by ITV has been signed by more than 2,500 people. Bury hospice, which looked after Morris in his final weeks, has received £12,700 in donations since his death on 1 August, as well as cards from around the country.Colleagues recalled his ability to connect with people who struggled, having grown up in care and joined the RAF aged 16. He was in his late 20s and had two young daughters when he became a BBC radio trainee in 1992, having worked as a DJ and sold insurance after leaving the armed forces.Born to Jamaican parents, he had been fostered by a white woman called Audrey, who looked after him until adulthood on a Portsmouth council estate.Lucy Meacock, a Granada presenter for 32 years, said Morris formed an immediate connection with the audience when he joined her in 2003. “He had it tough growing up, and because of that he always had a kindness and an understanding of those who had it tough too,” she said.He never feared speaking truth to power, she recalled. “He had a great art for asking the direct question, everything that viewers at home were thinking when they heard someone powerful say something and thought: come off it.”She remembered Morris refusing to go to an awards ceremony early in his ITV career, saying: “The only other black people there will be waiting on tables.” Within years he was winning Baftas, and in February this year – two months after being diagnosed with cancer – he was shortlisted for the Royal Television Society awards in the nations and regions presenter of the year category.Morris’s eldest daughter, Natalie, now a journalist at  UK, said he never viewed himself as a role model. “It’s undeniable that he was a role model, but that was incidental for him,” she said.“I know now how difficult it can be being the only non-white face in newsroom meetings but he was doing it 20 years ago. It can’t have been easy but it’s a testament to his talent and his resilience how he broke down these barriers and paved the path for a new generation.”Granada Reports had a better track record than many media organisations of promoting black and minority ethnic talent even before Morris’s arrival, with Juliet Alexander and Sohail Rahman appearing regularly on screen.But in becoming a teatime TV institution, Morris became a hero to the black communities of the north-west, said his colleague Jahmal Williams-Thomas, a Granada camera operator turned reporter who grew up in Manchester’s Moss Side.“Watching Tony on TV when I was younger, it felt like he was one of the family. My nan is Jamaican and she absolutely loved him – apart from Trevor McDonald he was one of the few black faces reading the news at the time,” he said. “Tony was a massive inspiration to me and the black community. Whenever we do stories now in places like Moss Side, people always ask: ‘Wow, do you know Tony Morris, that big guy off the telly?’”Sometimes black communities think mainstream news is not for them, said Williams-Thomas. “I got a bit of that when I started out in journalism. ‘It’s a bit of a white thing, that’ … Having people like Tony was massive for us. A person that showed us if he can do it, then so can I.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82cf65fe6bdd4dda410c354ba392602ea2881cd8/0_292_5840_3505/master/5840.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b7757b6fe21e4bbb92e3203df8c16fdc","title":"how the world is coping with coronavirus six months on","story":"From Portugal to Pakistan, the ’s international correspondent Michael Safi looks at the different ways countries have been affected by the virus and the impact that is having on the lives of people thereIt’s six months since Covid-19 was registered as an urgent threat, and although the panic at the scenarios that filled imaginations in those first weeks – of millions of imminent deaths, medical systems buckling and food supplies running scarce – has largely abated, the virus has not.

Seventy years since the inaugural world championship, the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix at Silverstone will honour a rich, fascinating story.On Sunday Silverstone will host the 1,023rd F1 world championship race since this circuit held the first on 13 May 1950. Then, professionals and enthusiastic amateurs had already been racing what were known as grands prix for decades. In 1950 the fledgling Féderation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) brought regulation and structure to present one competition: the Formula One World Championship.The King and Queen were at Silverstone to watch. Alfa Romeo, dominant at the time, drove their cars on the public roads to the circuit from Banbury but Ferrari, the only team to have competed in every one of those 70 years, were not present at that opening round, still preparing their cars for the second meeting at Monaco.It was a different age in every way. There were the ubiquitous hay bales lining the circuit, the officials housed in a double decker bus, oil-streaked drivers, oil-streaked mechanics wielding tools recognisable to all, the ner not the laptop. When Alfa’s Giuseppe Farina won the race he did so in a linen helmet. The drivers wore cotton shirts and trousers to stay cool in the fearsome heat generated by the heavy, front-engined cars.Since then, everyone involved with the sport and its fans has a tale to tell of what brought them to F1. Much as it is derided by naysayers as a technological competition (which it undoubtedly is, just not all it is), clearly the drivers over the years have made the greatest impression.The FIA president, Jean Todt, is no different from many fans. The 74-year-old has loved the sport since he was a child and was in charge of Ferrari from 1994 to 2007, overseeing five consecutive titles for Michael Schumacher. “It is about passion,” he says when considering F1’s 70-year history. “My passion was for Jim Clark, Dan Gurney, Jack Brabham. I never met Jim Clark, I saw him race and he was my hero. Dan Gurney was the only driver I asked for an autograph. I still have it.”Todt has a clear emotional attachment with the sport through the drivers. He is still moved when he considers the friendship he formed with the five‑time champion Juan Manuel Fangio while rallying in Argentina in the late 1970s.Similarly Todt’s former colleague at Ferrari, Ross Brawn, now sporting director at F1, shares this very personal affection. He started going to races in the 1960s with his father who worked for tyre supplier Firestone. “One of my boyhood heroes was Jim Clark, his talent matched with his shy nature made him pretty special and he raced everything,” says Brawn. “My other hero was Stirling Moss, brilliant in everything he drove and I now own one of his old racing cars.”Brawn led his own team, Brawn GP, to the 2009 title and has seen every angle of F1 since being a child peering through a fence. He has a succinct appreciation of its longevity. “Speed, heroes and rivalries. F1 provides the perfect mix that every sports fan wants. They want to be thrilled, they want to get behind someone and see them win and they want to see battles that define races and eras. Year after year F1 has given that to fans, be it Prost versus Senna, Hunt versus Lauda or Rosberg versus Hamilton. It’s always there and it’s always played out at 200mph.”These characters have been defined in many different ways. There has been sacrifice. Peter Collins, in with a shout of the championship at the last round at Monza in 1956, voluntarily handed his car to Fangio to ensure the Argentinian could take the title. “It’s too early for me to become world champion – I’m too young,” he said modestly of his chivalrous gesture. He was duly in the running to take the championship two years later until he was killed at the German GP. His friend Mike Hawthorn took the title, the first Britain to do so, but retired afterwards, inconsolable at Collins’s death.There has been bravery, not least in simply driving in a sport where the expectation of serious accidents or death had become normalised. Yet across 70 years it is hard not to consider Niki Lauda’s return to racing just six weeks after being pulled from the fiery wreckage of his car at the Nurburgring in 1976 as an outstanding act of mental and physical courage. It ranks as one of the greatest comebacks in the sport.Lauda’s analytical brilliance was only one aspect of talent that has fascinated, contrasted by the mercurial, almost otherworldly touch of Ayrton Senna. His win in 1991 in Brazil while his car was stuck in sixth gear was outstanding but surpassed by the qualifying lap at Monaco in 1988 where he was a second and half quicker than every other competitor and then Donington in 1993 in the rain, moving from fifth to first within a lap, his rivals helpless against his virtuoso technique in the trickiest of conditions.The Brazilian was a complex man and driver, not easily pigeon-holed and not least because he too could be ruthless and cynical, traits that only make these characters seem more compelling. Taking out Alain Prost at Suzuka in 1990 is as much part of the Senna legend and F1 story and has been echoed by others since.Senna’s death at Imola in 1994 also brought an urgency to the sport’s most fundamental shift in 70 years, the achievement of safety standards that has shaped it today. Certainly Bernie Ecclestone deserves credit for becoming F1’s promoter, uniting the teams to sell their commercial rights and creating the multibillion dollar behemoth with a global audience of 471 million in 2019. Yet he too, alongside the FIA, was instrumental in improving safety in racing that has stood as the gold standard in motorsport across the world, completing the work begun by three-times champion Jackie Stewart.It is inescapable that, alongside the bravery and the brilliance, one of the overriding characteristics of F1 for much of its existence was that death hung over it like a spectre. Driver safety had not been factored into the technological arms race it had become in the 1960s. Clark’s death in an F2 meeting at Hockenheim in 1968 shocked racing. Clark, after all, had been one of the greatest of them all.Circuits had not evolved with the higher speeds, trees and indeed houses still lined some and accidents often ended in fiery death. In 2019 Stewart told the  that his wife Helen had counted 57 of his contemporaries who were killed during his nine-year F1 career.Stewart led the campaign for change that began transforming the sport. From the introduction of fireproof overalls and drivers being belted into cars, to the adoption of runoff areas, to modern barriers replacing those hay bales and ultimately to the acceptance that the configuration of many tracks were simply too dangerous. The Nordschleife circuit at the Nurburgring, scene of one of Stewart’s greatest races in 1968, last hosted a grand prix the year Lauda was so nearly killed.The change was long, slow and notably did not have universal support but it did happen. Ecclestone introduced a permanent race doctor and made medical centres, ambulances and meac helicopters mandatory. Since Senna, with every avenue pursued, no drivers were killed on track until Jules Bianchi died after his accident at Suzuka in 2014. From the dark days this is perhaps the greatest legacy of these 70 years.The grid on Sunday will be a far cry from how it looked in 1950, of course. The amateurs are gone, the garagistas of the 60s and 70s a distant echo of the slick corporate teams that now compete. Yet when the lights go out the fundamental proposition remains just as it was: man and machine in a fight to the flag."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dfa90a876cfdadc99a15c391f38e54b669324e6/372_235_4314_2589/master/4314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2da1a1baeb897cb6abf6c793b7ef0cc","title":"england v pakistan first test day four live","story":"14th over: England 34-1 (Sibley 17, Root 6) Yasir Shah on for a first roll. Three singles from the over, and Root misses a cut and nearly feathers it behind. “A send off. At long last some spikiness,” writes Digvijay Yadav of the Burns dismissal. “Think Root gave one to Asad Shafiq after he was run out.” 13th over: England 31-1 (Sibley 15, Root 5) Pace from Naseem! Getting up into the high 80s as he warms up, zooms a ball past Root’s bat. Contrary to his last over the ball is flying through to Rizwan. Root mistimes a back-foot push, clunking it into the ground off the bottom edge. Gets a flick away for a boundary though, too straight again. Here’s an OBO hello to Kamal Mann. “Like you, I am based in Melbourne too (Brunswick). Following your OBO report. Keep up the great work. It’s going to be a thrilling finish.” I love Brunswick, not there right now but it has been home for a lot of my life. The top of Sydney Road, before the slope down to Blyth Street – top of the world. 12th over: England 27-1 (Sibley 15, Root 1) A quick start as young Giuseppe Root ticks his first ball wide of mid-on for a run. Abbas bowls too straight to Sibley who immediately flicks him for four! That’s great batting, he’s been tied down all day but as soon as the chance came at a boundary ball, he took it. “OBO is clearly following the England policy of rotation, which keeps life fresh and interesting. But, having had a brief exchange with Daniel on Thursday about the greatest Bob, I have been polishing my piece about Bob Dylan and cricket, and now Daniel’s buggered off! When will he return?”I can’t tell you that, Richard Hirst. All I know is that Tim DL is the Charles to my Elizabeth today, waiting for his time at last. It was a matter of time! Abbas has been relentless today, constantly nagging away. Wobble seam again from around the wicket, seaming in. It hit him above the pad, but on the back leg which is angled down the way that Burns steps forwards. In front of middle, and the DRS review shows it as umpire’s call at the top of middle stump. Abbas gets the first incision!11th over: England 22-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 11) Naseem Shah arrives, the young quick, and there are tricks in this pitch! One ball almost crawls through the Rizwan. The next takes a big chunk of dirt out of the surface, pops up high, then drops as it nears the keeper. Very erratic. Worrisome for England. A maiden.10th over: England 22-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 11) The only problem with scoring those three runs is that Sibley is back on strike to Abbas, who immediately gets his outside edge just wide of Shadab at gully. Four runs. Three slips. They’ve got an extremely short, straight mid-off now. Not near the non-striker, as is usual, but halfway down the pitch and just to the side of it. Right in his eyeline. Sibley crabs across to squeeze a run to square leg. Goes past Burns in the run chase, the race of the tortoise and the tortoise.They need 255 more to win. “Morning. I see Young Jonny Bairstow is now no longer batting for Yorkshire. Well done, Notts!” Haha, oh dear. Thanks to Young Johnny Starbuck. 9th over: England 17-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 6) Shaheen continues, though Naseem is warming up. How many Shahs have we got on this ship? They’re like Australia’s Mitchells or India’s Sharmas. Sibley gets forward to drive the last of the over for three, through cover. Positive shot. “Can Tilo Fobes (2nd over) enlighten us about cricket in Germany? A few years ago, cycling along the banks of the Elbe through the outskirts of Dresden, I was delighted (no, more than that – astonished and equally delighted) to spot a group of Pakistanis (I think) padding up for some serious-looking practice. I’d never been in Dresden before so was caught between wanting to stop, watch and find out more, and hitting the city. I’m afraid the city won, and my appreciation of cricket in Germany remains tantalisingly uninformed. I think it was a Saturday, definitely August, and was beautifully sunny. Just what Saturdays are for!”8th over: England 14-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 3) Abbas remarks his run and comes around the wicket for his first shot at the left-hander. What’s that? There’s even a little smile on his face as he runs in! He’s keen for this. The whole Pakistani cordon goes up in chatter and praise as he lands on one a postage stamp outside Burns’ off stump. A judicious leave, this time. A block the next. Abbas working him across the crease with a third, pulling the batsman wide. Another maiden. “There’s a steely-eyed determination beneath the rim of Burns’ helmet today, somewhat reminiscent of Lee Van Cleef in those spaghetti westerns. He knows that Clint Eastwood is the star. He knows he’s going to get his comeuppance at some stage. But in the meantime he’s going to do as much damage as he possibly can.”Dean Kinsella has clearly eaten some psychedelic mould that grew on his bread. 7th over: England 14-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 3) Shaheen against Sibley for the first time today, working him both sides of the wicket, harder for the left-armer to get a line against the right-hander sometimes. No run from the over. “Can I just say as someone over the age of 40 how dispiriting it was to hear that 38 year old Jimmy’s misfields we’re down to age.” I feel you, Nick. 6th over: England 14-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 3) Mohammad Abbas! He allows himself a groan of frustration finally, like someone opening the ice-cream tub at 3am only to find it empty. He angles in at Sibley and seams away, the ball sailing over the off bail, then the next goes past the edge by a fraction. This is some spell on a surface beginning to look like a digestive biscuit (sans chocolate). A bit too straight from the last ball and Sibley is able to glance a run, changing up the combinations as to who will face who. “Morning Geoff,” blasts David Horn from the battlements. “I see that YJB is at the crease already for Yorkshire today. What price a century \u0026amp a recall vs. an awkward 25 from Buttler? Although I don’t know how playing for Yorkshire affects his biosecure availability.”5th over: England 13-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 2) Shaheen is mixing up his delivery point, coming wider on the crease sometimes to angle in at Burns. Still getting swing. Another couple of runs as Shan Masood misfields at backward point, Burns getting his runs consistently just by reaching for the ball. He prods a bump ball next on the bounce into the cordon. Some puffs of dust coming up already as the ball lands. Maybe Yasir Shah should be bowling into that already. There has been serious turn on offer.“I loved Nassem’s gloriously wild agricultural yahoo when he got bowled,” writes in Tom van der Gucht. “It’s the kind of shot I regularly used to play as a lad, inspired by Botham but achieving similar results to what we just saw now, but the sort of shot we rarely see in Test cricket these days where even tail enders are coached a decent defensive technique.”It was fun this morning. My prediction that they would be out quickly was pretty accurate, it just happened to come after 32 runs. 4th over: England 11-0 (Burns 8, Sibley 2) Can’t look away from this. I mean, I’d get fired if I did, but I’d be doing this voluntarily. Sibley collects a couple of runs from Abbas touched to midwicket, but Abbas comes back with a couple of pearlers. Into the pads with just a bit of willow saving Sibley from an appeal, no idea where that was. Then the next goes the other way and zips past his edge. Abbas with that perfect length, wobble seam, going either way. What a bowler he is. 3rd over: England 9-0 (Burns 8, Sibley 0) More swing and bounce for Shaheen, this is exciting already. The gap at cover has been plugged already, only two slips. Not sure what to think about that one. Burns picks the smaller gap between cover and point for another two runs, just pushing the ball. Third umpire picks up a no-ball. Good carry from Shaheen from the replacement delivery, Rizwan taking that gloves-up from a length. Shaheen aims for the pads but he’s a bit short and it doesn’t come back, so Burns can glance a boundary fine. He’s got a habit of scrapping runs when he needs to. A message to Kim Thonger from Arabella Lyons: “Not the same thing I know but Kim can watch the match on live stream - available when play begins either club’s website!”2nd over: England 2-0 (Burns 2, Sibley 0) Abbas versus Sibley, the pairing who in the first innings gave us one of the funniest DRS reviews ever taken. Smashed in front of off stump, hitting halfway up middle, to a player caught on the crease. “What do you think, Joe, should I send that one up?” He survives unscathed for this over as Abbas works tightly on the off stump for the whole set. Tilo Fobes writes in, one of the foremost German cricket fans in the world (yes, there are some). “Regarding the highest chased totals, I get that it can be meaningless from a statistician’s perspective. But, the other reached totals do not take in account the totals scored in the first three innings of those matches. What matters is that so far one team managed to score over 250 on this current pitch. So saying that there are 4th innings in which 300 was reached at OT are just as meaningless if the average innings score of those matches was higher than this. Anyway, nicely poised test, especially as I prefer a batting collapse over a bowling collapse as they are just funnier.”I wonder who he’s supporting today?1st over: England 2-0 (Burns 2, Sibley 0) We’re ready to go. And it is sah-wing, bowler bowler bowler. Rory Burns doesn’t move the blade to a wide one but Shaheen Shah Afridi gets serious curl away from him. Left-armer versus left-hander, Burns still getting his front foot way across outside off stump in the way that brought him undone in the first innings. Had a similar one against the Windies too, a couple of ankle-taps in front of middle stump. He reaches for the second ball to block it, blocks the third on his stumps. Three slips, gully. Cover is open with a point and a mid-off. He picks that gap to punch two runs. Shaheen won’t mind given how far the batsman had to stretch for it. More swing from Shaheen as the ball straightens down the line of off stump and Burns is behind it.Speaking of small sample sizes earlier, Tim de Lisle has slipped a note under my quarantine door to point out that England only ever chased once before at Old Trafford against Pakistan. Tresco made a ton, Atherton made 51, but no one else outscored Darren Gough’s 23. They made 261 chasing 370, with Wasim, Waqar, Saqlain, and Abdul Razzak sharing the wickets. Pretty handy attack for Pakistan today, too...Three wickets to Broad, aptly matching figs of 2 for 11 for Stokes and Woakes. Archer and Bess one apiece, none for Jimmy who had a catch dropped yesterday. A couple of interesting points emailed by David Murray. “While it’s a bit difficult to complain too much about Root’s captaincy yesterday because several of his decisions seemed to come off, his underuse of Woakes remains bizarre. If Broad had come into the attack the way Woakes did yesterday, taking two wickets and looking the best bowler on the day, he would probably have been allowed to finish the opposition off, or at least brought back instead of a supposedly unfit Stokes.”There was a lot of this during the Ashes last year as well.David also mentions “the rampant ageist criticism of Anderson by several pundits. Just give the new ball to the best bowlers, why bring his age into it? There were several misfields on a hot day but, with dubious logic, his apparently can be put down to age. One mediocre day and suddenly he’s a has-been again.” We’re often not very inventive with our coverage on sport, are we? The youngster, the speedster, the veteran. The underdog, the redemption tale. Hitting back at the critics. Blah, blah. You’ll never guess how old Naseem Shah is? No one mentions it. 46.4 overs: Pakistan 169 all out (Abbas 3 not out) Mohammad Abbas wants to join the party to start this final over. He has a heave so huge at Archer that he almost literally swings himself off his feet. The ball skews over cover for two runs. A much neater shot off the pads gets a single, and that’s smart running, just dropped to midwicket where there was a man stationed but the two Pakistani bowlers were both off and running immediately. A bouncer to Naseem, which he hooks and misses but gets shoulder on it for four leg byes. Archer cleans him up with the next ball.That’s 32 runs added this morning for Pakistan, they would absolutely have accepted that for an offer. England must chase 277 to win.Straight and full, Naseem tries to launch again and gets nowhere near it. Timber.46th over: Pakistan 162-9 (Abbas 0, Naseem 4) One ball to come in the over, nine wickets down, Broad with 500 and however many wickets, and Naseem first ball just shuffles to leg side a bit and smacks a near yorker straight back over Broad’s head for four! The lead is 270!More like Yes Sir, Shah, for the first few balls of this over. He’s absolutely smoked the first. Stuart Broad’s first ball for the day, headband tied and length a bit short, and Yasir rocks back and pounds it through wide long-on for four. He tries a similar shot over the off side but only lobs it in front of mid-off. A straighter line for the third ball, so he dumps it over square leg for six! What is this! He had ten Beroccas this morning, it’s going to be an interesting day for him later but right now he’s bursting with B2 vitamins. He opens his front leg and swings clean through the line of the ball at his pads, getting huge elevation and enough distance to lose the ball in the seating bowl. Once they finally find it and return it to Broad, Yasir defends on off stump.Two balls to come. Some fielders coming up. One slip, one gully, ring field. So he aims another big drive down the ground and nicks it to Buttler. 45th over: Pakistan 148-8 (Yasir 21, Abbas 0) We’re away this morning, and Yasir Shah is away too! They’re all ready and waiting for the clock to tick over 11 o’clock. Archer has the ball but he’s rusty to start. On the pads for Yasir to work for two, then tries the bouncer and Yasir hooks for four! Top shot, got all of it through midwicket, not a top edge. Archer tries the bouncer again, and Yasir uppercuts for four! Up periscope, the Adam Gilchrist style over-the-head waft, soaring over the keeper. Gets a ball into his ribcage and dinks the pull shot for a run.Mohammad Abbas has two balls to survive. Plays it nicely! Attempted yorker, full face of the bat off his pads, but straight to square leg. These two must have been in the nets this morning, as Abbas blocks the last ball on off stump. Wonderful first over for Pakistan, 11 runs from it. Some first thoughts in response to Andy: there’s a tendency for people to assume a particular point is being made when stats are mentioned, when that may not be the case. If I get online and post that Virat Kohli’s ODI average against the Netherlands is 12, and JP Duminy’s is 190, I can almost guarantee I’ll get some angry patriots demanding to know how I can justify saying that Duminy is better than Kohli. Where all I would actually be doing is offering some information, whether because it’s funny or interesting or anything else. Talking about the chases is a bit like that. No one is saying that it’s impossible to chase 300 because the biggest chase is 294. All they’re saying is that it hasn’t happened before, which seems pretty relevant and interesting. If we get into the likelihood of it happening, I’d say that it’s psychologically much easier for a team to make 250 while chasing 400 than to make 250 chasing 250. It’s a pressure-off kind of situation because they’re not expected to get close, and the fielding side can afford to wait them out. There’s also this point from Geoff Wignall (rally the Geoffs): “A fourth innings score above 250 in a high scoring game (likely the case when the score was insufficient for victory) is altogether different to one in a low scoring game, where it’s demonstrably rare. So the point of very few successful attempts on 250+ targets is quite valid.”Alriiiight, here’s some spicy stuff from Andy Cooke. I like this.“Once again, we’ve been seeing all the ‘only once has any team chased more than this amount to win at Old Trafford’ stuff. A quick check reveals that the fourth innings of Tests at Old Trafford has seen 10 scores of over 250 (out of 46 occasions). Yes, only one of those resulted in a win - but if the target had been 250, all of them would, wouldn’t they? “There have been six posted scores of over 300 (and the seventh, at 2944, makes you think the chasing team would have been favourite if the target had been 300, really...). The key variables are simply runs scored and time - not whether or not any given attempt ended in a win against the target set then. It’s the target set now that’s important. Of course, if enough people misuse stats, they can cause a psychological barrier in the chasing team, though.”If I had to back a trifecta as to who would be the first three OBO correspondents of the morning, it would have read Brian Withington, Kim Thonger, Abhijato Sensarma. That was absolutely correct.The former is of a mind with me: “I see you shared my amazement at the collective RootSibley DRS mind hive in first innings - a review that would have made Kevin Pietersen blush - let’s hope they are not required to repeat the exercise second time round.”The middle has a question, to which I’m pretty sure the answer is that no spectators are allowed anywhere, but if you know differently then let me know. “My beloved Somerset are playing at the county ground in Northampton today and living as I do about 30 minutes away these days I’m tempted to pop over to watch them trounce the home side but I can’t see from NCCC website whether they are allowing spectators. My younger son’s back garden overlooks the ground but even he can’t tell because the stands he can see look empty.”The latter is keen to see whether Pakistan “manage to snatch victory from the jaws of defeatdefeat from the jaws of victory today (delete as appropriate).”For anyone feeling irritable while the world is falling apart, Mr Engel is having an award-worthy grump today about a whole range of things. You might sympathise. If you’re trying to gauge what Yasir and company can add this morning, I’m going to suggest not many. You can point to the fact that the leggie has a Test century, just as he certainly would do. As someone who was there to watch it at Adelaide, it did come via an awful lot of missed chances, a lot of chancy airborne clouts, and the fact that England’s favourite D. Warner had made a triple century and the Aussies knew they would win eventually. Mo Abbas can bat a little bit, 13 not outs to 14 dismissals in his career, and four times he’s got into double figures. So, some chance he could hang around for a little while if Yasir can score. I’ve just got that feeling, though, that England’s opening bowlers will be used, and will zero in on off stump, and find something, and nick these last two out pretty quickly. Naseem Shah coming in last has not done much batting, and there’s a reason for that, namely his ability. Lots of moves from the ICC and the various member boards over the last few months, shifting tours and tournaments here, there, and everywhere. This one makes the least sense of all, postponing the Women’s World Cup that was due next February on the grounds that the players won’t have had enough games for preparation, and it’ll be too hard to play the qualifiers to get the three undecided places filled.Which is, frankly, nonsense if the same boards can get the IPL and the current English summer up and running. The tournament is in New Zealand, where they don’t even need biosecure grounds as long as teams can quarantine on the way in. Roll the quallies in straight before the tournament if you have to, come on. And every team will be coming off the same base. They haven’t forgotten how to play cricket, but they might if you keep cancelling everything in sight.Good morning England, good other times to others. Geoff Lemon here, enjoying a brief dalliance on the OBO for this series. To celebrate putting the last words on my book manuscript today I’ve agreed to write more reams about cricket into the night, as it will be from my current location in Melbourne lockdown. Send me tidings of good cheer if you will, the winter marches on cold and deep!What a Test match we’ve had so far. It has kept me company through the last few writing nights, much as the West Indies series did before that – an absolute joy to have the sounds of cricket, or some of them at least, coming sotto voce through the speakers on the other side of the room. No crowd noise, of course, but that could as easily happen at Dubai Sport City or a midweek county fixture. What we have had is the pock of bat on ball, the scuff of the spikes, the animation of the players themselves.Pakistan’s bowlers! Goodness me, they were a sight to watch through that first innings. Swing, seam, pace, turn, all you could ask. The Pope and Buttler rearguard was fascinating, then the later Pakistan push. Shan Masood was special at the start, Broad and Woakes special in both innings. Anderson and Bess have had chances missed. England are a batsman light because Stokes couldn’t bowl, but he came on and bowled anyway when they really needed a wicket, and he gave them two.We’ll start today with Pakistan 244 in front, two wickets left in hand, and England desperate to make sure they don’t add any more runs to that lead. It would already be the second-biggest chase at Old Trafford, the biggest was 294. I don’t think Mohammad Abbas and Naseem Shah will help Yasir Shah get that far.You can email me as ever, geoff.lemon@the, or tweet me on the electric choir using @GeoffLemonSport.

Sheridan will face off against Democrat Paul Penzone in the November elections.This is Arpaio’s second failed attempt to return to politics since Trump pardoned him in 2017, months after he was convicted of criminal contempt of court for violating a judge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos. In 2018, he finished last in a three-way race for a Senate nomination in Arizona. This latest defeat likely signals an end to the 88-year-old’s political career.But Sheridan, a 38-year veteran of the sheriff’s office, has promised to carry on Arpaio’s legacy of harsh, anti-immigrant policing. Arpaio’s legacy also lives on in Trump. “Sheriff Joe” was a precursor to Trump, said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican consultant in Arizona, in a recent interview with the . Arpaio, who called himself “America’s toughest sheriff”, became infamous for his reality star showmanship and anti-immigration crackdowns long before Trump. “He birthed that nationalism narrative that Trump is now using,” Coughlin said.As the sheriff of Phoenix from 1992 through 2016, Arpaio created the “Tent City” jail that he compared to a concentration camp, where inmates were forced to work in chain gangs in Arizona’s 120F heat. His department racked up $147m in taxpayer-funded legal bills, and botched the investigations of more than 400 sex-crimes complaints.But he’s most well-known nationally for his anti-immigration tactics. Embracing a national program that allowed his officers to act as immigration agents, he invited camera crews along on raids. A federal judge in 2013 found that his department racially profiled Latinos, and his traffic patrols targeted immigrants.Voters eventually tired of his hardline tactics and voted him out in 2016. His campaign this year vastly outspent Sheridan’s, but to no avail. Though Sheridan has vowed to carry on some of Arpaio’s signature policies if elected, he has indicated he’ll do so without bombast and theatrics. Sheridan, like Arpaio, was found guilty of civil contempt of court for disobeying an order to stop racial profiling but was not charged criminal contempt.Penzone, who unseated Arpaio in 2016, is still regarded as the favored candidate in November. Political strategists believe that Arpaio’s fall from power in Arizona could foretell Trump’s fate in November.Arpaio’s nationalism, as well as Arizona’s infamous “show me your papers” law, which gave law enforcement sweeping powers to target Latinos, galvanized a generation of progressive activists – many of whom have been elected to serve into local and state office. “The state is becoming more erse, and it’s becoming more Latino – and it’s becoming younger,” said Marisa Franco, the co-founder of the social justice advocacy group Mijente, in an interview with the . “It awakened an electorate that’s, I think, more justice-minded.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86ff5b4e0ff38685c524b65eebd358e55b6ea45c/0_261_4667_2801/master/4667.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c5ce53e68c2f0bba1f5edfc25e3f452d","title":"progressive democrats primaries victories cori bush","story":"Wins mark a dramatic shift from the spate of losses the progressive wing suffered over the last yearProgressive Democrats are enjoying a wave of victories in federal primaries across the country with some especially notable triumphs for Black activist candidates.Those successes, candidates and strategists say, are due to a mixture of broad energy from the Black Lives Matter movement, failure of conventional policy remedies to meet the moment and a rock-solid infrastructure of progressive organizations.The latest victory came in Missouri on the same night the state voted to expand Medicaid – a longtime liberal goal. Cori Bush, a liberal activist and registered nurse, defeated the 10-term congressman William Lacy Clay in the Democratic primary.A few days later Marquita Bradshaw, an environmental justice activist, became the first Black woman to win the Democratic party’s nomination in Tennessee. In the process of Bradshaw’s surprise victory she defeated James Mackler, the preferred candidate of Senate Democrats’ national campaign arm.Both candidates ran on positions familiar to the progressive community: racial justice, Medicare for All and environmental justice. The victories by the candidates, both Black women, are the latest in a strong of upsets liberals have enjoyed this year.“People are ready to see Black women lead,” Bush said in an interview on Friday. “Ready for there to be parity, for more women to be going into Congress.”In New York, the progressive favorite Jamaal Bowman ousted 16-term congressman Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House foreign affairs committee. The Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a member of the informal group of progressive firebrands known as “the Squad”, also survived a contentious primary fight with another local Democrat.All together the victories mark a dramatic shift from the spate of losses the progressive wing of the Democratic party has suffered over the last year, including the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders’ crushing defeat in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary after a brief period of being the frontrunner.The victories are also much-needed comfort for the progressive wing, which will probably have complaints with whoever former vice-president Joe Biden picks as his running mate.Bush said her victory was driven by an enhanced interest in candidates with progressive policy prescriptions in a time of economic crisis, an ongoing pandemic, and global healthcare concerns.“Covid-19 hit us and hit us hard and we were ill-prepared for it,” Bush said. “People were able to see, with me for instance, I’ve been preaching Medicare for All since 2016. People didn’t understand it back then but when Covid-19 hit people started to see it.”The implications of these victories was summed up in the subject line of a Bowman campaign fundraising email: “The Squad keeps getting bigger.”“That’s exactly what we’ll see on Capitol Hill,” Bush said. “We want to go in and make the Squad even bigger. The Squad that’s in Congress, that are members, as well as the Squad that are not members … We’re all like-minded to see our communities change and wanting to do it now.”Bush offered a warning to other incumbent Democrats.“If there are areas where we have people who are just not producing for their communities and their communities are crying out for help and they’re not getting it, which was what was happening here in our community, then hopefully someone will step up to run,” Bush said, adding she would probably be happy to help them.Maya Rupert, the former campaign manager for Democrat Julián Castro’s presidential campaign, predicted a wave of progressives would come into Congress through this election cycle.“I think there are going to be a lot more people that are coming in governing in a way that is undeniably and unapologetically progressive,” Rupert said. Victories haven’t come so easily for progressive Democrats in the past few years. But that’s changed because of the major crises of the moment as the country is roiled by a long-overdue reckoning on racism, triggered by protests against police mistreatment of Black Americans.“I think the environment is being largely driven by conversations on race. And I think increasingly that is through the lens of economics as well,” the veteran Democratic strategist Brandon Davis said. “It’s broadly defined. I think increasingly that is through the lends of economics as well. It’s broadly defined to the extent these candidates are leaning into these issues, they’re finding more traction.”The lead-up to 2020 has been marked by a wave of outside groups boosting progressive candidates. Some of those groups enhanced their infrastructure while others emerged with very specific missions.Marie Newman, a liberal favorite who ousted a longtime conservative Democratic congressman in Illinois’s third district congressional primary earlier this year, said “there has been a dramatic level of lifting up of these groups on every level. Organizing. Grassroots. People in every neighborhood working hard and awakening.”A group called Fight Corporate Monopolies has taken aim at the Massachusetts congressman Richard Neal, the chairman of the powerful ways and means committee, over Neal receiving support from the Blackstone Group, a private investment management company. The group also backed Bush in Missouri. Other more general organizations like the Justice Democrats helped propel Bowman to victory.Progressives argue that these victories and any more to come this cycle are showing the broader Democratic party that their positions are effective in campaigns.“One of the biggest final remaining humps for the progressive agenda is to demonstrate to the rest of the Democratic party that our approach is good for general election politics,” said Faiz Shakir, who is a consultant with Fight Corporate Monopolies and served as Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign manager.Monica Klein, a Democratic strategist known for her work advising liberal candidates, said the coronavirus pandemic as well as the resulting economic downturn has pushed more voters to consider candidates with progressive policy positions.”I think from a nationwide public health crisis that has been mishandled from both Republicans and establishment Democrats to the growing Black Lives Matter protests, more and more Americans are getting frustrated with the status quo, whether that is Republicans in Washington or establishment Democrats who are not providing bold enough solutions to the crises that we’re facing,” Klein said.There are still more contests to come though which dangle the prospect of further wins.In Massachusetts, political newcomer Ihssane Leckey is running in a crowded race to replace Congressman Joe Kennedy. Leckey, a former Wall Street regulator who immigrated to the US from Morocco at 20 and identifies as a democratic socialist, is running to help “change the face of Congress”.“These victories are a sign of hope in our country, that the people still have the power to change the course of our nation, away from fascism and into an inclusive democracy.”She said the common thread between the string of recent progressive victories is that the candidates share the “lived experiences of the most vulnerable constituents in their districts”.Leckey, the lone woman of color in the race who struggled through periods of poverty before becoming the first in her family to graduate from college, is running on a “justice agenda” which supports Medicare for All, a Green New Deal and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. She said the coronavirus pandemic had exposed the need for sweeping economic and social reform, and had helped change the minds of some voters in her district who may have supported these policies but did not understand their urgency. “These are the issues of our time,” she said. “People were feeling the sting, even when they had a little more comfort before the pandemic. Now we’re here to ensure relief for everyone, and especially the most vulnerable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fabdf9932a25b67c2213d456132d42f9f7745ab5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39a07d8a0608f4fa04e7315395d6fd4e","title":"beirut explosion before and after satellite images","story":"Satellite images show the scale of the damage caused by Tuesday’s explosions in the Lebanese capital, with buildings miles from the port lying in ruin.

His state is one of 21 across the US that have been placed by the White House coronavirus taskforce in the “red zone”, indicating the disease is now so prevalent that immediate restrictions must be imposed to avoid dire consequences.Kemp, a Republican governor and Donald Trump ally, has adopted a controversial approach to Covid-19. Since early July the virus has roared across his state, with new infections rising sharply to top a devastating tally of 182,000.Deaths too have ticked dramatically upwards, with new daily peaks pushing the toll close to 4,000. Yet Kemp continues to expend much of his political energy fighting local officials rather than the microbe.For weeks he has been suing the Democratic mayor of the largest city, Atlanta, to stop her mandating masks. Keisha Lance Bottoms, who is African American, as is more than half of her city, has decried the move by Kemp, who is white, as an act of “personal retaliation”.Videos are circulating of unmasked nightclubbers grinding in close proximity in packed dance floors. Yet Kemp continues to allow clubs, bars and indoor restaurants to carry on with abandon.Social media images show high school corridors crammed with non-mask-wearing pupils on the first day of the new school year. Yet Kemp persists on passing the buck on whether to open classrooms to inidual school districts. In Atlanta alone, 260 staff tested positive for the virus, or exposure to it, even before classes began.It is against this backdrop that the letter dropped on Kemp’s desk. Signed by almost 2,400 doctors, nurses, physical therapists and other public health workers at the coalface of the pandemic response, it paints a devastating picture of mortally ill people stretching hospitals to breaking point right across the state under Kemp’s watch.The letter pleads with Kemp to change tack, calling on him to enforce a temporary mask order, close bars and nightclubs and heavily restrict indoor dining and gatherings at places of worship. The signatories entreat him to rapidly expand testing to counter huge lines and speed up test results which can take two weeks.“Our situation is rapidly getting out of control,” Melanie Thompson, an Atlanta physician and co-organizer of the letter, told the . “Frontline health workers are at the end of their ropes – we have been left on our own to make it up as we go along, while the governor fails to do what’s needed to control this epidemic.”But Georgia is far from unique.As the virus spreads, the many discrete problems that it has exposed in earlier stages of the pandemic are now congealing into one epic challenge. Georgia’s plight is not a matter of any one of those factors. It is a product of all of them.The virus has extended its invisible tentacles out of the urban centers such as Atlanta and the second-largest city Augusta, through the suburbs and into rural areas where health services that were inadequate before the pandemic are now on their knees.“This was foreseen,” said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “Back in the spring, colleagues and I predicted that this virus was so insidious it would move into rural areas where it would be particularly pernicious and difficult to control.”Like many of her fellow experts in pandemic response, Rivers has watched with growing dismay as the Trump administration and its governor outriders have missed multiple opportunities to contain the virus. “Humanity has gone to great lengths in the past to defeat infectious diseases – the eradication of smallpox for one,” she said. “I haven’t seen the same energy around this pandemic.”As time passes, and the nationwide death toll mounts, Rivers observes that the landmarks are spaced ever wider apart. The country commemorated the first death, followed by the first 100 deaths, then 1,000, then 100,000, almost without noticing that the currency of death was being devalued along the way.The same applies to the total number of confirmed infections in the US, now approaching 5m – more than a quarter of all recorded cases in the world. When Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, said in March there would be “millions of cases” before the pandemic was done, America’s collective jaw dropped but when the news broke recently that there were almost 2m new US cases in July alone, the nation barely blinked.“I hear complacency and people accepting that this is how things are going to be,” Rivers said. “But it is never too late to take a different tack and steer the ship to somewhere better. We can do that now, we should do it now.”Complacency sums up Trump’s helmsmanship as he sails directly into the eye of the storm. From the day that the first Covid case was recorded in the US on 20 January, the president has been slow to respond to the threat, has put his re-election hopes and reopening the economy ahead of public safety, and has repeatedly ignored scientific warnings in favor of his own fatally flawed instincts.With the death toll at almost 160,000, Trump has sought refuge in the acceptance that Rivers identified. That tendency was on vivid display this week in the widely parsed Axios interview, in which it was put to Trump that 1,000 Americans were dying every day.“They are dying. That’s true,” Trump replied. “It is what it is. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t doing everything we can. It’s under control as much as you can control it.”Abraar Karan, a global health physician at Brigham \u0026amp Women’s hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, scoffs at the idea that the US has done all it could. “The US, relative to the resources we have, has had the worst response to the pandemic in the world,” he said. What riles Karan most is that political leaders have had the benefit of watching others go through the crisis, yet have stubbornly refused to learn the lessons. “China, South Korea, Japan and Italy – they were all hit before we were and we didn’t listen. Then the north-east was hit on our own soil and we didn’t pay attention. Now numbers are soaring in Texas, Arizona, Florida, and people still aren’t listening,” he said.With the US registering about 55,000 new cases a day, the country looks destined to be punished by further repetitions for the foreseeable future. Epidemiologists at the University of Washington in Seattle suggest that under current projections as many as 230,000 Americans will have lost their lives by presidential election day on 3 November.By the end of this year the US could be well on its way towards 300,000 deaths.“This has gone beyond a danger to the health of Americans, it is now a full-blown homeland security crisis,” said Peter Hotez, a global health scientist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “Average Americans are so insecure they no longer feel safe to leave their homes.”Hopes that political leaders will change tack have faded for Hotez to such an extent that in the absence of federal guidance he has produced his own guidelines for how to contain the virus. He calls them his “October plan”, and notes that other academic centers of excellence have also started producing similar plans in a desperate attempt to fill the void. They include Caitlin Rivers and her colleagues at Johns Hopkins who have published a document titled Resetting Our Response: Changes Needed in the US.Hotez worries too that people are being lured into false confidence by hopes for a vaccine, which he predicts will only arrive in the middle of 2021 at the earliest. He is similarly skeptical about the idea that were Joe Biden to win the presidential election in November things would change quickly, given that Biden would only enter the White House on 20 January.It all points towards a period of drawn-out agony for America. Asked how the country will cope amid this seemingly never-ending tragedy, Hotez channels Winston Churchill.“When you are going through hell, keep going,” he said. Then he added: “We have no other choice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c166e40a1d731f28d6ec3bb68ef2df08157dfe53/0_64_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d4bb5ba3491796c496f2415bec1ff26","title":"india prime minister narendra modi plans to fell ancient forest to create 40 new coal fields","story":"Narendra Modi’s dream of a ‘self-reliant India’ comes at a terrible price for its indigenous populationOver the past decade, Umeshwar Singh Amra has witnessed his homeland descend into a battleground. The war being waged in Hasdeo Arand, a rich and bioerse Indian forest, has pitted indigenous people, ancient trees, elephants and sloths against the might of bulldozers, trucks and hydraulic jacks, fighting with a single purpose: the extraction of coal.Yet under a new “self-reliant India” plan by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to boost the economy post-Covid-19 and reduce costly imports, 40 new coalfields in some of India’s most ecologically sensitive forests are to be opened up for commercial mining.Among them are four huge blocks of Hasdeo Arand’s 420,000 acres of forest in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, which sit above an estimated 5bn tonnes of coal.It marks a significant shift. The coal industry in India is state-owned, but this auction of 40 new coal blocks will see the creation of a privatised, commercial coal sector in India. Among those bidding for it are India’s rich and powerful industrial giants, including the $14bn (£11bn) Adani group run by the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who operates India’s largest coal power plants and has close ties to Modi.Amra, who is an Aasi, a term used to describe India’s indigenous people, was one of nine local sarpanchs  – village leaders – who recently wrote to Modi demanding a stop to the auction in Hasdeo Arand. He said: “If the government gave me the option to give up my life in exchange for no more mining happening in the forest, I would do it in a second.”Amra has seen first-hand the environmental devastation wreaked by open-cast coal mines. In 2011, two vast open-cast mines were excavated on the forest’s peripheries, ripping up the fragile land and filling the surroundings with pollution, smoke, heat, noise and poison. Crime rose drastically in the area and the elephants that lived in the forest, disoriented by the new hostile conditions, became aggressive, leading to dozens of deaths.The prospect of more significant blocks of the forest, the largest in India, being handed over to private mining operations was more than Amra could bear. Five villages will be destroyed and more than 6,000 mainly indigenous people displaced, as well as thousands of hectares of trees, torn down for mines and roads.“If more mining happens everything will change the natural resources will be gone, our way of life will disappear, everything will be under threat,” he said. “We are tribal people, we cannot go out and live in the cities and no amount of money can ever compensate us. There is no forest like this in the world – cut it down and it can never be replaced.”While across the world governments have geared towards a “green recovery” post Covid-19 – the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said recently there was “no good reason for any country to include coal” in recovery plans – India is putting fossil fuel at the forefront of its strategy to turn the pandemic into economic opportunity.“Why cannot India be the world’s largest exporter of coal?” asked Modi as he announced the coal auction project.But India’s joint secretary for coal, Maddirala Nagaraju, said that all the country’s projections showed that demand for coal would increase and insisted that increased domestic coalmining was the “cheapest way of meeting the energy needs of the people”.“We are the country with the fourth largest coal reserves in the world and we need to provide energy security for over a billion people: coal is the only way,” said Nagaraju. He conceded that there would be “costly trade-offs” in opening up protected forest areas for mining, but said this had the support of local communities who “want the land to be acquired because they get high compensation packages”.He added: “Yes, some people have objected, but the mining will bring a lot of development, employment and money to these areas. How else will we develop these Aasi people in central India?”Ramesh alleged this was a direct result of pressure from the powerful corporate coal lobby, Adani in particular. The Adani group is contracted to operate two of the mines currently open in Hasdeo Arand, and has been pushing to expand mining operations in the forest for years, even reportedly offering microloans to local tribal people in order to win their support.“Adani is behind this,” claims Ramesh. “He is one of the most influential forces on the government.”“Modi poses as a great environmental champion globally but his track record is one of complete loosening of environmental laws and regulations,” Ramesh added. “The corporate lobbies are just too powerful and in the name of ease for businesses, environment has become the biggest casualty.”The Adani group rejected the allegations as baseless and politically motivated. A spokesperson said the company: “Has always strived to provide balanced and affordable energy supply to an energy-deprived population of 1.3 billion people whose per capita energy consumption is less than half the world’s average and almost one-tenth of many of the developed economies.It said it aimed to become the world’s largest renewable energy company by 2025."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b487f6298ae93d44202b825f8a670866569fed/0_126_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f518095e322503bde96d36abf69c4f3b","title":"four young artists reveal how they express their unique voice in pictures","story":"As part of  Labs’ collaboration with Levi’s and young people with something to say, Gen Z illustrators and photographers discuss what informs their work‘We need a more erse understanding of the world’“I use my art to celebrate the lips, noses, hair and skin colour of women from black and mixed-race communities who have become stigmatised and criticised by society,” says illustrator Vicki Jones. “I believe everyone is beautiful and worthy of greater acceptance.

But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance. Let young people enjoy being teenagers so we can enjoy adulthood.If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, the people featured recommend these Instagram accounts: @bodyposipanda @i_weigh @mattzhaig @crazyheadcomics @muslimgirl @the_indian_feminist @privtoprog @Ayat_Zaman"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoring"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThere is more than a touch of groundhog day about the news of serious outbreaks of Covid-19 in a number of food processing plants in the midlands.Clusters of the disease in these fertile environments for transmitting the virus were a feature of the crisis phase of our pandemic, several months ago.It seemed the problem had been dealt with, but now this. Have we learned anything?It is disquieting, too, given the mass of existing international evidence pointing to meat factories as one of the most dangerous places for the spread of the disease. Back in June, for example, more than 1,500 workers at Tönnies, Germany’s biggest pig slaughterer, tested positive.Have we not learned from the experience of other countries? Is this similar to our failure to pick up on the danger signs coming from nursing homes in other countries last February, a lack of alertness that had such a disastrous outcome?While Ireland is experiencing a surge in clusters in meat factories, the German plant has reopened after its owners installed new ventilation systems, implemented weekly testing of staff and put an end to risky employment practices such as the subcontracting of labour.Would we be experiencing these outbreaks if similar changes had been made pre-emptively across the sector here? It’s difficult to be certain, but it’s hard not to suspect that Ireland’s softly-softly approach to surveillance and enforcement is contributing to the problem.Almost six months since we started grappling with the pandemic, we know we have done some things well the lockdown stopped the virus in its tracks and the health service geared up effectively to deal with the surge in cases.We didn’t manage to protect the vulnerable and so possibly hundreds of older people in nursing home died unnecessarily, and horribly. We weren’t alone there in international terms, but that’s hardly a comfort to grieving families.Being just outside the top 10 globally for Covid-19 deaths relative to population is nothing to boast about, but at least we eventually got a firm grip of the pandemic and new cases fell to a trickle for several months.That has given us time to catch our breath, to work out what works in fighting the virus and to prepare for what is to come as society opens up and winter approaches.That cases are rising again is no surprise to public health officials, who are better informed and better armed to deal with this threat than they were six months ago.It may be simpler in infection control terms to impose blanket restrictions but it is economically ruinous. No amount of money-printing and subventions can hide the zombification of much of the economy. A new approach is needed.Pass the chiselIt may be that public health officials don’t trust people to continue to comply as much as they have up to now. Or it may be because they don’t have the teeth to enforce specific rules. Either way, we’re relying too heavily on the sledgehammer when the chisel is needed.Throughout the summer, circular arguments about travel restrictions and green lists have dominated debate, while the elephants in the room, the Common Travel Area with the UK and the ease with which travellers can come from the US, have been ignored.The US and the UK are two of our closest partners and they have both had a terrible pandemic. Their potential contribution to the importation of cases is greater than most other countries. Yet citizens of both countries are free to wander into the Republic, without even having to self-isolate if they cross from Northern Ireland.Ironically, travel has played no major role in the resurgence of Covid-19, with home-grown cases mostly responsible.Testing and contact tracing are the key weapons in tackling fresh surges of the virus. We don’t know whether our current 15,000-a-day capacity is sufficient because by the time it was built up, the number of new cases had fallen away.It’s now said to be a next-day service for the delivery of results after the test is carried out, but there are still anecdotal reports of longer waits.The average time to complete all calls when tracing contacts of a case is 1.2 days. Yet up to a quarter of contacts fail to show for a free test on “day zero” and up to half don’t show for a further test seven days later. The words “leaky sieve” come to mind.Pooled samplesA new approach to testing might see more pooled testing, where samples from an entire neighbourhood, or factory, or school, are collected. If the pooled sample is clear, good if it isn’t, the virus is present and inidual testing is required.Many rapid tests have been developed and could have a role, in spite of doubts about their reliability. Anyone testing positive on a one-hour test, for example, could be sent forward for the more comprehensive PCR test, while self-isolating.Despite the precariousness of the current situation, there is no going back to the full lockdown of last March. We know now what works to stop the virus: distance, hand hygiene, masks. We know where the risky environments are: crowded indoor spaces, meat plants, shared accommodation.We need now to continue to protect the vulnerable, and to develop targeted strategies that “build a wall” around the current outbreaks.However, there is as yet no reason not to keep moving towards the restoration of a low-risk society where people can try to restore their economic fortunes while staying healthy.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324959.1596833463!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"midlands lockdown movement restrictions in place for residents of kildare laois and offaly","story":"An Taoiseach Micheál Martin outlines the new measures that will come into effect as a two-week local lockdown is announced for Kildare, Laois and Offaly following a spike in Covid-19 cases in the region.

Photograph: Julien Behal Residents of Kildare, Laois and Offaly face limits on their movement for at least two weeks as part of a series of new restrictions in these areas in a bid to control a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases. Taoiseach Micheál Martin also said cafes, restaurants and pubs in these three counties will close from midnight for two weeks as well as cinemas, theatres and museums. There will be no sporting events or matches and all gyms will close.People in the three affected counties will only be allowed travel within their own county, unless it is for work or medical appointments, or for family reasons. There will be an exemption for those who need to travel for farming reasons. There will be no travel into the three counties other than for work, medical reasons or other essential reasons like farming.Those who need to get to other destinations through those counties will be able to do so but will be asked not to stop while travelling through these counties.Garda checkpoints will be placed in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly to ensure people do not flout the restrictions, Garda sources said. Regulations were expected to be drawn up over the weekend by the Department of Health which would again give gardaí the power to arrest people who breach the travel restrictions and who refuse to comply when stopped at a checkpoint. Minister for Health Simon Donnelly said regulations are being put together to enforce the new restrictions. He said there would be Garda checkpoints in the three counties although he said “we will succeed by solidarity.” The regulations will apply from Sunday night onwards, he said.Extraordinary lockdownThe Department of Health on Friday reported another four deaths and 98 new cases - bringing the total number of deaths in Ireland to 1,772, and the number of confirmed cases to 26,470.Mr Martin has said the extraordinary lockdown of the three Leinster counties where there have been alarming increases in cases in the past two weeks was done to prevent any widespread return of the virus. “I want to be very clear that the Government is determined to do everything possible to prevent the return of widespread transmission of the virus” he said. Speaking from Government Buildings, Mr Martin said the “process of reopening is not simple. It is not a case of moving forward step by step”. Mr Martin said he understood the increasing impatience that many people feel. “There is a huge desire to get back to normal life.”However, he added, the coronavirus pandemic presented “a deep and urgent threat, which is merciless and unrelenting”.Mr Martin said: “While the burden of the decision falls heaviest on the three counties of Kildare, Laois and Offaly, the message needs to be understood everywhere in Ireland. There is nothing inevitable about keeping the disease under control.”Working conditions in meat factories Acting chief medical officer Ronan Glynn said on Friday evening that he was not in a position to offer guarantees that the partial restrictions would be lifted in two weeks’ time. He said the aim of acting at this point was to stop community transmission before it can take hold.“While I know the next two weeks are going to be difficult for many, we need to continue to work together.” He said he was not surprised that people are angry and disappointed and said the reality is that the virus spread quite quickly in these counties. “We felt really at this point we had to move.”He said there were significant clusters in these areas as opposed to community transmission but that it would be “too late” to contain potential community transmission if action was not taken. On the issue of meat factories and concerns about the working conditions of workers there, Dr Glynn said dedicated outbreak control teams have been put in place over recent months and that “it did appear that things had come under control”. In terms of factories, Dr Glynn said two of the factories have over 80 cases. The dog food factory in Naas has just over 50 cases. “We do know the people working in these facilities often live together, and travel to work together, and within the factories they work very closely together. Many of the environments are loud so people are shouting. There are a whole range of factors that lead to these sectors being high risk,”he said. Dáil deputies representing Kildare, Laois and Offaly from across the political spectrum have called for emergency funding for businesses impacted and have been highly critical of the delayed response of State agencies to the “obvious” risks of outbreaks in meat processing plants and direct provision centres. Restrictions Under the new measures announced this evening people living in the three counties are advised to avoid public transport, particularly those who are vulnerable. Indoor gatherings will be restricted to six people. Outdoor gatherings will be limited to around 15 people as long as strict social distancing can be maintained.While restaurants and bars will have to close except for takeaway, those who can offer seats for 15 people outside can do so as long as strict social distancing is maintained.Hotels can remain open but must limit occupancy to essential non-social and non-tourist reasons. Existing guests can remain for the duration of their booking.The Taoiseach said those who can work from home in this region should do so. Plans to reopen schools remain unchanged.Shops will remain open but shoppers must wear masks. All cinemas, theatres, casinos, betting shops, bingo halls, gyms, leisure centres, swimming pools, exercise and dance studios must close.Attendance at a funeral service and burial or cremation ceremony should be limited to 25 outdoors. Indoor events connected to the funeral are limited to a maximum of 6 people.Places of worship remain open for private prayer, while services are to be held online.Prison visits, nursing home visits and hospital visits will also be suspended under the new regional lockdown plan with the exception of the most critical and compassionate circumstances (for example end of life). More cases Meanwhile, a food processing plant in Co Kildare has announced further cases of coronavirus among its workers. O’Brien Fine Foods said it stopped operations at its Timohoe facility at 9pm on Wednesday after 80 workers tested positive for coronavirus. On Friday, the firm announced a further six cases of coronavirus have been detected, adding in a statement that the “level of asymptomatic infectivity appears to be very high”.

Photograph: Collins The Cabinet on Friday approved a series of specific restrictions for counties Kildare, Offaly and Laois in response to a sharp increase in cases of Covid-19 in these areas.Over the past 14 days 292 cases of the virus have arisen in Kildare, Laois and Offaly. These represent almost half of all cases detected in Ireland during that time.The measures, which were recommended by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), were confirmed by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.The measures are set to come into force at midnight and last for at least two weeks.Main points of the new restrictions for the midlandsTravel and transport Residents of Kildare, Offaly and Laois can only travel within their own county, other than for the following reasons:People are asked not to travel into any of these counties, other than for the reasons above, and you need to travel through these counties to get somewhere else.People are asked not stop in Kildare, Laois or Offaly during a journey unless for essential purposes.Public and private transport  Residents of these counties should not use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary. And where possible they should not share private vehicles with others from outside their household.Economic activity and work  Anyone in these counties who can work from home should work from home.Cafes and restaurants  All cafes and restaurants, including bars operating as restaurants, should only offer takeaway or delivery, or outdoor dining (maximum 15 people with strict physical distancing). Otherwise they should close.Hotels can remain open but must limit occupancy to essential non-social and non-tourist reasons. Existing guests can remain for the duration of their booking.Indoor gatherings  All indoor gatherings should be restricted to a maximum of six people from no more than three households, while maintaining physical distancing.Outdoor gatherings  Outdoor gatherings should be limited to a maximum of 15 people, while maintaining physical distancing.Cultural events and religious services  All cinemas, theatres, casinos, betting shops, bingo halls, gyms, leisure centres, swimming pools, exercise and dance studios must close at midnight.Attendance at a funeral service and burial or cremation ceremony should be limited to 25 outdoors.

Photograph: Tom O’HanlonAs rumours swirl around much of the midlands on Friday regarding Covid-19 lockdowns, Brian Cloonan takes delivery of nine pallets of Christmas decorations for his hardware shops on William Street in Tullamore.“We have to keep the lights on,” says Cloonan, whose family has run the shop for 70 years, “We have to get the balance right, to do it safely, to the best of our ability,” he says.Nearby, on Kilbride Street, Ken Grennan of Grennan’s Butchers predicts a few bleak months lie ahead for business and for the town. “One way or the other, it’s going to be hard. The Government can’t continue the supports indefinitely.”During the height of the pandemic, Grennan sold more fresh meat cuts to people who were, unusually, cooking at home all the time, but the butcher’s ready-meal business was “completely wiped out”.“I’m trying hard to find a silver lining, but the silver is pretty thin,” he says. “I can see a lot of unemployment in the months ahead. A lot of jobs are going to have to go because demand isn’t there.”In The Brewery Tap pub on O’Connor Square, Paul Bell and his wife, Cathy-Anne, nervously wait for news. “Locally, the feeling is that the biggest numbers are in Dublin and Kildare, ” says Paul. “Why shut down Offaly now and leave Dublin open?”The couple have had strict rules in place since they reopened. Besides taking temperatures and names, customers are asked to place their own mask in a provided envelope during meals so it does not contaminate the table.“I think they should go back to the 5km restriction. I’m not anti-Dubs, but last weekend Tullamore was full of Dublin people in the hotels. There’s cases all over Ireland, I think there’s other ways of containment rather than shutting us down again,” he says.A second lockdown will hit Offaly hard. “We’ve been working so hard to do things right. If there is a lockdown, I hope it will be short term. In fairness there is a great sense of community spirit in the town.”Community spiritAbdul Hafiz, proprietor and chef at Cafe India, worries that new restrictions would damage confidence at a time when “people are barely gaining their confidence about sitting in a restaurant”.“We were lucky that we remained open all through the lockdown, unlike some of our friends who did not have a takeaway trade. The transition from restaurant to takeaway was harder for them.”However, Hafiz is hopeful that the town’s community spirit will remain intact. “It’s a small town so every body knows everybody and we support each other.”On High Street, Anthony Kearns of Guy Clothing complains of an anti-rural bias. “There are serious issues in Laois, Offaly and Kildare, but no more than there was in Dublin six weeks ago. Nobody has locked down Dublin or Cork or Limerick. ”If everyone practises safe hygiene and keeps their distance, the virus can be contained, says Kearns, who owns three shops, employing 26 people: “It’s not as if it’s all over Tullamore or Edenderry or Birr, ” he says.John Ryan of Midland Books, the sole local supplier for school books, says people have got used to living with masks, social distancing and hand sanitisers. “We felt we were on top of it,” he says. “So, it would be a big blow to us now if any restrictions were to come in. We don’t feel we are high-risk, we feel we are able to keep our customers and ourselves safe.

Irish policy in the area of non-ionising radiation is informed by a substantial volume of internationally recognised scientific research and evidence.”“This is an area that is kept under review and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitor scientific, technical and other developments on these matters and advise the department accordingly.“The EPA is dedicated to providing current, factual and clear public information to alleviate unfounded fears and concern,” it also notes.The officials said that the telecommunications industry had expressed fears “that ill-informed concerns and objections may pose a risk to investment and increase the digital ide”.“The department is working to develop a communications strategy along with the EPA,” the briefing document confirms.Online shoppingMeanwhile, new figures compiled in the note show the scale of the increase in online shopping during the pandemic, with record numbers of Eircode searches.Separately, in a briefing on climate issues, officials state that while the drop off in economic activity and travel from the Covid-19 pandemic will lead to reductions in both air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions, the true emissions impact – which will be outlined by the EPA – will not emerge until October 2021."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324506.1596782289!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gove announces 650m brexit support package for the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove visited Northern Ireland on Friday with Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis.

A new £650 million Brexit support and peace and reconciliation package for Northern Ireland was announced by British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who was visiting the North on Friday.The funding comprises £300 million of support for the European Union’s Peace Plus programme and £355 million to assist traders in the North deal with the complications of Brexit. Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4325701.1596886065!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"regulations allowing garda%C3%AD enforce restrictions in kildare offaly and laois signed into law","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardaí have said they will have a ‘visible presence’ in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly from today. File photograph: Crispin RodwellThe Gardaí have said they will have a “high visible presence” in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly from today onwards as tough new Covid-19 restrictions come into force.On Friday night Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly signed into law new public health measures which are due to last for two weeks, with many businesses ordered to close amid rising clusters.However, Acting Chief Medical Officer Ronan Glynn has warned there is no guarantee the restrictions will be lifted in a fortnight.The National Public Health Emergency Team also warned the Government that this local lockdown could be extended to other areas.Dr Glynn said the purpose of the recommendations was to make them before there was significant community transmission.In a letter to Government, Dr Glynn said the NPHET “emphasised that the measures being put in place today could apply to any other region in the future”.He said while admissions to hospitals and critical care, as well as levels of deaths, are not currently showing worrying trends there may be a delay before changes to these indicators become apparent.Under the measures, residents of Kildare, Laois and Offaly can now only travel within their own county except for work, medical appointments or vital family reasons.Restaurants and cafes have been ordered to close their indoor areas, while hotels cannot accommodate tourists except for guests already present.The restrictions mean all indoor gatherings must now be restricted to a maximum of 6 people from no more than three households .Outdoor gatherings will be limited to 15 people.Most visits to residential facilities and prisons will not be allowed while over 70s have been told to stay at home as much as possible.All cinemas, theatres, betting shops, gyms, leisure centres, will have to close in the three counties.There will be no sporting events or matches.However, creches and hairdressers may remain open.An attendance limit of 25 people outdoors is set for a funerals or six people indoors.Meat-processing plantsAnnouncing the move, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government was forced to make “difficult decisions” in imposing new restrictions.“We can’t afford to wait and see, the disease is not waiting,” he said.Over the past 14 days, 289 cases of Covid-19 have emerged in these three counties representing almost half of all cases detected in the State during that time.Most of the cases are linked to food-processing plants in the region, with two factories having over 80 cases.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said there cannot be situations where those working in meat factories are afraid to take sick pay and they must feel secure enough to get a test.NPHET confirmed yesterday that another four people with coronavirus in the State had died and there were and 98 new confirmed cases of Covid-19.This is the highest one-day rise in new confirmed cases since May 22nd.Meanwhile the Department of Education released new guidance for schools, yesterday meaning secondary students and primary and post-primary teachers will be required to wear face coverings in class when a physical distance of 2m cannot be

Britain and Belgium have imposed travel restrictions on one another. Photograph:  Francois WalschaertsAFP via Getty ImagesAuthorities issued appeals to the public to don face masks, keep distancing and exercise caution towards travel as a string of countries registered spikes in coronavirus infections across Europe.In France, cases have risen steeply to reach levels not seen since May, with more than 3,600 infections registered within 48 hours this week.“The virus continues to circulate very actively worldwide. There is an upward trend in France and Europe,” health ministry chief Jerome Salomon told a news conference. President Emmanuel Macron called a meeting of a defence council to address the rise and urged citizens to don face masks even in outdoor spaces.“I recommend the utmost vigilance,” Mr Macron said. “Get used to wearing your masks.”Italy saw a jump of 552 cases on Friday, the highest level since May, with the northeastern region of Veneto accounting for almost a third of the infections.“Vacations are a risk,” warned Veneto governor Luca Zaia, saying that most cases were found in people who had returned from travel in Spain, Peru, Malta, Croatia, and Greece.“Everyone must decide where they want to go on vacation, but it’s also true, that by us, for a couple of weeks now, we’re seeing a concentration of patients who were infected on vacation.”LockdownsHealth officials in Greece have sounded the alarm over an uptick in cases including on popular tourist islands, after its public health body recorded 150 overnight in the highest level for weeks.Preston became the latest British city to be put under tightened lockdown measures, as Britain and Belgium imposed travel restrictions on each other.\u0026nbspA pork processing plant in West Flanders reported 67 coronavirus infections, joining a string mass outbreaks in the meat industry, including in Ireland, Greece, Germany, the United States and Australia.Norway warned its citizens against all travel abroad, while Austria became the latest country to restrict travel to Spain due to an upsurge in the virus there as it reported 1,895 new infections in a day.Spanish health experts have called for an independent assessment of why Spain became one of the worst hit countries, despite its strong health system.“This evaluation should not be conceived as an instrument for apportioning blame,” the 20 experts wrote in the Lancet, asking why there had been more than 28,000 deaths and more than 50,000 health workers infected in a country with “one of the best performing health systems in the world”.InroadsThe disease appears to be making inroads in countries that previously escaped the worst of the pandemic, with upticks in infections in both Czech Republic and Slovakia, which have so far seen just 389 and 31 deaths respectively.Further afield Hong Kong, which is experiencing a third wave of infections, made free mass testing available for all citizens. The country has managed to limit deaths to just 46, but has seen an uptick in cases with new diagnoses coming in at a rate of over 100 per day for almost a fortnight.Japan, which has had a death toll so far of just over 1,000, is also experiencing mounting cases with 1,580 infections reported on Friday.The city of Melbourne in Australia has begun a six-week total lockdown, while the Philippines has reimposed a lockdown on about a quarter of the country’s 107 million people, after seeing a surge of cases in and around its capital Manila that fuelled infections to jump by 3,561 on Thursday.Despite steeply rising cases in Poland, the government said a lockdown was not on the cards.“There is no way that we would impose a general lockdown again,” said health minister Lukasz Szumowski. “There is no talk today, with the rising number of infected people or very high number of those who are still infected, of coming back to closing the economy.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4325002.1596827530!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british cash for northern ireland shows scale of brexit disruption","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish cabinet office minister Michael Gove visited the Ulster Carpets factory in Co Armagh on Friday in the course of his visit to Northern Ireland. Photograph: Press EyePA WireAn announcement of £650 million in funding for Northern Ireland was proclaimed by the British government as a “major . . . investment” and statement of London’s “commitment” to the people and businesses there. But dig into the numbers and the spin is apparent.Of the headline figure, £300 million is peace funding that had already been pledged back in January 2019, to continue joint projects with the European Union.The rest is spending on new import procedures for goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain and the rest of the non-EU world that is only necessary due to Brexit. It could therefore be presented as a cost to the taxpayer rather than a bonus.Beneath the rather disingenuous packaging, there is some substance that industry figures in the North have welcomed – though with caveats.In all, £200 million is dedicated to setting up and running for two years a trader support service, which is essentially designed to take care of import procedures and their associated costs that businesses would otherwise have to shoulder themselves.What happens after the two years and the £200 million ends is currently uncertain, but British sources insisted it was intended as an ongoing commitment.The remainder of the money is for the IT systems that would support the service “to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined”, according to the British government.The trader support service does not cover everything. It does not include import VAT obligations, and would not cover the most onerous kind of check, the sanitary and phytosanitary controls that are required to prevent any threats to plant, animal or human health from goods of plant or animal origin.It also does not cover export health certificates, required to export animals or animal products from Britain into the North or the EU from January. It’s for businesses only, so it does not include sales of goods from Britain to private iniduals in Northern Ireland, such as through online shopping.There are also numerous things that are yet to be settled. Whether or not businesses will be faced with the onerous tariff schedule of the World Trade Organisation on trade with Britain depends on if a deal can be reached on time.ExemptionBritain is hoping to get the EU to agree to an exemption for major supermarket chains in Northern Ireland from the need to comply with the sea border checks, arguing that such big companies can be trusted to keep goods from leaking into the Republic, and easily caught if they were not.Northern Ireland is the poorest part of the UK any step to avoid additional costs being passed on to consumers who cannot afford them is positive.The issue raises the question of whether the Irish Government’s arrangements will be equivalent in alleviating costs for businesses in the Republic.Any uneven situation between north and south creates incentives for smuggling and bad actors, and competition to businesses that do everything above board.Customs formalities will apply on all goods entering the whole island from Britain as of January, whether a deal is signed or not.In addition, all traders with Britain will need an economic operators registration and identification number issued by the EU.The figure of £200 million for two years indicates the scale of cost that also faces businesses in the Republic from January, without the daunting prospect of tariffs if no deal is reached on top.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It lighted every peak, crevasse, and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined.”Just four hours after the ‘Trinity’ test, the first nuclear detonation in history, a ship leaves San Francisco, bound for Tinian Island in the South West Pacific. On board is Little Boy, only the second nuclear bomb ever created.That night the people of Hiroshima feel relatively safe. They have grown so used to American B-29 bombers passing overhead, they have nicknamed them ‘B-San’ or ‘Mr B’. Like the rest of the world, they have never heard of the atom bomb. They do not know that Hiroshima has deliberately been spared conventional bombing so its devastating effects will be clear. Little Boy’s final destination is still not set. The US Targeting Committee has narrowed the possible targets down to three: Hiroshima, Kokura and Nagasaki. The ultimate decision will be chosen based on prevailing weather conditions.6th August. 00.02 For the first time, the crew of the B-29 named Enola Gay is told what weapon they will be carrying. Captain William ‘Deak’ Parsons informs them it will be the most furious explosion since creation, that it might crack the Earth’s crust. In Hiroshima, it is a clear night full of shooting stars.02.45 The Enola Gay takes off. It has been named after pilot Colonel Paul Tibbett’s “courageous red-haired mother”. In Tibbett’s pocket are cyanide capsules, one for each member of his crew, in case of capture. As the aeroplane heaves itself into the air, the crew still do not know where they are heading.04.00 Dr Michihiko Hachiya, a physician at the Hiroshima Communications Hospital, finishes his air raid duty. There is nothing to report.06.41 Captain Parsons begins arming the warhead. He has taken it upon himself to do this en route, dismantling and reassembling Little Boy in the freezing bomb bay. Four heavily-laden B-29s have recently crashed taking off from the Tinian runway, which ends in a cliff. Little Boy weighs 9,700 lbs and required special sunken bays to be dug just to load it into the aircraft. The chance of catastrophe is too great.07.29 “The hour was early the morning still, warm, and beautiful,” Dr Hachiya noted in his diary. “Shimmering leaves, reflecting sunlight from a cloudless sky, made a pleasant contrast with shadows in my garden as I gazed absently through wide-flung doors opening to the south.”High above, the weather plane assigned to check conditions in Hiroshima ahead of the mission passes over the city. An air raid siren greets it, but it’s just Mr B making his rounds. Only now is the target set.08.14 Bombardier Thomas Ferebee on board Enola Gay spots the Aioi Hashi, a T-shaped bridge at the heart of the city. A tone warns the crew of the aircraft to brace themselves. The citizens of Hiroshima hear nothing but a distant thrum. There is no siren. The fireball is hotter than the surface of the sun. Almost everything within one mile of the centre is vaporised instantly. Winds of more than 650 miles per hour turn every shard of wood not immediately incinerated into shrapnel. One quarter of a city of 350,000 are killed instantly. The mountains that surround the city, which gave Hiroshima such pleasant weather, produce a ‘focussing effect’ for the shockwave.The bomb is a grotesque act of creation. It took some of the world’s finest and most creative minds, and $2 billion (more than £18 billion in today’s money), to bring it to life. At the moment of detonation it replaces the historic city of Hiroshima with something new. Hiroshima was known as Mizu no Miyako or the ‘City of Water’. Now it is, according to Dr Hachiya, “no longer a city but a burnt-over prairie”, a City of Fire.Naked survivors, the patterns of their clothes burned into their backs, wander dazed through the inferno, driven by an unbearable thirst. Many die in reservoirs, swimming pools and water tanks, or drown in the swift Ōta river. The outline of the sun through the dust is red. A black rain falls from the sky. Hiroshima is now, in a word repeated over and over again by survivors, “Hell.”It took J Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, 15 minutes to accept the possibility of fission, then a week to sketch Little Boy on his blackboard. He explained: “When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it.”Yet at heart, Little Boy was barely more sophisticated than a medieval cannon, firing a uranium bullet down a tube into a target. The scientists were so confident the contraption would work, they never bothered to test it. The Trinity ‘gadget’ and Fat Man, the bomb later dropped on Nagasaki, were more sophisticated ‘implosion’ devices.The technology developed quickly after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Massive weapons like the thermonuclear Tzar Bomba (thousands of times more powerful than Little Boy) gave way to missile defence shields like Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars, which in turn inspired smarter missiles. The creative spiral was only averted by bans and treaties that are now decaying. There are currently around 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world, down from a high of 70,000 in 1986. How does Little Boy compare to their power? Sharon Squassoni, a global security expert from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, bursts into laughter. It’s not reassuring.“There’s just no comparison, the shift in our nuclear arsenal is astounding. We have a wide range of power and capabilities. We even have bombs where you can dial in the yield before use.”Moreover, the trend towards smaller weapons designed for less indiscriminate destruction doesn’t necessarily make us safer. Seth Baum, executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, explains:“In military circles, the overall trend over the years has been away from mass destruction to precision, reducing collateral damage. However, the argument goes that precision actually makes it more likely that we might use them.”New and ever more versatile weapons are now on the horizon, from unpredictable hypersonic delivery systems designed to zig-zag past missile shields, to high-altitude strikes that would disable our electronics and communications networks.For some, the old ways are still the best. The relative simplicity of gun-type devices like Little Boy mean they are perfect for terrorists looking to assemble their own. With the proliferation of nuclear states and lax security in countries of the former Soviet Union, getting fissile material is less a problem than you might think. One Russian prosecutor in a case involving the theft of uranium noted that potatoes were guarded better. There is no reason why a modern-day remake of Little Boy would be any less powerful than the original, says Squassoni. “Of course it would be as powerful as Hiroshima. Little Boy was 15 kilotons – that’s a pretty small bomb.”The hard part has already been done. Creating the bomb was difficult. Recreating it isn’t.In the days afterwards, the explosion is named the ‘pikadon’ by survivors: “flash–bang”. However, those closest to the epicentre insist on calling it simply ‘pika’. They do not remember the boom, only the flare then an eerie silence, a moment of time caught in light like a camera flash.“I remember vividly how a stone lantern in the garden became brilliantly lit,” wrote Dr Hachiya.The atomic bomb uses light as a weapon. It converts matter into energy at the speed of light, and some of its designers had suggested sounding a “super powerful siren” before detonation, to blind anyone who looked up and happened to catch sight of the flash. The survivors were left with an unforgettable image.“That beautiful cloud! Its beauty defies description,” recalled a friend of Dr Hachiya. “I have never seen anything so magnificent in my life!”The doctor noted that “it was at the moment of the birth of this cloud, with its ever-changing colour, that Hiroshima was wiped out. It was at this moment that Hiroshima city, the culmination of many years\u0027 work, disappeared with her good citizens into the beautiful sky.”The ‘mushroom cloud’ became the bomb’s own trademark. It had to be seen to be feared. Some Manhattan Project scientists had wanted to stage demonstrations of the weapon for Japanese generals to convince them to surrender, rather than a live bombing. Hiroshima was selected partly because the damage would be “sufficiently spectacular…when publicity on it is released.” This wasn’t just an act of war, it was a media event. “There stood the Enola Gay, bathed in floodlights like the star of a Hollywood movie,” Colonel Tibbetts recalled about boarding the plane. “For the next 20 minutes we were put through a photo routine to which none of us were accustomed.” As they returned to base, tail gunner Bob Caron snapped a picture of the cloud that sprouted behind them. His would be the only official photographs successfully developed from the mission. He wrote to his mother, asking her to collect press clippings for their scrap book.The view was different from the ground.“Many times I tried to trip the shutter release but the victim would ask for pity,” one Japanese photographer said about touring the aftermath. “It was too cruel, too inhuman to ignore their pleadings.”“If I had known it was an atom bomb, I don’t think I would have ever tried taking pictures.”The strike soon developed into an information war. Initial official reports to the Japanese people were that the US had deployed a new, ‘special bomb’, but the damage was minimal. In Hiroshima, what we would now call ‘fake news’ proliferated among the survivors. Some heard that the city would be uninhabitable for 75 years. There were rumours that Japan had secretly developed its own ‘special’ bombs, and had destroyed Los Angeles among other American cities.American wanted the truth to be known, at least for now. Leaflets were dropped on potential further targets featuring Caron’s snapshot. It noted that “the atomic bomb’s horrendous destructive power can be understood by viewing this photo.” An earlier leaflet dropped on Hiroshima had warned civilians that although the targets were military, “unfortunately, bombs have no eyes.”Seventy-five years later the atomic information war is still raging, but has moved from leaflets to social media. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists warns of a general poisoning of our ‘information ecosphere’, including “sophisticated, technology-propelled propaganda” and leaders throwing doubt on scientists and “national institutions that have historically provided societal stability and cohesion.” The hacking of Twitter in July, in which accounts including American Democratic nominee Joe Biden sent out spam messages, had dark implications. President Trump, apparently not hacked, once tweeted that he had a “much bigger and more powerful” nuclear button than Kim Jong Un.“I don’t think nuclear war could be started by hacking into Twitter,” says Squassoni, “but when you have the leaders of countries issuing nuclear threats on it, that’s a serious development.”Hiroshima’s after-image faded into the culture of the atomic 20th Century, the ultimate symbol of danger and progress. Children could draw the cloud\u0027s silhouette, like Mickey Mouse. It influenced everything from the nuclear-powered rage of Godzilla to the bikini swimsuit, named for nuclear tests on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands.Meanwhile, Hiroshima and its people found themselves transformed into silent symbols. The mushroom cloud. The ruined dome. Kengo Nikawa’s pocket watch, stuck forever at 8.15. And for some, just their shadow, burned into the wall behind them, like a photo negative.9th August 1945. It is a cloudy day in Nagasaki. 40,000 people are blasted into memory. The original target for Fat Man, the second and so far final nuclear bomb used in warfare, was Kokura. It is skipped over due to a thick hanging fog.Meanwhile, Hiroshima is still in the shadow of the first bombing, with many survivors now living in Dr Hachiya’s hospital. A horse, burned and blind, ambles around its garden, eating the leaves of a potato patch the doctor had planted.Eleven days after the blast, more baffling symptoms become evident. People who were relatively unscathed develop speckles on their skin, then die. Another mystery: epilation.“Falling hair! This was an unusual symptom, but undeniable. Unconsciously, I grabbed some of my hair and pulled. I did not have much hair in the first place, but the amount that came out made me feel sick,” wrote Dr Hachiya.No one knows what is happening. They are in the dark.“The idea was to explode the damned thing,” recalled Hymer Friedell, who oversaw biomedical research at the Manhattan Project and later toured Hiroshima. “We weren\u0027t terribly concerned with the radiation”The world experts on the subject were now those who lived through it. Dr Hachiya noted that the closer the survivors were to the centre of the blast, the more likely they were to develop these novel symptoms, placing each patient on a map. The value of this data did not go unnoticed.Navy Secretary James Forrestal told President Truman that survivors would offer “a unique opportunity for the study of the medical and biological effects of radiation which is of utmost importance to the United States.” A legion of international scientists descended on Japan and the survivors. Reports from local doctors were collected and expanded upon. The survivors were to be studied, not necessarily treated. A cure was never an option.Many ‘hibakusha’, as they came to be known, found themselves outcasts. Their stories were censored by the American occupation, while they were shunned by society at large.“Every survivor has had a different experience,” says Takuo Takigawa, director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. “Some people didn’t want to go near them because they were ‘infected’. With others, there was a thought that they would soon die anyway.”Hibakusha were banned from public baths, for fear of contaminating the water. People refused to employ them, and certainly wouldn\u0027t marry one. The spectre of radiation exposure transformed into the idea that they were inherently sullied. Some chose to never have children.“At that time in Japan any physical deformation or injury was heavily shunned,” says Barak Kushner, professor of East Asian history at Cambridge. However, the shame extended even to those without visible injuries. “In some ways they are symbols of Japan’s failure and defeat, and of the poverty to which Japan has sunk, as it’s not able to help them. They don’t get specific compensation until years later.”Meanwhile, studies moved from the immediate aftermath to the long term. By 1950, 130,000 survivors were enrolled in what is known as the ‘Life Span Study’. It precisely surveyed where each survivor was standing relative to the blast, just as Dr Hachiya had done. Surviving hibakusha have reported for check ups right up to today.The study forms the world’s largest bank of knowledge on the effect of radiation on the human body. It is so thorough that in 1982, scientists at the Los Alamos National Lab built a replica of Little Boy – including the uranium – to better understand its findings. It helped develop safe medical uses for radiation, like CAT scans and X-rays. Nasa consulted it to help protect astronauts from cosmic radiation. Now the survey is focussing on the next generation, tracking possible effects on survivors’ children.“The rainy season officially ended yesterday,” Takigawa chuckles. “Today is a very sunny day in Hiroshima.”It is difficult to put a final number on the number killed by the attacks in 1945, given the confusion afterwards and the malignant effects of radiation, but estimates suggest more than 200,000.The rumours that Hiroshima would be uninhabitable for 75 years proved false. Both it and Nagasaki are now thriving. In 1949, a law ordered that Hiroshima be rebuilt as a “Peace Memorial City, a symbol of the ideal of making lasting peace a reality.” Despite fears over radiation, many citizens chose to stay and rebuild the city they loved. Before the war it had a population of around 350,000. Now it’s more than 2 million. The ruin of the industrial museum remains preserved at the centre, the dome cracked and open to the sky.Once forgotten and ignored by the world at large, the hibakusha became figureheads for peace movements worldwide. The Memorial Museum was established at least partly to remind the world that the victims are people, not just symbols.“The hibakusha saw it as a mission of sorts, to tell their story,” says Takigawa. “The reality of what happened, the feelings and memory, must be passed on, so people can feel the horrors of that event themselves.”The threat has not passed, for any of us. Every year since 1947, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, first established by former Manhattan Project workers, set their ‘Doomsday Clock’ to indicate how near we are to annihilation. This year it ticked to 100 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been. They point to the breakdown of arms control treaties a general worsening of relations between the great powers and climate change as contributing factors.“The world is sleepwalking its way through a newly unstable nuclear landscape,” the Bulletin warned. “Any belief that the threat of nuclear war has been vanquished is a mirage.”Moreover, nuclear weapons now have to compete with a wide variety of impending disasters.“They’ve fallen out of the public consciousness, but polling 20 somethings shows they actually believe they will be used in the coming decades. The younger generation is very fatalistic. However, nuclear weapons don\u0027t rise to the top of the agenda for them, whereas climate really does,” says Squassoni.After 75 years, the light from that blast has faded in the public consciousness. Simply put, we are no longer afraid of the atom bomb. Then again, neither were the people of Hiroshima.Few people live in constant fear of the newer threats Seth Baum specialises in, from artificial intelligence to designer viruses that would make coronavirus balk. They’re threats most will never have imagined, right up until the point they happen.“The last time that happened was the September 11 terrorist attack, which was low-tech, but it caught us off guard and changed how we think about the world,” says Baum. “So did coronavirus.”Takigawa says Hiroshima takes pride in teaching the world a lesson about peace, even though it had to suffer terribly for it. “There may be other ways of learning this lesson, but I can’t think of any,” he notes. In 2016, Barack Obama became the first US president to visit the site of the bombing. He gave a touching speech, paying tributes to the hibakusha and noting that “the scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.” It’s another admirable lesson, just one of many we’ve learned from Hiroshima and Nagaski: technologically, medically, politically and philosophically.Yet, fundamentally, they’re not lessons the people of Hiroshima needed to learn on 6 August 1945. We can learn from the dead. They can’t learn by dying. All they would ever know is one simple fact: that, in Obama’s words, “on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky, and the world was changed.”We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beirut blast missile may have blame says lebanons president","story":"Lebanon’s president has suggested that a missile could have been responsible for the catastrophic Beirut blast, as the country’s entrenched ruling class comes under increasing pressure from enraged citizens to resign.In a televised interview on Friday, Michel Aoun rejected calls for an international investigation into the disaster, which killed more than 150 people, saying it could have been caused by “negligence or foreign interference through a missile or bomb”.Experts have discounted the missile theory, pointing out that a fire burning at the port warehouse before the explosion was sufficient to cause the detonation of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored there.Meanwhile, the head of Hizbollah denied that his powerful Shia militant group had stored arms at the port.“We have nothing in the port: not an arms depot, nor a missile depot, nor missiles, nor rifles, nor bombs, nor bullets, nor nitrate,” Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech broadcast on Friday.Their statements will do little to dissipate public anger, with demonstrations calling for the overthrow of the government expected to be held on Saturday, following clashes between protesters and security forces on Thursday.Several people were injured in the clashes near the parliament building in downtown Beirut, where officers fired tear gas after protesters threw stones at security forces, lit fires and vandalised nearby buildings.Five British medical professionals flew out on Friday to help, after more than 5,000 people were injured in the blast, the Department for International Development said.“The UK is sending these world-leading medics to use their expertise and to make sure the people of Lebanon get the help they need as quickly as possible,” Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the International Development Secretary, said.The UK Government also announced £3 million for the British Red Cross for medical and humanitarian assistance, in addition to an earlier pledge of £5 million.But on the ground in Beirut, the failure of Lebanese leaders to take responsibility for the blast is enraging citizens, who have renewed calls advanced in nationwide protests last year for the entire government to resign.So far, only one member of parliament and the ambassador to Jordan have quit in response to the blast, which many Lebanese say was the result of decades of corruption and mismanagement. Offering her resignation in a televised address on Thursday, Tracy Chamoun, who has served as ambassador since 2017, blamed the disaster on a corrupt political elite in power since the 1975-1990 civil war.“They all must go,” Ms Chamoun said. “This is total negligence.”International leaders are also calling for widespread reform of Lebanon’s governance system. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, told Lebanese citizens who mobbed him during his visit to Beirut on Thursday that international aid would not be passed into “corrupt hands”.Surrounded by demonstrators clamouring for help to oust their reviled leadership, Mr Macron said he was not there to endorse the “regime” but would ask Lebanon’s leaders to accept “a new political deal” and “to change the system”.A rare nationwide protest movement began last October, sparked by an unpopular proposal to tax the WhatsApp messaging app. Demonstrators called for the overthrow of a political oligarchy they accused of enriching itself while hollowing out the state, forcing Saad Hariri to step down as prime minister.Further unrest is expected in the coming days as Lebanese activists have called for “Saturday of Revenge” protests in Beirut this weekend.“We will hang the gallows,” read a message, accompanied by an image of a noose, on one Instagram account with 42,000 followers.“We are anticipating tens of thousands of people to protest in Beirut and other cities in Lebanon on Saturday,” said Joel Gulhane, an analyst with the UK-based Risk Advisory Group.“We are likely to see a return to the earlier days of the protest movement that began in October,” he added. “But the anger and devastation wrought by the explosion, coupled with the sharp decline in quality of life … means that the upcoming period is likely to be more violent than before.”     More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"germans dont worship health service better","story":"In judging our Covid-19 performance, we naturally compare it with that of other countries. The most telling comparison is with nations whose predicament is closest to ours. Enormous countries, such as China, Brazil and the US, are not closely comparable. Nor are much poorer countries, or more thinly populated ones.The natural comparisons are Western European, and even here, there are important differences. The Scandinavian countries, with their small, well-extended populations, are not so close to the British experience, although we should learn from their medical systems. The nearest comparisons, surely, are quite densely populated neighbours with roughly similar populations and GDP, urban concentrations and large international airports. That means France, Italy, Germany and, perhaps, Spain.The eventual Covid-19 post-mortem will no doubt unearth mistakes that are uniquely British, but if you look at the story so far, you will see that neither Britain, France, Italy, or Spain has done markedly better than one another. In deaths per million of the population – a more meaningful comparator than total numbers – we, at 684, are the worst of these four but the others are bad too (Italy 582, France 462. Plucky little Belgium, by the way, seems to be the world’s worst, at 851). The only one in a different league is Germany, at 110.Why might this be? First, Germany had the “luck” to get an early case of the coronavirus. A female business traveller from Shanghai arrived on January 16 and fell ill with the virus. She was treated at the Munich Schwabing Hospital. A consequent cluster of 16 cases was identified. On February 13, at the country’s Science Media Centre, a huge press conference reported the scientific findings in detail. The press release warned that “every day the spread is not controlled, the likelihood that the epidemic will develop into a pandemic increases”.But the mere fact of a disease being identified does not mean the authorities know what to do about it. The Germans did. I am no expert on Germany, but here are a few factors.Expertise. The Munich hospital has a special unit for highly contagious life-threatening infections. Its chief physician spoke at the press conference. So did the professor who had developed one of the first tests for Covid-19, as did the president of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, the government’s public health institute. Lockdown was quicker than in Britain, but less draconian and more targeted.Testing (mainly for flu) is a more established part of life in Germany than in Britain. It has gone on apace throughout Covid. Also, where the NHS closed down, the normal German health system kept going. Patients with Covid were not, as they were here, told to stay at home unaided. They were constantly monitored. If their oxygen levels dropped too low, they were admitted to hospital. The needs of care homes were not ignored. No patient was sent to a care home unless it could provide 14 days’ quarantine.Media. Far more German journalists are well acquainted with science than are their British counterparts. They give the public clearer facts and fewer scare stories.Dispersal. Unlike Britain, Germany is a country of many different centres, with associated airports – Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt and so on, rather than London, London and more London. So there was less danger of a sudden explosion of the plague.A related fact is that the country is federal. Sixteen states, rather than the central government, are responsible for most aspects of health care. This sometimes slows things down, but it also means that, compared with Britain, there is more local “buy-in”, more local players who get going, rather than waiting upon a distant bureaucracy.This creates a good spread of service across Germany. There were plenty of labs for testing, for example, in plenty of places. There was no appalling rush. When Britain finally got round to test and trace, the Government commissioned Serco to run it from a single call centre in Scotland. As the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, points out, you are more likely to comply with tracing from a knowledgeable employee of your county council than a call from a student hundreds of miles away. In Germany, the “corona-detectors” are a respected body of local experts.Good politics. Many in Britain have grown rather fed up with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, what with her ambiguous speeches and her hostility to Brexit. Her star has gradually waned even at home. Nevertheless, she is a scientist by training and an experienced, steady person. She can command respect in the crisis, precisely because she is not, in any detailed sense, in charge of Covid policy. Rather than having to pretend she has all the answers, she can exercise moral authority.Mrs Merkel is in this enviable position because – astonishing to British eyes – she runs a country in which health care is not usually high on the list of political controversies. In Britain, the health secretary – currently Matt Hancock – has to run all hospitals and the fifth largest workforce in the world. At the same time, he has to spend days in the House of Commons being assailed by accusations that he is trying to “sell off” the NHS and similar nonsense. The German health minister (an able man called Jens Spahn) has infinitely less power, but – no offence to Mr Hancock – can do more practical good. His role has not been to try to run a vast, unmanageable empire, but simply to oil the wheels of a system which already works, by putting in more government money – covering the costs of testing, and paying for ICU beds to be kept available.Why is Germany free of what Mr Hunt calls “the political poison” of our system? Not because Germans don’t care about health – they actually spend a higher proportion of their GDP on it than we do, and they have better health outcomes. It is because they have never bought the doctrine that a particular health care system is sacred.The origins of good health care for ordinary Germans lie in mutual funds in the 19th century, set up to help pay for funerals. These developed into much more sophisticated, competing systems of health insurance, underwritten by the state, but not run by it. Employer and employee both contribute. An unemployed person has his health care paid for in his unemployment insurance. Almost no German citizen falls through the net.The providers are also various. Government-run hospitals are outnumbered by privately run ones and others run by charities (many, for instance by the Order of St John). Because the money follows the patient, the providers have good incentives to provide. Indeed, the problem in Germany is too many hospital beds.In Britain, the health service is an object of high emotion. Behind the praise often lies a fear that it is precarious. In Germany, there is little emotional commitment to the service – rather as, here, there is little intense feeling for Sainsbury’s or Waitrose. Instead of high emotion, there is a high level of confidence. This may help explain why so many more Germans than British have returned to work, although Covid numbers jump upwards from time to time. Psychologically and medically, the German way is better for the national health than is the thing we call the National Health Service.Do you agree that the German health service is better than the NHS?

Estimates between groups vary widely, and government policy appears to be driven by the flimsiest of results.After a northern lockdown was imposed, chief medical officer Chris Whitty warned that Britain may have reached the limits of lifting restrictions, leading to fears that pubs and shops may have to shut so schools can reopen in September.But what is the data actually showing and how reliable is it?Take the weekly pilot infection survey’ results from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) that prompted Boris Johnson to bring in new restrictions in the north west at the beginning of August.The ONS estimated that 35,700 people in England were infected with Covid-19 between July 20 and July 26, or 1 in 1,500 people. The week before statisticians had calculated about 27,700 were infected, or about 1 in 2,000. Warning lights flashed and widespread hand-wringing commenced.However, the new calculation was based on just 59 people testing positive out of a six weekly total of 116,026 swab tests. The previous week just 45 people tested positive out of a running total of 114,674. So just 14 extra positive tests had triggered mass panic.Oddly enough, when the figures fell to 1,100 in June, journalists were told to ignore it as a data blip, and we have been regularly warned that determining infection rates on such low ONS numbers is fraught with difficulty. This time, however, the ONS said it suggest a slight increase.“When ONS  stated ‘suggests’ it’s a signal something doesn’t add up,” said one Oxford academic.Unsurprisingly, the hugely erratic figures swung back the other way on Friday, with the ONS estimating that 1 in 1,900 people are now infected, or 28,300 in total - 3,700 new cases a day.Again, though, it was based on just 53 people testing positive, so just six people fewer than the previous week. Hardly a conclusive finding. Meanwhile the King’s College app, which has been tracking symptoms from March and now has 3.5 million users, paints a much more optimistic picture. The data set is the largest out there and now includes swab testing. Yet its estimates have consistently been lower than most. The app estimates there are about 26,500 infections in the whole of the UK, and 1,439 new cases per day in England - nearly three times lower than the ONS figures than prompted northern lockdown. King\u0027s researchers believe that cases have been stable for several weeks with no evidence of a second wave.Nowcasting by Public Health England (PHE) and the University of Cambridge also suggests cases are flatlining, or possibly falling slightly. But it is not just surveillance data that is muddying the waters. Trying to establish trends from the number of people testing positive for coronavirus is also bedevilled with problems. The decision to lockdown in the north was also based on community and healthcare testing that appeared to be trending upwards.Through July, testing showed a rise from about 500 cases a day to 750. However when picked apart, it became clear that Pillar 2 (tests in the community) were trending up while Pillar 1 (tests in healthcare settings) were trending down.While more cases in the community might seem problematic, there was no equivalent rise in hospital admissions or death rates, suggesting it was mild cases that were being spotted. The number of very sick people continues to fall so the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed.Look a bit more closely at the Pillar 1 rise and it becomes clear that the increase may actually be a result of more testing. Between July 1 and July 31, the seven-day moving average for Pillar 1 tests jumped by 20 per cent and Pillar 2 by 82 per cent. When the rise in positive tests is mapped against the rise in testing, Pillar 2 is shown as flatlining and Pillar 1 declines a little more sharply.Test, track and trace is also likely to be skewing the figures, particularly in hotspots like Leicester.It stands to reason that testing people who have been in contact with those known to be infected will find more infections. That’s the whole point after all. It will pick up those who did not even know they have the disease and would never have been tested normally. It should be possible to account for this bias, but it is not being done.It is also unclear how reliable the government’s figures are. On July 28, Pillar 1 reported 64 cases and Pillar 2 512 cases - 576 in total,  yet the government website reported a total of 547. In May, it emerged that tens of thousands of cases had been double counted, and it appears that it is still a problem. When local lockdowns are being determined on low numbers to begin with, a missing 29 cases-a-day really matters. Overall there seems to be no evidence of a second wave. Figures out from Imperial this week suggested cases had continued to fall after the easing of lockdown restrictions. One in two hospital trusts have not reported a death in the past seven days and three quarters have not seen a death in the past 48 hours. Despite differences in daily rates, all groups seem to agree that about 8 people in 10,000 are infected and the R rate is unlikely to be above 1 for England. Professor Karol Sikora, dean of medicine at the University of Buckingham, said: “At the peak there were around 3,000 coroanvirus patients admitted to hospital in England. The number is now around 60. There are 694 patients in hospital, down from 17,000. These are huge drops, and most importantly, they are continuing to fall.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"heatwave continue next week beaches brace another day tourists","story":"The heatwave currently sweeping the UK is due to continue towards the end of next week, as the country\u0027s beaches brace themselves for another wave of day-trippers.Temperatures are expected to hit over 30 degrees over the weekend and well into next week, particularly in the South, according to the Met Office.Yesterday Heathrow and Kew Gardens reached a high of 36.4 degrees - making it the hottest day in August since 2003, and the fifth hottest on record.In Bournemouth, visitors were said to have arrived at the beach as early as 3am to bag the best spots.As many as 70 coastguard callouts were made before midday as thousands headed to the coast to make the most of Britain\u0027s beaches.This included 14,000 people packed on the sandy beach at Perranporth in Cornwall where 15 rescues launched were launched.The RNLI yesterday warned about the dangers of inflatable paddle boards and kayaks being used on the UK\u0027s holiday hotspots.Steve Instance, the South West sea safety lead with the charity, said: Inflatable stand up paddle boards and kayaks can be taken by the tide and wind very, very easily.People can fall off them and get separated.

We were promised a “world-beating” system to identify local outbreaks and enable less disruptive interventions: small numbers isolating, closing inidual schools and workplaces, or, at worst, locking down a street or borough. This was supposed to mimic South Korea: the nation of 51 million which avoided a national lockdown thanks to mass testing and tracing.The UK not only had a first lockdown but the new measures being introduced are increasingly broad. Two in five people in the North West are now under household restrictions – despite few confirmed cases in many localities. People returning from entire countries, rather than just affected regions, are required to self-isolate. Boris Johnson has warned of the risk of a second wave “within two weeks”, a shocking admission. If testing and tracing were working, none of this would be happening.At present, not enough people are coming forward for testing and there are serious deficiencies in identifying contacts. The Government’s testing regime found just 5,300 of 35,700 estimated cases identified by the Office for National Statistics between July 27 and August 2. The latest weekly tracing statistics are also worrying: almost half of the friends and family of iniduals who test positive are not being reached. We also have no idea whether people are complying with requests to isolate. “It’s a bit of a half-arsed system – it kinda works, but not really,” Professor Christina Pagel of University College London concludes.It’s time for a serious rethink. To start, the Government must learn the lesson from the failure of Public Health England’s highly centralised testing regime. Even after the department took control in April, it refused to decentralise responsibilities. Instead, it built a small number of large lighthouse labs and created ineffective national tracing call centres.This centralisation has hamstrung the entire system. Tests take precious days too long to be sent, returned and processed. Care homes that could have used local laboratories were instead left without tests after issues with Randox kits. Smaller labs that could provide speedy results locally have been rebuffed. Local health officials until recently lacked the necessary data to combat outbreaks in their area.By contrast, in Wales – after the Welsh Government botched testing for months – local authorities and hospitals are testing and tracing at the regional level. They have proven relatively agile in responding to local outbreaks. Even in England local authorities such as Blackburn with Darwen council in Lancashire and Sandwell in the West Midlands have given up on the national scheme, set up their own systems and begun knocking on the doors of people who do not return phone calls. Local health teams, who are responsible for dealing with outbreak clusters in schools and workplaces, are successfully reaching 98 per cent of contacts.There is a need for far wider testing. Tests should be offered to people who are asked to isolate – because of travel or contact with a positive case. This would help identify chains of transmission and allow people to cease isolating sooner. The Government claims to have a daily testing capacity of over 335,000, but is testing closer to 175,000 per day. Even this isn’t enough. To find all the cases, we need to mass test millions of people every week. This could be done using new rapid‑testing technologies from the likes of DnaNudge and LamPORE.We also need bigger carrots and sticks to encourage people to get tested and isolate. People are not handing over the names of contacts to avoid putting friends and family in a difficult situation. The average number of contacts provided to tracers is down to two and a half, a decline of 64 per cent since the scheme began. If you have been social enough to get coronavirus, you have probably socialised with more than a couple of people. People may also be refusing to pick up the dreaded “0300” call that will tell you to isolate for 14 days.Payments, and perhaps even fines for non-compliance, would encourage people to get tested and isolate. This would be far less expensive and draconian than spreading coronavirus and a second lockdown. Australians can receive £1,100 for isolation if they do not receive other payments, and can even get £230 while isolating awaiting a test result in Victoria. Payments are combined with large fines – up to £11,100 – for people who break self-isolation orders.The definition of madness is doing the same thing twice, but expecting a different result. A second bout of inadequate testing and tracing will lead to another outbreak and lockdown. This would not only be catastrophic for our physical, mental and economic wellbeing, but also politically disastrous.

Yesterday there were 800. We had no idea this insurance would be so popular”. Pyta has had to bring in a special task force to cope with the “unbelievable” number of enquiries. “Nintey per cent have come from England,” he says. “It’s as if everyone there wants to come on holiday to Portugal.”Scroll down for more news updates.Mustique is among the first in the Caribbean to be welcoming guests back this summer - as long as you\u0027re armed with proof of a negative Covid-19 PCR antigen test carried out at an accredited laboratory 72 hours or fewer before you fly. Just 100 miles west of Barbados, Mustique, a favourite among the Royals, is today home to around 100 fabulous villas, along with two charming boutique hotels, immaculately kept white-sand beaches, a sweet little library and thriving equestrian centre.Nigel Tisdall delves into its fascinating history. Welcome to paradiseHosting doesn\u0027t come naturally to Anna Hart, but she\u0027s had to master the art this summer as she opens her home in Margate to many a visitor.Here are her top dos and don\u0027ts.Nick Gibb insists schools will be safe to return to in England come September, and says dangerous infection rates abroad are constantly monitored to help the government take decisions on quarantine for travellers.I’m not religious, says Sarah Baxter.

Of those, 12,749 have \u0027recovered\u0027 and 389 have died of Covid-19.Health officials have said the recent uptick in cases is due to local clusters and they say hospitalisations, at 116, are well below peaks of over 400 as the government seek to avoid a national lockdown again.However, officials have cautioned that some measures taken to curb the illness are likely to return after the summer holidays when cities become more crowded again and the flu season arrives.The rising number of cases in the Czech Republic prompted Norway this week to re-impose a 10-day quarantine for travellers from the country.Seven safer destinations for a last-minute summer holidayAn absence of other tourists was a recurring theme on Sasha Vasilyuk\u0027s trip to Molise, Italy’s second smallest region, just above Puglia.Despite its historical riches and pristine landscapes, including Pietrabbondante and Saepinum, one of the best-preserved ancient Roman ruins in Italy, it is so unknown that Italians like to joke that “Molise doesn’t exist” (it rhymes in Italian).  She writes:In today’s climate, a lack of visitors is a big plus. This under-the-radar region has become one of the safest choices for Britons eager for an Italian vacation (as of Thursday, it had recorded eight cases in the previous seven days 3 per 100,000). In fact, some lucky travellers have secured a free stay in Molise this summer – in San Giovanni in Galdo, one of its many picturesque villages.Read the rest of the piece here.As of today the face mask rule has been extended in England - meaning coverings are now mandatory in the following:Indoor places of worshipMuseums and galleries Public areas in hotels and hostelsIt comes as figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest that face masks are the new normal in Britain - with 96 per cent of people wearing one to leave the house.The survey, which takes in the period from July 29 to August 2, found that 96 per cent of adults who had left their homes said they had worn a face covering to slow the spread of coronavirus – up from 84 per cent last week and 71 per cent the week before that.Gabriella Swirling reports on the ONS figures here. The Natural History Museum in London reopened this weekGatwick Airport\u0027s South Terminal could remain shut until next summer, bosses warned, as British Airways launched a wave of job cuts.The country\u0027s second-largest airport this week told staff that one of its two terminals may not reopen for a year and redundancies are likely after hopes of a recovery were crushed by new travel restrictions.In a live-streamed town hall meeting with staff on Monday, chief executive Stewart Wingate said the South Terminal cannot return to full operations until carriers\u0027 schedules are restored, employees said.It came as BA began telling thousands of its workers whether they will lose their jobs in a wave of brutal cutbacks.Oliver Gill and Louis Ashworth have the full story.A melting glacier is at risk of breaking apart due to a heatwave, forcing the evacuation of part of an Italian alpine valley, reports Reuters.The alarm was raised on Wednesday when experts in helicopters realised that the Planpincieux glacier, at an altitude of about 2,800 metres in the Ferret Valley in the Mont Blanc massif, was slipping dangerously.A heatwave has created a layer of water under the glacier, which is roughly the size of the Milan cathedral, making it more prone to a break.A photo taken from a helicopter on Friday of the Planpincieux glacierAbout 75 residents and tourists in homes or hotels in hamlets in the threatened part of the valley were evacuated and police threw up roadblocks to prevent others from entering.“The season was going well despite the COVID pandemic,” Jacopo Nitri, who owns a small hotel in the area, told the Corriere. “I had to send away 25 clients and cancel some reservations.

Power up the economy! Wave some dumbbells around your local gym while wearing a suit! All messages relayed in recent days by the Prime Minister, who appears confused by the fact that, after months of government-decreed inertia, people aren’t rushing to get on board with his hasty about-turn.Like much of their response to this pandemic, this sudden acknowledgement that we need to once again engage with life beyond our front doors is too little, too late. For after months of being told that the outside world is a war zone, that all but essential trips are tantamount to a death sentence for the vulnerable, that those who really care must stay in, mask up and shut up, is it any wonder the messaging has stuck?Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak et al might think a few cheesy photo opportunities can unpick the agoraphobia rendering parts of England a ghost island, but they would do far better to accept this current crisis of confidence is one of their own creation. Explaining how and why it is now safe to stop heeding the months’ worth of red flags they have been waving – rather than telling people to get into waters that were apparently shark-infested just moments ago – would surely be a smoother means of managing this period.The initial messaging had to be strident, that much is true – by March 23, we were in a sorrier state than most of Europe. But Johnson is wrong if he thinks that spending a third of the year hammering that same mantra – stay home – can be wiped from the public consciousness by gurning near a treadmill.Over the months of lockdown, we learned to live entirely (or close to it) within our own four walls. Unlearning that now requires as much gusto as the efforts that went into enforcing the shutdown in the first place.The toll – not virus deaths, but the myriad other kinds – is growing clearer. And among it is the damage caused to our cities, and the lives of those who reside there. People choose metropolitan areas to live a life that is out, not in one that is powered by Saturday afternoon football matches and Wednesday night pub trips and Friday evenings at the theatre the quick coffees and dinners and post-work drinks and gym class catch-ups. Cities often feel like spaghetti, where “your people” are in disparate pockets, not your own home. No wonder then that in mid-March, with lockdown looming, a quarter of a million people fled London knowing that without people and places and things, little would be left.They were right then, and continue to be. In the month since “Super Saturday”, when restaurants, pubs and hairdressers were allowed to reopen, the capital has felt flat flatter, perhaps, in the knowledge that more of life as we knew it is back with us, but people are no longer interested. Restaurants usually booked out months ahead lie half empty on Saturday nights Soho is deserted, ditto Camden, Victoria, take your pick – we have gone from sardines to tumbleweed. It’s unsettling and deeply sad, to see hubs (of which the capital is just one) turned – financially, culturally, socially – to dust.The Government is worried about the effects of our continued staying home – economically speaking, at least. But while initiatives like Eat Out to Help Out are welcome, restaurants showing signs of life on Monday and Wednesday for one month of the year is simply not enough. Lockdown taught us to trade full social calendars for empty ones now, instead of reasoning why you would stay in, the question is why would you go out? There have been so many rules and so many changes the first three months in which nothing whatsoever was allowed were surely easier, or less prone to causing headaches over what configuration of social activity won’t get you in trouble.The adage goes that it takes 12 weeks – or the length of the first portion of our lockdown – for habits to become ingrained. Either way, they have. And £10 off dinner on a Monday night won’t be enough to change that.Soothing national malaise is currently a global conundrum. And so it has fallen to Caesar McCool, “the no drama llama”, to calm strife in Portland, Oregon, which is edging towards its 70th day of protests over police brutality. Whether a retired six-year-old Argentine champion camelid can resolve institutionalised racism is anyone’s guess, but the 350lb emotional support animal (who resides at the Mystic Llama Farm, obviously) has been a source of solace in recent months, offering hugs to protesters and photos for fans, of whom there are now more than 10,000 on Instagram.“There’s a lightness in the air when he’s around, and that’s what people especially need right now,” one explained. Nobody was expecting a pandemic, certainly, but a llamactivist? This year has had its share of twists, if nothing else.There is some optimism this side of the Atlantic, too – at least for one couple, who described their engagement via candlelit proposal as “an unforgettable day.” In spite of the fact it burned their Sheffield flat down. All credit to Albert Ndreu for his efforts – a surprise of 100 tea lights spelling out “Marry me?” and 60 balloons secretly adorning their studio – a drama elevated (and later fumigated) when his partner returned to plumes of black smoke coming from the front door. Three fire crews were called the couple are now living with Mr Ndreu’s cousin.Not the most auspicious start for the future, a cynic might think. But – assuming it’s not the fumes talking – surmising the event that turned their home into an ashtray as the “most beautiful” day of their lives is a kind of positivity worthy of admiration.

This has also given us more time to make it even more exciting and more fun than it would have been. So I choose to see it as the glass is half-full that it got postponed.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Or do the things you dreamed of doing in your retirement, that you didn’t have time to do when you were younger. Not just being a cabbage taking antidepressants,\u0027 says\u0026nbspPauline HinderThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The lives of women hit by the state pension age rise have been turned upside down by the coronavirus pandemic, pushing some into destitution after losing their job in the wake of the public health crisis while others have been forced to carry on working – despite their age putting them at risk of serious complications from the life-threatening disease.Almost four million women were affected by the government raising the state pension age from 60 to 66 for women born after March 1950. The age rise was accelerated in 2010 and saw women reach equality with men, at 65, in 2018.BackTo60, a campaign group calling for women to be reimbursed for pension payments they have missed due to the changes, lost its landmark High Court battle after taking the government to court but appealed the ruling last month. Campaigners could now potentially have to wait until the autumn for a decision to be announced.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent spoke to women around the UK who have been affected by the controversial changes to the state pension age who feel they are too old to be working despite the government telling them they are too young to retire.Retired women owed millions in underpaid state pensionJanet Williams, who is from South Wales, said she was shocked to find out the state pension age was rising after her neighbour’s daughter told her over the garden fence.The 62-year-old, who has worked with adults with learning disabilities for 20 years, said her anxiety has spiralled out of control during the coronavirus crisis as she is caring for her husband and her mother – who are both at severe risk from Covid-19.She said: “My husband is 69. He’s type two diabetic and he injects insulin. My mother is 93 in two weeks. She has age-related dementia. I am keeping two houses going. Hers and ours. Both mum and my husband are vulnerable. I’ve got arthritis and I suffer from vertigo. “The week leading up to lockdown, I had severe anxiety about contracting coronavirus. Someone at work had suspected coronavirus. I had a meltdown. I went off sick with anxiety and stress. I am currently on sick pay from my company but that drops down to half pay after six months and it will go down soon. They are trying to make me go to a care home rather than working with people with learning disabilities.“I don’t want to do it. I’m worried about my mother and worried about my husband. They’ve had coronavirus at the care homes near me. Care homes are a very dangerous place at the moment. I started work at 16 and I have worked now for 46 years. I’ve never had a break from work. I always thought I’d retire at 60. I’m so stressed. I’m sleeping about four hours a night if I’m lucky, and when I do go to sleep I’m having nightmares about being made to go to work. It makes me feel like crying.”All you need to know about the appeal over women’s state pension ageNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have no job, no home. I’m just a pensioner without a pension because it was stolen in the name of an equality that doesn’t exist. Equality is precious so its an insult to have this word corrupted in order to cover up the theft of women’s pensions.“Ask my partner of 40 years, if he feels equal now, after watching her partner have nearing £40,000 stolen off her at the most vulnerable time of her life. I spend a lot of time crying. It might sound weird but it’s like I don’t exist. I am a subclass. I tend to get up at 3am and 5am some nights because I can’t sleep. I wake up in the morning and ‘wonder why do you bother?’ I’ve never been like this before. I’ve always been a happy positive person. I don’t believe in anything anymore. “I cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel. I’ve come very close to killing myself. But having my children stops me. It is depressing when you have no existence anymore. When you are disconnected with everything around you. You have no pension, no job, no home, no future and a past that believed in a pension that was a lie. I’m too young, according to the government, to retire and too old to work. I’m trapped between a rock and a hard place.”Surge in women claiming universal credit and out of work benefitsMichaela Hawkins, from South Wales, said she had no official notice from the Department for Work and Pensions the state pension age was being hiked up and only heard through colleagues. The 65-year-old, who previously worked with adults with learning disabilities but has been delivering food to elderly people who are vulnerable during the pandemic, said she had suffered ageism and felt like she was far too old to be working. She said: “I have feared catching coronavirus while working and then coming home and giving it to my husband. They wanted to redeploy me into care homes but my husband is shielding for health reasons. I said no because of that and because of my age as well. I am definitely too old to be working. Working with adults with learning disabilities is an amazing job but it exhausts you physically and mentally. Coronavirus and food banks: The stories behind the statistics“I’ve always been a fit and energetic person. But younger workers working with people with disabilities have said: ‘Isn’t it time you retire? Aren’t you too old to do this kind of job?’ My husband is 11 years older than me and I have caring responsibilities for him. We were looking forward to retiring.“We have had five years stolen from us. We would have liked to have done things together. The main thing was to spend quality time together. Our ambition was to go to the Norwegian fjords. When you come home from work, you are so tired, so weekends are taken up doing things you weren’t able to do as you were so tired. My husband says: ‘Why don’t you give up work? I say: ‘How will we live?”Stephanie Stus, who lives in Worcestershire, said she was only given 16 months notice that her state pension age was going up by six years.The 65-year-old, who works for the NHS via an agency as an ultra-sound practitioner, said she lost her job during the coronavirus crisis with “a minute’s notice” but fortunately has been able to keep one of her jobs.Ms Stus added: “I worked in two different hospitals until 23 March when one hospital let me go. I tried to claim furlough but they don’t do it for the NHS. They assumed people would be redeployed. I can’t claim universal credit because at my age I do have savings. I have just put my house on the market because I can’t afford the mortgage anymore. I’m looking at the for sale board now.“I am struggling to get other work. I’ve applied for jobs. The other hospital did a risk assessment which said I was high risk. They said I couldn’t work with coronavirus patients. You start to feel like you are too old to be working in a pandemic. As more information became apparent, I was worried about contracting coronavirus. The stats show women over 60 are at a substantially higher risk. Of course, it makes you feel more vulnerable.“You are now told because you are 60, you are high risk for coronavirus, but you have to work until you’re 67. There were issues with the state pension age rise before we entered into a global pandemic but now they have been compounded. Of course of the youngsters need work but if you’re a woman who’s lost her state pension without notice and no time to prepare you also need to work.”Pauline Hinder, who is from the west country, said she has not worked for the past few years due to her employer forcing her to retire on health grounds back in 2017.The 64-year-old former civil servant, who is recovering from two types of cancer, said she was now claiming disability benefits due to being too unwell to work but wishes she had her state pension to rely on instead.She said: “I had cancer in 2013 and then a different one in 2014. I can’t work because of the side effects from the last cancer I’ve had. I sometimes have incontinence issues because I’ve had major surgery.“It is a fact of life that as you get older, you get less well. If you are a class of people who is less rich and less wealthy, all of your social and living conditions are going to be lower and your life expectancy is going to be lower and illness probability is going to be higher. Ageism is also a big problem. This country in the 21st century is discriminatory against women and even more so against older women.“I don’t have children. I don’t have a partner. I am on antidepressants. If you had a decent pension, like Germany or France, then you could have a holiday. Or do the things you dreamed of doing in your retirement, that you didn’t have time to do when you were younger. Not just being a cabbage taking antidepressants. The government seems to ignore quality of life unless it’s for the wealthy. There is a growing disparity between the wealthy and the poor. I’ve got royals ten miles away from me.”*Miriam Jones’ name has been changed to protect her identity Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Baroness Lawrence, Sir Keir Starmer’s race relations adviser, pointed to new analysis by Labour which suggests that inner city areas with much higher than average black, Asian and minority ethnic populations have among the highest rates of furloughed staff. Workers in these areas could be at a higher risk of redundancy later this year, the party warns. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData from the House of Commons library shows that nine of the sixteen parliamentary constituencies with the highest take-up rate of the furlough scheme also have much higher than average black, Asian and minority ethnic populations.  They include Tottenham, in London, where the figures show half of the population is from a Bame community and 39 per cent of those eligible have been furloughed. Baroness Lawrence said: “This pandemic has already had a disproportionate impact on the health of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in this country, and now there is mounting evidence that they will be hit hardest by the economic impact too. “The government must support black, Asian and ethnic minority communities by introducing a targeted extension of the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit sectors. “If we are going to effectively address the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 we must eradicate the systemic inequalities that it thrives on.”  In April Sir Keir appointed Baroness Lawrence as his race relations adviser and asked her to lead a review into the effect of the coronavirus on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. The Labour peer, whose son Stephen Lawrence was killed as he waited at a bus stop in 1993, is expected to publish her report later this year.

England coronavirus R rate could be above 1, government warnsManchester police vow to get tough on lockdown breakers Young women ‘most likely to suffer depression and anxiety in lockdown’Preston facing new coronavirus lockdown as infections surgeLuton mayor resigns after breaking lockdown rules at garden partyThe lockdowns will not be lifted until next Friday at the earliest. Making the announcements, health secretary Matt Hancock said: “The past week has been difficult for many people in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and East Lancashire, and I thank everyone in these areas for their patience and willingness to follow the rules.”He said official data did not yet show a decrease in the transmission of the virus, meaning ministers had no choice but to keep the current restrictions in place “to allow more time for the impact of this ban on indoor gatherings to be felt”. The extension of the measures to Preston was “at the request of the local area”, he added. “We are constantly examining the data on the prevalence of the virus in these areas, and we will review the measures again next week.“As we continue to see rising rates of the virus across Europe, it is vital we take every precaution to protect our country. I urge everyone in these areas to follow the rules, get yourself a free test as soon as you get any symptoms, and isolate if NHS Test and Trace tells you to.”The Lancashire Resilience Forum said: “Since the rise of cases was first announced last week, residents, communities and businesses have been asked to take extra precautions to reduce the spread of the virus.“These extra precautions are now mandatory and residents are still actively encouraged to get tested at the regional testing site based at Preston’s College if they are experiencing any symptoms of coronavirus.”There were 61 new cases in Preston in the week\u0026nbspto 4 August, the equivalent of 42.6 cases per 100,000 people – up from 21.7 per 100,000 in the previous seven days.Earlier, the Office for National Statistics\u0026nbspsaid that while national\u0026nbspfigures had suggested the percentage of those\u0026nbsptesting positive for Covid-19 had risen since the end of June, there was\u0026nbspnow evidence to suggest that trend may have levelled off.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While none of those named in the report have disputed the veracity of the messages, some have said that claims made in the report are false. The leaked internal communications also show officials warning to keep certain activities, including the direction of some campaigning resources, secret from the leadership and its allies or any other officials they deemed to be too left wing.“Many of us experienced the daily hostility and obstruction towards Jeremy, his office and members of the shadow cabinet and the frequent leaking and hostile briefing to the media,” the statement says, adding that “some of us will provide examples of these in our inidual submissions”. In 2016 hostile MPs tried to replace Mr Corbyn as party leader in a so-called “coup”, but he was re-elected with a bigger majority in a second leadership contest.Keir Starmer commissioned lawyer Martin Forde QC to lead an inquiry into the leaked document after it came to light, to look into its contents and how it was leaked. Other than factional hostility, the dossier claimed a “toxic” culture had developed at the party’s head office that included racist, sexist and violent language. It also claimed that factional hostility made it harder to deal with antisemitism in the party.

A separate submission, reported by , from the officials accused of sabotage, alleges that the leaked report misused their private messages to make them seem racist and sexist. They are expected to take the Labour Party to court over alleged data protection breaches and libel.One of the former staff members involved described the suggestion by Mr Corbyn\u0027s team as a ridiculous conspiracy theory and an attempt to create a stab in the back myth adding: “The leaked report contains no evidence that party staff did not try and do the best they could to win the 2017 election. Not one piece of actual evidence.However, one election night chat log included in the leaked report showed that 45 minutes after the exit poll revealed that Labour had overturned the Conservative majority, one senior official said the result was the “opposite to what I had been working towards for the last couple of years”.

The party said a previous statement about staffers had “contained defamatory and false allegations”.Labour won 40 per cent of the vote in 2017, unexpectedly costing Theresa May her majority in parliament and increasing the party’s vote share from 30 per cent in 2015. In 2019, riven by splits over a possible second referendum and allegations of antisemitism, the party fell to 32 per cent and lost swathes of seats, particularly in the Midlands and north of England. The 2019 result was the worst in terms of MPs elected since 1935, though Labour’s second highest vote share since 2005.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.More cash will go to schools “in leafy suburbs” than in poorer areas under new funding rules, a government minister has admitted.Nick Gibb accepted a highly-critical analysis by the Education Policy Institute (EPI), which found that next year’s spending boost would favour schools in affluent parts.The schools minister defended the decision on the basis that it was correcting “historic underfunding” in some areas outside of England’s big cities.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, asked about the winners, when an extra £7.1bn is handed out over four years, he acknowledged: “They may well be in leafy suburbs.”The aim was to “level up funding”, to ensure every primary school received at least £4,000 per pupil, with a £5,150-per-head floor in secondaries.Migrants \u0027at risk of drowning\u0027 if Navy sent to block boats in Channel“That does mean that the historically underfunded schools are getting a larger increase than the schools that have been well funded in the past,” Mr Gibb told BBC Radio 4.The admission came as the minister promised “hygiene rules” on new buses to be introduced to help with the full return to schools in the autumn.Pupils over 11 years of age would be expected to wear masks, he said, even though they would not be required to do that when they reach their classrooms.Other measures such as pupil ‘bubbles’, increased hand hygiene and staggered lunch breaks would be in place to keep pupils distanced and in school buildings.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Emergency services make their way along the seafront on Bournemouth beach in Dorset on one of the hottest days of the yearAlison Murphy poses for a picture by husband Peter as she walks through a field of sunflowers in Altrincham, CheshirePakistan\u0027s Abid Ali being bowled by England\u0027s Jofra Archer during day one of the First Test match at the Emirates Old Trafford, ManchesterThe \u0027Timbuktu tumblers\u0027 from Kenya perform their balancing act on the Southsea waterfront as Zippos Circus reopens in PortsmouthPelicans interact with a visitor in St James\u0027s Park in LondonLewis Hamilton drives with a puncture towards the finish line to win the Formula One British Grand Prix at Silverstone Arsenal\u0027s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates with the trophy and teammates after winning the FA Cup, as play resumes behind closed doors following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease People enjoy the sunny weather at a Bournemouth BeachAn artist puts the finishing touches to a wax figure of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in the entrance line at Madame Tussaud\u0027s in London, as the attraction prepares to reopen to the public following the easing of lockdown restrictions in EnglandA member of staff stands on Ai Weiwei\u0027s \u0027History of Bombs\u0027 during a photocall for the Chinese artist\u0027s new work on display at the Imperial War Museum in LondonStuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Kraigg Brathwaite.

That title, instead, belongs to the neighbourhood of Gemmayze. In Gemmayze, there is life. Or at least there was. On Tuesday, more than 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate being held in a warehouse in Beirut’s port exploded and sent shock waves through the city. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt least 145 people died and 300,000 were made homeless. Gemmayze, a mile-long corridor that stretches east from downtown, lay right in the path of the destruction – less than 800 metres from the site of the blast. To look at what was destroyed in Gemmayze is to go some way to understanding what Beirut has lost: Not only lives, family members, friends, but part of the soul of the city. Homes, bars, restaurants, art galleries, livelihoods and historic buildings, all gone in an instant. “Gemmayze is freedom. Whatever you wanna wear, whatever you wanna say, whoever you wanna kiss, whatever you wanna do. It’s a beautiful place. That’s why I chose it,” says 33-year-old Hala Okeili, who lives and works in the neighbourhood. Okeili was driving towards her home when the explosion struck. Her whole life was there: her husband, her home, her business, her husband’s business. Her partner survived, the rest did not. “I arrived and everything was destroyed,” she says. “People bleeding. Our neighbours, faces I recognised. Young people bleeding from every single part of their bodies.”Okeili’s story, like the neighbourhood in which she lived, is one of hope and renewal, and now loss. She is like so many young Lebanese who had the education and means to do anything, go anywhere, but chose instead to pour their hearts into Beirut, their home. After this explosion, we don’t have any dreams. We don’t have any feelings. We can’t do anything. We are like visitors in our countryAfter training as a lawyer in France and working as a corporate lawyer for eight years, Okeili quit the profession to open a yoga studio in the centre of the neighbourhood in 2016. Sarvam Yoga was busy and thriving. So too was the coffee shop started by her husband, Omar, just down the road. Omar wanted to cater to a new generation of coffee connoisseurs and brought beans to Lebanon from around the world. “We had the choice to leave but we chose to stay and make a change,” says Okeili. “I’m a lawyer, I quit my job. I said to myself I want to open a yoga studio because people here need it. They need that piece of mind.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Building a business from the ground up anywhere in the world requires a special kind of bravery. In Lebanon, with all its dysfunction and corruption, it is the pursuit of pioneers. Gemmayze was full of pioneers. Restaurants were opening all the time – young Lebanese who had travelled and brought back cuisine from around the world. Art galleries, new bars with speciality cocktails. It was a testing ground for entrepreneurs and dreamers – as daring and erse as any New York street. In the evenings, Gouraud Street, which runs through the centre of the neighbourhood, was an intoxicating buzz of people spilling out of bars and onto the street. Often it wasn’t clear where the pavement ended and the road began. Steep steps, painted in bright colours, lead off from the main road up the hill. In the summer, they play host to concerts and outdoor film festivals. Mixed in among the gleaming, hopeful shop fronts were the remnants of the city’s gloried past. Stunning Ottoman-era mansions with balconies that hung over the street. Ornate townhouses with large windows from the French mandate, when the city earned the nickname “the Paris of the Middle East”. Some of these homes had been in the same families for generations. Elderly, working-class grandparents lived alongside young professionals. Okeili lived in one of those houses. A 300-year-old building just off the main street, which was destroyed. In the past two days, strangers have been helping her pull her belongings out from the shaky structure. Many of them are too damaged to be repaired. “We’re ashamed to talk about the materialistic losses, because a lot of people died. We know some who died,” she says. “But it’s a beautiful place. All the heritage, all the beautiful buildings are gone. We know they will just destroy them because no one is there to fix it. Gemmayze as we know it will no longer be the same.”Heba Kanso, who has lived in Gemmayze for three years, was out of the country when she received a call from her cousin on the day of the explosion. “He kept repeating ‘everything is gone, everything is gone.’ I was in shock,” the 33-year-old says. After checking in with her family to make sure they were safe, she started to run through a list of all the places in the neighbourhood she visited every day that would no longer be there anymore, and the people who might be hurt.  “I can go down my list but there is simply too much destruction and too many people hurt by this,” she says. “I realised that this area will be forever changed, including my home which was destroyed. Every single building is damaged and so much incredible historic architecture is destroyed.”Gemmayze felt like any street in a cosmopolitan city, but it had a distinct neighbourhood feel. Everyone knows each other. It had characters. In the centre of it all stood Le Chef, a decades-old restaurant serving Lebanese fare. The no-frills restaurant would fill up every night with locals and foreign visitors alike. Anyone who passed by the store would be beckoned by the booming voice of head chef Charbel Bassil: “Welcome, welcome,” he shouted, as he attempted to draw them into the brightly lit cafe. Bassil was in his restaurant when the explosion shattered the windows to Le Chef. He was injured, along with two of his staff and a customer. “We saw hell on earth,” he says, “but we thank God that we’re alive.”Now recovering at home, Bassil is not sure if, or how, he will reopen. Okeili feels the same. Like many others, she doesn’t trust Lebanon’s leaders enough to put her efforts into rebuilding all over again. Even before the explosion, Lebanon was teetering on the edge – its economy ruined by years of corruption by the country’s political class.  “They’ve taken everything away from us. Our money, our dreams, even our buildings – our souls. And we keep on fighting,” she says.  But this explosion may be the final straw. “The people of this country deserve a better life. They are creative, talented, resilient, they are happy people, full of life and love,” she says.“In one year we lost all our savings, our house, our business. I almost lost my husband. What more can I lose? If there’s no miracle my plan might be to leave. I don’t have the energy anymore. I might lose this again and again.”Bassil and Okeili, Beirut’s past and future, symbols of its hope and resilience, are now devoid of both.

They said: “Measures must be taken on a borough-by-borough basis and on a town-by-town basis in boroughs where there are only one or two coronavirus hotspots but the rates in other parts of the borough are low.”The threat of more local lockdown comes as the Government prepares to reopen schools for all pupils in September - and a major study warned this week that this could cause a second wave of Covid-the Test  Trace system isnt up to scratch.Many of the local areas seeing spikes have implemented their own contact tracing systems, relying on local knowledge of the area, after the national service failed to pick up enough contacts.

The dficulty is usually in finding the traces in the first place.Just last week, German authorities examined an underground tunnel as they continue to investigate suspect Christian B as the new prime suspect in Maddies disappearance.The -year-old sex offender had been in Praia de Luz at the time of Maddies disappearance.And he was this year named as German police announced a major breakthrough in the decades old case - claiming they had concrete evidence that Madeleine was dead.As part of the investigation, it is hoped a tiny scrap of blue material held in the vaults of a Portuguese forensic lab could provide the vital link between Christian B and Madeleine. Tests uncovered a microscopic a DNA profile initially identied as semen, but later confirmed to be saliva.Scientists were unable to obtain a full DNA profile at the time but have continued to work on it with new testing techniques.Authorities now hope that continuing advances in DNA testing may yet provide a full profile for comparison with the convicted paedophile and rapist.Portuguese cops had launched an initial search when the little girl vanished in , with the politan Police then taking on the probe to find Maddie in . So far, more than£. million has been spent on the investigation.The case has drawn worldwide attention, with Madeleines own parents even accused over her disappearance as theories over what happened to the three-year-old abounded.But despite the sometimes grim nature of forensic work, Prof Gallop has remained motivated.She said: “People’s freedom, and often their sense of justice is at stake.“Also family feelings andthey have lost a loved one – there is the need to provide proper closureat all possible.“All of these things you are well aware of, and I think it just drives you to do as well as you possibly can.“Stick at it and be as careful, innovative and accurate as you can – that’s what keeps you going.”But she is also quick to point out it hasn’t just been her but a team of scientists who have helped solve these cold cases.It was in  that her team managed to piece together what happened to Rachel Nickell, a -year-old woman who was murdered on Wimbledon Common, in South-West London in .Thanks to Prof Gallop’s team, a tiny trace of DNA that had previously been missed was found, leading to the conviction of Robert Napper  years after Rachel’s death.In another investigation with staggering attention to detail, Prof Gallop and her team found a tiny blood stain on the shorts of John Cooper.The blood belonged to Peter Dixon, who had been killed alongside his Gwenda Dixon in Pembrokeshire in .Cooper was ultimately given a whole le order for the  double murder of siblings Richard and Helen Thomas along with the Dixons in .It is this fastidiousness to detail and objectivity in investigating that Prof Gallop is keen to pass on.Due to cuts around police funding, more forensic investigations are being done in house.Prof Gallop said: “I’m just left wonderingthis is appropriate.By her own admission, she wasn’t that interested in school and struggled towards the end of her university about what she was going to spend her le doing.Then one day a friend showed her an advertisement in the paper to work in forensic science.She said: “I realised I wanted to do something that involved applied science, as opposed to pure research for example, and that was more immediately important for people in general.“One of my friends came over and said have a look at this ad in the newspaper – is that applied enough for you ”Starting her career working for the Home Office Forensic Science Service in , she has since started her own forensic laboratories and even been awarded a CBE in .So what has kept her going through her career of more than four decades Prof Gallop explained: “I find it fascinating, the whole investigative aspect to it. It’s like peeling an onion and seeing what each layer reveals.“I was pretty awful at school until the last few years but they always used to say I was very tenacious.“If something interested me, I would always stick at it until I really understood it.“That’s been handy to have – that attitude of needing to get to the bottom of things.”And while others may use CSI-type shows and podcasts to relax, Prof Gallop mostly stays away from the recent trend of true crime.She said: “Personally, I can’t watch much of it. Butit provides entertainment for others, that’s fine.“People need to be entertained but I will inevitably get irritated by the inaccuracies and the way things are portrayed. As ever, I think real le is much more interesting.”However, she does admit to having a soft spot for Inspector Morse - as he works around her birthplace of Oxford – and a touch of Agatha Christie.She has written a book herself – When the Dogs Don’t Bark: A Forensic Scientist’s Search for the Truth.In it, Prof Gallop examines the lessons she has learnt over more than  years in science.She added: “We all know these days about cognitive bias where,you are expecting something, you may be more likely to think you’ve found it.“Andyour budget is restricted, and you’ve only been able to do a few tests on one or two items, you’ll only get half the picture and you could draw wholly inappropriate conclusions and end up misleading people.”She added: “I’m also worried that all the lessons we’ve so painstakingly learned about how to solve dficult cases will be lost. It’s all about combining novel approaches to find evidence with new technology to analyse it – not usually one or the other on their own.”And she pointed out how effective forensic science could be when it was used properly.She said: “It has been demonstrated time and time again, that it is so much cheaper to spend slightly more money on forensic science up front than having endless re-investigations and public inquiries.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His page is one of many offering the service on the social media site.One desperate donor posted on his page: “I need some money. I sell my one kidney plz help.”Undercover Sun reporters messaged Mutalib’s page saying we had a relative in Britain who needed a transplant.We met the -year-old father of four at a hotel in Kuching, Malaysia, not far from his home.In tinted glasses and dark striped polo shirt, he was soon bragging about his illicit trade.He then casually sketched out a bespoke package for our “relative’s” transplant.His fee would be , dollars for supplying the kidney — all payable to Mutalib. Then , dollars for the clinic — half to the hospital and half to Mutalib so “we do some under-table thing”.Rules banning transplant ops between donors and recipients who aren’t friends or relations would be got round with bribes and forged papers, he explained.He eventually dropped his donor fee to mean the total cost would be £,.The following day we met Mutalib again and on speakerphone he contacted first a destitute Turkish man who wanted to sell his kidney for cash and then a Malaysian woman.Beginning on the dark web, Mutalib says he has been hawking organs since  and began using Facebook two years ago. He first centred his operation in China, which has been accused of organ harvesting on an industrial scale with body parts being taken from the Uighur minority and followers of banned spiritual movement Falun Gong. The broker says China would ask patients to leave the country within a fortnight to “dispose of the evidence”, even though the “cut is not healing yet”.He ceased his China operations and developed contacts in the Philippines, which has a reputation as one of the global hotspots for organ trafficking.The broker boasts he now has a “surplus” of potential kidney sellers in India, Africa, South America and across Asia on his books.He said five Britons had contacted him on Facebook offering to sell their kidneys. One wanted £, and another £,. Mutalib said it was too much cash.The broker says he has also been contacted by a Brit needing a transplant but negotiations ended.Organ trading is illegal in Malaysia while under Philippine law human trafficking for organs could land Mutalib  years in prison.The smiling fixer is well aware of the risks.He added: “I’m doing a risky job dealing with the kidney buyer and seller. When you get caught, it’s years in jail.” Just under  Brits received follow-up support after a transplant abroad between  and . Some of the ops are legal.But the true number of Brit transplant tourists is likely to be far higher, as brokers tell their patients not to let the NHS know what they have done.In  the Salvation Army rescued a woman brought to Britain to have her organs harvested.In May the Government introduced an “opt-out” scheme in England for organ donation. It means when you die your organs will automatically be considered for donation unless you have stated otherwise. The NHS hopes it will lead to  more organ transplants each year by .But the coronavirus pandemic has seen the number of transplant ops in the UK plummet after a fall in violent crime and car accidents.Data from NHS Blood and Transplant shows only  transplant ops were carried out between April  and May  of this year, compared with  in the same period in .A Department of Health spokesman said: “Organ transplants should only be carried out by the NHS or a veried provider.”A Facebook spokesman told The Sun last night: “We do not allow the sale of body organs on Facebook and we have removed the page brought to our attention.”The Sun has passed information on Mutalib to Britain’s National Crime Agency.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nothing.Their decision to put it there in the middle of a city of two million people was an utter disaster.

Some schools will be doing this twice a week and some may close at an earlier time on all five days. Head teachers claim schools need to close early so staff can carry out the extra safety measures caused by the pandemic, including more time for deep cleaning, Mail Online reports.One teacher has died from the virus in the UK - and they didnt pick it up from school, according to papers from the Government advisory group Sage.The average number of confirmed Covid- cases among children is close to zero and its believed no child has needed hospital treatment since the beginning of June.Three teachers needed hospital care over the same period.Several schools will reportedly send their children home early at least one afternoon a week so teachers can plan lessons and mark work.Teachers would do their marking while a teaching assistant would take over the class, but schools say this is dficult as teachers and students remain in a bubble.Its feared that children will miss out on more education after already losing almost half a year of schooling because of lockdown. Primary schools and nurseries began to reopen on June  for children in reception, Years  and  and in nursery. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced the Governments intention to send all pupils back to school for the start of the new academic year.Early finishes will also be an inconvenience to parents who are planning toto normal work routines by the autumn. Teachers are entitled to an amount of planning, preparation and assessment time during the school week, said Geoff Barton, of the Association of School and College Leaders.The need to keep pupils and adults apart in consistent bubbles may make this harder, and some schools may decide to close earlier than one day a week. Its an example of the dilemma facing schools in the autumn, he said.Shorter school days adds an extra layer of confusion for parents after teaching unions warned that many establishments wont open their doors in September. Dr Mary Bousted, joint head of the National Education Union, said that many schools would find opening their doors to pupils impossible, despite six months out of education for some kids.In a recorded Zoom meeting seen by the Daily , Dr Bousted told members they cant trust the Government advice and local areas should make their own rules.She said: “The latest iteration of government guidance is so unworkable that you cant trust it. Local authorities and schools should take the confidence to do what they can do and that will mean for many schools that they cannot have all children fully back in September.“Now, the Governments making threatening noises about that. But in the end, they wont be able to carry out their threats.” Nine out of ten parents back the full reopening of schools next month. The Office for National Statistics found  per cent of parents were likely or fairly likely to send their kid back to class.The Department for Education said that getting all kids back into the classroom was a national priority.One source said: “There is absolutely no reason for schools to stay closed. The guidelines are in place for a safe , the latest polls show  per cent of parents are in favour of schools going back in full, and Labour also support a fullof schools.”But, Professor Neil Ferguson warned that secondary schools might have to go back part time as new science shows teens spread the virus as much as adults. Professor Chris Whitty warned last week that England may have reached the limits of what it can safely reopen without a spike in cases.

Pressure was growing on the Prime Minister’s chief aide to provide evidence of the claims which he made in the garden of No  after the Mirror revealed his first -mile lockdown trip to his parents. Mr Cummings has categorically denied that he was in Houghall Woods near their Durham home on the morning of Sunday April . But walkers Dave and Clare Edwards told police in a statement that they were ‘ certain’ that they had seen him. They have gone to the Independent Office for Police Conductabout how their report of the sighting was handled. Former chief constable Mike Barton, in charge when Durham was recognised as the best force in the country, told the Mirror: “It is the classic formula. Eventually the police get blamed. “If Mr Cummings has proof that he did not go to Durham on that day - then let’s just see it.” His former colleagues at Durham must now decide whether to approach Mr Cummings for a statement on the latest claims, or ask him to produce his evidence of his whereabouts that day. It is understood that the force took the advice of a top QC before releasing their statement after Mr Cummings’ now infamous trip to Barnard Castle to ‘test his eyesight’. Durham Police decided that he may have committed a “minor breach” of the rules on April  - his we’s birthday - but that no further action would be taken.  A spokeswoman for the IOPC said: “In accordance with the police complaints procedure, we have forwarded a complaint to Durham Constabulary. “It will now be a matter for the force to determine the next steps including whether this complaint merits referral to the IOPC.”Their statement came amid growing pressure on Boris Johnson to make public the evidence provided by his chief advisor about April .Dave and Clare, both , are not alone in thinking that Mr Cummings was in Houghall Woods on that day.  The joint Mirror andinvestigation has now tracked down four people who have reported sightings of him that morning. The first man got in touch with the Mirror after spotting him with a female companion in the area at around .am. Dave, who works in manufacturing, and Clare, a nurse and care home worker for  years, believe that they spotted him there with a group of people just after am. The fourth witness told us how he left his home at precisely .am on April  and was in the woods by around . to .am. He had not come forward before he spoke to the Mirror. He said: “I heard on the grapevine that he had been seen in the area of the woods before April . “It had been spoken about by people who had spotted him in the area. I left my house at .am on April .  “It was quite a warm day so it would have taken around  minutes to get there, I think that I saw him around .-.am. “It was on the section going down towards the Botanical Gardens, towards Houghall Farm in the area at the back of Houghall Agricultural college.“At first I could not quite believe that I had seen him. I thought ‘why would he be up here ’ But I was sure about it at the time.”Clare, , is “% certain” in her claims that she saw Mr Cummings. She added: “It would be great to seehe could produce anything.“I just want the truth to be out there.” A further witness told thethey saw Cummings back in north London, on Hampstead Heath, later the same afternoon. Mr Cummings has described accusations that he made a second lockdown trip to the North East as “”. That denial came after we revealed in May that he drove  miles with his we Mary Wakefield, who had Covid- symptoms, and son to self isolate at his parents’ home near Durham on March , at the height of the lockdown.  During their two-week stay, the family went to Barnard Castle,  miles away, which he later claimed was to test his eyesight before the next day’s drive to London. A No spokesman said that Durham Constabulary had made clear that ‘they are not taking further action against Mr Cummings’ and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations. “The Prime Minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed,” they added. Durham Constabulary said: “As outlined in our statement of May , we carried out an investigation into this matter led by a senior detective and found insufficient evidence to support the allegation.” But questions were asked about the PM’s decision to back Mr Cummings after it had been revealed he broke the Government’s rules, prompting public outcry and damaging confidence in lockdown restrictions. In his Downing Street garden press conference, Mr Cummings told reporters: “There is a particular report that I ed there on April th. Photos and data on my phone prove this to be .

Sir Bernard, Mrs Thatcher’s spin doctor for most of her  years in office, said Whitehall was “demoralised” by the way senior mandarins had been removed at Mr Cummings’s behest, because he regarded them as either “not up to it” or not sufficiently pro-Brexit. Writing in the Yorkshire Post, Sir Bernard said “At its [the Government’s] heart is the malevolent presence of Dominic Cummings, the PM’s principal adviser, who thinks the Civil Service is pretty useless and the machine would be better in the hands of weirdos like himself.”He added: “It is not hindsight to say that a certain humility was required at the outset of a pandemic caused by a new virus with still no antidote. “Yet, while the uncertainties have been implicit in the ‘following the science’ mantra, ministers have tended to convey a certain command instead of admitting they are learning as they go along.

Our front page today reports the account of witnesses who believe they saw the PMaposs top aide near Durham on the morning April .That is almost a week after he ed to London. Yet Mr Cummings categorically denies he made a second trip up north, and says he has evidence to prove it. Todayaposs story has come to light after two of the alleged witnesses, Clare Edwards, , and her husband Dave, complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Clare believes her allegation that she saw Mr Cummings on April  was not taken seriously enough by officers. Given itaposs months now since the original story, it can be hard to grasp what this all means, and why it matters. So here is an explainer.What did Dominic Cummings do  The Tory adviser drove  miles with his we, who had Covid- symptoms, and son to self-isolate at his family farm near Durham on March  at the height of the lockdown. The next morning Mr Cummings himself fell ill, and the family proceeded to stay for two weeks, including a night when his son ended up in hospital, although he tested negative. During their stay, the family went to Barnard Castle,  miles away, on April , which Mr Cummings later claimed was to test his eyesight before the drive to London the next day. Mr Cummings admitted the trip but claimed he had not broken the rules. That is despite the rules at the time clearly banning non-essential travel, or leaving your home at allyou or a member of your household had symptoms. He claimed he was exempt from these rules because he needed to seek childcare for his son, in case he fell too ill to care for him. But he admitted he did not, in the end, need childcare. He ed to London on April .  What did police do  Durham Police investigated, and concluded on May  that there might have been a minor breach of the Regulations that would have warranted police intervention. However, the force added: Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing. Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings toto the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken. They also took witness statements and a photograph from the Edwardses on May , after being contacted by the couple. In their statement on May  they concluded there was insufficient evidence to investigate further.  What are new witnesses saying  A man got in touch with the Mirror on April , claiming he saw Mr Cummings with a female companion in Houghall Woods at . that morning. But in a press conference in the No garden in May, Mr Cummings denied this claim – saying: Photos and data on my phone prove this to be . Since then, three other people who claim to have seen Mr Cummings on April  have come forward.Clare Edwards, , said she is “% certain” she saw Boris Johnson ’s chief adviser while walking in Houghall Woods near Durham on the morning of Sunday, April . Her husband Dave claims to have seen Mr Cummings too. Clare and Dave have now comp­lained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, claiming Durham police did not properly investigate their allegations about Mr Cummings. Another new witness claims to have seen Mr Cummings and a female companion walking between the beauty spot and the family home that morning between . and .. Another person then said they think they saw Mr Cummings on Hampstead Heath in North London that afternoon, four hours later at .pm. A test-drive of the route on a quiet Sunday after lockdown took three hours and  minutes.  How is this dferent to what we knew already  It is all about the date. The people who have spoken to the Mirror believe they saw Mr Cummings near Durham on April . That is almost a week after Mr Cummings ed to London from his two-week stay with his family. If Mr Cummings was in Durham on the morning of April , which he has previously denied, it would mean he made a second trip during lockdown. And that he misled both the PM - who spent six hours discussing the matter with him - and the public.  Why does it matter  Firstly, Dominic Cummings categorically denied that he had made a second trip to Durham during lockdown. So the claims suggest that either the witnesses were mistaken, or that Mr Cummings did make a second trip but said otherwise. Secondly, Mr Cummings said he had evidence to prove he did not make a second trip to Durham. Boris Johnson also suggested he had seen this evidence, saying:it pleases you I will say yes, I did. So the new claims add pressure on Mr Cummings or Downing Street to say what this evidence was. Thirdly, Mr Cummings gave a detailed -controversial - reasoning for travelling up north at the end of March. If he had travelled up north a second time, which he denies, this reasoning would be discredited. And fourthly, the law still banned leaving oneaposs home without reasonable excuse on April . A second trip would raise questions about whether this was followed.  What happens now  Labour have now demanded Dominic Cummings produce the evidence to prove he did not make a second trip to the north east during lockdown.Deputy leader Angela Rayner said: The public have a right to know whether the Prime Minister’s chief advisor made a second lockdown-breaching trip to Durham, and it is surely therefore only right that this evidence is produced. If Dominic Cummings was in London during both the morning and afternoon of the th April, and not in Durham as has been alleged, I’m sure that he the Prime Minister will welcome this opportunity to set the record straight.Former North West prosecutor Nazir Afzal, whose brother died of coronavirus, has launched his own appeal for evidence after accusing the police forces who investigated the case of ”closing ranks”.He said today: “Mr Cummings stated that he was not in Durham at any time on the th, he and these witnesses cannot both be right. “The failure of the police to investigate remains very disappointing given the public interest and concern.” The Met Police is also coming under pressure to investigate the allegations from, among others, the chair of Londonaposs Police and Crime Committee. But a No spokesman said yesterday: “Durham Constabulary have made clear they are not taking any further action against Mr Cummings and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations. “The Prime Minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed.” Durham Constabulary said: “As outlined in our statement of May , [we] carried out an investigation into this matter led by a senior detective and found insufficient evidence to support the allegation.” Timeline of events Monday  March: Prime Minister Boris Johnson advises everyone in the UK to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.Monday  March: In an evening TV address, the PM announces a UK-wide lockdown - effective immediately - to contain the spread of the virus.

Public gatherings of more than two people, unless from the same household or under an exception, are banned effective immediately. Thursday  March: The lockdown restrictions that the PM launched on  March formally take force in law at pm, with £ fines for first-time offenders who break the rules. The three-day lag is due to the need to pass legislation through Parliament.Friday  March: Dominic Cummings is spotted running out of No to rush home to his we, who is ill with coronavirus symptoms.

Under new guidelines released by the Government, as of Saturday August  the number of places where it is compulsory to wear a face covering has increased. People will need to wear face coverings in cinemas, theatres, museums and places of worship, Yorkshire Live reports. Masks have been mandatory in shops since July  and are required to travel on public transport. But The PM announced he would extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings. Boris Johnson said last week they will be compulsory in indoor settings where people are likely to come into contact with others they do not know. See below for the full list of where face coverings will need to be worn. Speaking at a Downing Street press briefing, Mr Johnson said: We will also extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings where you are likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet, such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship. We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings, and this will become enforceable in law from August . The Prime Minister added: Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their best to control the virus.  But we must keep our discipline and our focus and we cannot be complacent. I have asked the Home Secretary to work with the police and others to ensure the rules which are already in place are properly enforced.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made the remarks during an interview after the couple announced their engagement on November , . After years of dating and endless speculation, Kate, now , and William, also , officially announced they would be getting married. Shortly after, the couple sat down for an interview with journalist Tom Bradby about their relationship. During the interview, Kate was asked by Mr Bradby: You are obviously going to enter this family, the most famous royal family in the world. Williamaposs mother was this massive iconic figure. The most famous figure of our age, is that worrying  Is that intimidating  Do you think about that a lot both of you, you particularly Kate, obviously  Kate replied: Obviously I would have loved to have met her and sheaposs obviously an inspirational woman to look up to. Obviously on this day and you know going forward and things, you know it is a wonderful family, the members who Iaposve met have achieved a lot and you know very inspirational and so, yes, I do. William then added: Thereaposs no pressure though. Thereaposs no pressure, like Kate said it is about carving your own future. No one is going to try to fill my motheraposs shoes, what she did was fantastic. Itaposs about making your own future and your own destiny and Kate will do a very good job of that. The couple, who have since welcomed three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, then revealed details about their engagement, which happened on holiday in Kenya. William said: We had a little private time away together with some friends and I just decided that it was the right time really. We had been talking about marriage for a while so it wasnapost a massively big surprise. I took her up somewhere nice in Kenya and I proposed.  He added: Iaposd been planning it for a while but as every guy out there will know it takes a certain amount of motivation to get yourself going. So I was planning it and then it just felt really right out in Africa. It was beautul at the time. I just … I had done a little bit of planning to show my romantic side. Kate admitted she really didnapost expect it all. It was a total shock when it came, and very excited, she said.  William confirmed he proposed to Kate with his late motheraposs blue sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which he had been carrying around in a rucksack for three weeks. I thought it was quite nice because obviously sheaposs not going to be around to share any of the fun and excitement of it all - this was my way of keeping her sort of close to it all, he said. Itaposs beautul, Kate added. Later in the interview, she was askedshe had been nervous about meeting the Queen.  She said: I first met her at Peter and Autumnaposs wedding and again it was amongst a lot of other guests and she was very friendly and no it was fine. William added: She was very welcoming, she knew it was a big day and everything was going on with Peter and Autumn, she wanted to meet Kate for a while, so it was very nice for her to come over and say hello and have a little chat.  Meanwhile, last month, the Duke of Cambridge revealed the worst ever gt he bought Kate Middleton when they were dating - and sheaposs never let him forget it. William told the Peter Crouch podcast how he almost scuppered his relationship with Kate by buying her a pair of binoculars during one of their first dates.

To fill the time, many people have taken up new hobbies and some families have said their new shared interests have brought them closer together - and they plan to continue them going forward. As the governmentaposs restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey with Very has looked back at how we all spent the strictest months of lockdown and how people view the “new normal”.Both kids and their parents have the opportunity to do new things, with  per cent of mums and dads with teenage kids saying theyaposve tried something for the first time or more often than normal. Cooking and baking is the most popular aposnewapos activity, with  per cent of parents with teenagers and  per cent of people with younger kids surveyed listing it. Gardening and exercise were next up on the list in both groups. Meanwhile, their kids have also enjoyed cooking and baking, at  per cent, while  per cent have tried their hand at gardening. Arts and crafts and growing their own fruit and veg also made the top five.Interestingly, the exclusive Daily Mirror and Very survey showed that gardening was far lower down the list for kids younger than , with exercise in second place after cooking and baking.Boys were more likely to have spent more time playing a musical instrument and doing DIY. And for many, the group activities have brought them together as a family. Describing the positives of lockdown, one parent wrote: Being able to help more with the kids home schooling as normally I am in work. Building a veg garden and growing our own veg has been a fun thing for all of us.  And I feel we have all grown closer as a family. Meanwhile, other families used the opportunity to exercise and to improve their fitness. Some even opted to do this all together, either through group work outs or by making it a competition. One parent said: Getting myself fitter by running more on my treadmill. The rest of family doing it as well, so we are fitter as a family physically and mentally. Some made the most of their one trip out of the house for exercise by going out for a walk with loved ones. One wrote: Going for a walk with my daughter and spotting all the wildle and breathing cleaner air. Another added: Going out for walks and discovering areas around where I live that I never knew were there. While everyone has obviously faced their own challenges in lockdown, some people have found itaposs also brought some advantages, Veryaposs research found. Parents of younger kids are more likely to have found the lockdown fun compared to those with teenage children, but an incredible amount say the restrictions have brought them closer as a family.

The landlord goes on to suggest the shed could be shared between three people - splitting the rent £ each way. In an advert for the garden shed, it describes the property as well kept and an outdoor decking, private entrance and is just a short bus journey away from Highgate station.

The rent includes all bills, wi and free parking.  From images on the advert, it appears tenants have no access to an oven and only the option to cook in a microwave. The landlord says smoking and pets are not allowed.

Bleach and vinegar are routinely used in households to keep bathrooms and kitchens free of dirt and grime. But many people are apparently unaware that combining both some chemicals can create a highly dangerous toxic gas.  Australian consumer advocacy group CHOICE issued the warning to consumers.They said: “Warning: Never mix bleach and vinegar together – it creates toxic chlorine gas.” If you do accidentally mix the products together, you should immediately leave the area and try and breathe in some fresh air. Also change and wash any clothes that have been contaminated. You may notice irritation of your nose, mouth, and throat. Vinegar is often used as a natural compound unlike man-made chemicals such as bleach. While both are lauded for their stain-removing qualities, both together are a lethal combination.Bleach is made of diluted sodium hypochlorite while vinegar is a diluted form of acetic acid, reports OK!

It is not yet certainthe tragedy which killed at least  people on Tuesday was an accident or terrorism. Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun said: “There is a possibility of a rocket or bomb or other act.’“ The blast, which flattened much of Beirut’s port, was caused when a fire set off a ,-ton pile of ammonium nitrate in a warehouse. But shipping company Portico wants permission to store up to , tons in ­Portsmouth, Hants. The firm insists the plan is safe. But there are fears over the risk posed by the chemical, used in ­fertiliser. Terror group Hezbollah has previously threatened to use it as a weapon and MI foiled a plot in London five years ago.Last year Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah claimed he was storing the substance in Haa, Israel, adding: “A few missiles hit the tanks [and] tens ofthousands will be killed.”Haras Rafiq, who has sat on ious government taskforces combating extremism and terrorism, said of Nasrallah’s grim boast: “In that video, he states it wouldn’t take much to turn that stored chemical into deadly bombs.  We certainly need to be more vigilant when looking at Hezbollah and how it operates globally.” Three tons of ammonium nitrate were found in four London properties in . A man in his s was arrested but later released. Meanwhile, Portico defended its ­Portsmouth plan, saying: “These goods are handled on a regular basis in ports and held in larger quantities in agricultural businesses.  Strict inspections are in place, our licence is for the smaller, lower risk amount.” Portsmouth City Council leader Gerald Vernon-Jackson added: “Every port in the country imports fertiliser. It will be trucked out, it won’t sit around.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror dominic cummings free","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Dominic Cummings has a free pass that symbolises the Prime Ministers arroganceBoris Johnson’s regime has further undermined its fragile trust by sticking up two fingers at people over the behaviour of privileged No adviser Dominic Cummings who broke the lockdown rulesShareByVoice of the Mirror:,  AUG NewsopinionDominic Cummings \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Boris Johnson’s regime has further undermined its fragile trust by sticking up two fingers at people over the behaviour of privileged No adviser Dominic Cummings. In defying the growing clamour to respond to witnesses insisting they saw Cummings on a second lockdown-breaking visit to County Durham, suspicions understandably rise about what the Government has to hide. The head of Westminster’s all-party Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, has asked to “have the truth out in the open”. It is a legitimate appeal for transparency that a Downing Street confident of its position would be falling over itself to meet. Johnson giving Cummings a free pass symbolised the arrogance of a Prime Minister who behaves asrules are for the little people. If Cummings has evidence that he is not a serial offender, let him publish or be damned. Hard Prest PRESTON in Lancashire is the latest town to be put under local lockdown – worrying evidence that this virus is not beaten. This crisis could go either way, with the Office for National Statistics suggesting the number of infections in England may be levelling off – while experts on the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies recently warned “it does not have confidence” that the vital R reproduction rate is below one in England.  Imposing local restrictions inconveniences families but the measures are necessary. It’s better to lock down areas where the virus surges now than risk a second shutdown of the entire country in the coming winter.

The -year-old, from Chicago, had initially showed no other symptoms. He was admitted to hospital and when he had his temperature checked it was .C. But a scan on his lungs showed indications that he was struggling with his lung capacity. The man was put in an isolation room where he was tested for coronavirus. His temperature later increased to .C. The report stated: Here we present a case of persistent hiccups as the presenting symptom of a Covid- infection in a -year-old man. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of persistent hiccups as the presenting complaint in a Covid- positive patient in emergency medicine literature. The doctors from Cook County Health, Chicago, said patients with hiccups should not be dismissed, the Sun reports.  They added: Physicians should keep Covid- infection on their dferential as more cases are discovered through atypical presentations.

In a Facebook post, she wrote: “‘You get dressed up a lot.

But Mr Sunak confirmed the furlough scheme will end in October.“Eight months of support from start to finish is a considerable period of time for the government helping to pay people’s wages and I just don’t think that is something that can go on indefinitely.”Chancellor Rishi SunakHeading north of the border to publicise the billions that the Treasury has spent on supporting people during the pandemic, Mr Sunak was askedthere would be more help for Aberdeen.“The Scottish Government no doubt will be talking to Aberdeen and providing whatever support they think is appropriate in those circumstances,” the Chancellor said.Mr Sunak added that local business support was a “devolved matter” and therefore the responsibility of the Scottish Government.“The Scottish Government has done slightly dferent things in how they’ve decided to support businesses and that’s absolutely their right and I’m sure they will be looking at that,” he added.The Chancellor also repeated the UK Government’s line that now was not the time for a second Scottish independence referendum because efforts should be focused on recovering from the coronavirus crisis.With the SNP riding high in the polls, he also expressed the hope that, as time went on, voters would acknowledge the billions of pounds the UK Government had provided during the crisis.#I would hope that people when they go through this and reflect on what’s happened they can see the benefit of the Union. It is not just the economic measures, jobs in Scotland are equally as important to me as equally anywhere  in the United Kingdom. As we think about our recovery measures that we are putting in place again it will benefit jobs everywhere, but especially jobs in Scotland with regards tourism.#On the health side there has been an enormous amount of collaboration whether it has been on testing, PPE or vaccines and bit by bit I hope those are the kinds of arguments that people will see the benefit of the Union.#Mr Sunak argued UK schemes such as Eat Out to Help Out and VAT reductions in the tourism sector can#disproportionately benefit the Scottish economy  and Scottish jobs and in doing so help drive the UK recovery#.He said: #So to me, all of that experience shows me the Union has an enormous resonance today and hopefully people will recognise that.#The Chancellor also said he didn#t think #now is the time to be talking about these constitutional questions.#I think everyone#s sole focus, and certainly my sole focus right now, is doing what we can to protect people#s jobs and their livelihoods at what is an incredibly dficult time for our economy, and that#s what I think everybody should be focused on. Let#s not focus on these isive constitutional questions, let#s focus on rebuilding for the future.#On his trip to Glasgow and the Isle of Bute, he resisted calls for the furlough scheme to be extended beyond October.“Eight months of support from start to finish is a considerable period of time for the government helping to pay people’s wages and I just don’t think that is something that can go on indefinitely,” the Chancellor said.He argued that having people out of the labour market for a long period would not help their job prospects.“It would be easy to tell people it’s all going to be fine and that job will be there. That won’t be true for everybody and, in those circumstances, having people not attached to the labour market for that prolonged period of time is not doing them any favours.“All the academic evidence and practical economic evidence that we have on labour market outcomes tells us that. People not being attached to a workplace is not good for their long-term prospects. If it is not going to be the case that that job is going to be there, we are better off providing new opportunities and dferent types of support.”With people in Aberdeen potentially missing out on his Eat Out to Help scheme with theto lockdown, Mr Sunak appeared reluctant to make allowances for them.“We have kept it as a national scheme for the month,# he said. #We keep everything under review, but it is tricky to figure out exactly the right way to tweak that. It is complex. Hopefully what we see with these local lockdowns is that they are not going to be very long in duration,” the Chancellor said.The Federation of Small BusinessesScotland called for Aberdeen firms to receive more help.A FSB spokesman said: #The longer the Aberdeen lockdown continues, the more likely it is that businesses who, through no fault of their own, have been forced to close – or who remain open, but have seen footfall plummet – will need support.#The amount and nature of that support that will matter more to them than whether it comes from the Council, Holyrood or Westminster.  That said, we know that, as where in the UK, funds earmarked for local support grants in Scotland are underspent.  Re-purposing that cash to set up a support fund for businesses hit by local lockdowns would seem a sensible place to start.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It’s a particularly weak safeguard.Alongside this, the temptation to still carry out day-to-day activities, and the growing laxity in precautions being taken in the general population, meant it was only a matter of time before someone ed a positive test.After playing a part in a successful tournament-style season over in the US, I witnessed first-hand the protocols expected to be followed by players.As a league we were not entirely free from the controversy, as prior to our own start we also had one team caught out by the naivety of a few. This markedly similar incident resulted in the elimination of that team’s participation altogether, which was devastating to those who had followed the rules and also to the fans, sponsors and wider community who were impacted.While the final guidelines we had to follow were relentlessly strict and burdensome, they were ultimately essential to controlling the contact with anybody outside of our “bubble”.For us, partners and family were not allowed to enter our home environment after a pre-set tournament start date unless willing to also follow the safety rules.Meanwhile, trips to shops, cafes and supermarkets were absolutely forbidden for every player, and their respective household members, who had to adhere to the same sanctions once they chose to also be part of the safe zone which was created.Food was prepared and sent out through contactless delivery for every meal and the league carried out an anonymous honesty scheme, where any players caught in breach of the rules could be called out.The full guidelines we had to adhere to in the NWSL perhaps would never have been agreed to here because it would be deemed too much, but the control over exposure to any outside contact should certainly still remain one of the greatest priorities for the players and their immediate family.Theto football is something we are all excited about and hopeful for and – for players – there are additional moral obligations to act in a way which exceeds the precautions taken by the general public.Whether fair or not, the ramications and scrutiny over us is far greater than most, but ultimately we are the greatest beneficiaries because we get to play football every day and earn money doing so.Of course, we all want many things to be able toas they were before and I certainly didn’t enjoy living in the environment we were asked to in the United States.It was extremely isolating, I really missed being able to go to certain cafes and food stops and the daily tick-box requirements became draining over time. However, the bigger picture meant it was a very small ask for the benefit of having theof our game.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July . Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

This will make the air feel cool as the ice evaporates.Avoid things that can cause humidityA hot shower, the washing machine and the dishwasher all produce steam which can cause humidity and make a

Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May.

Just weeks later EIF  was formally cancelled, and the  pages of the Edinburgh International Festival  programme became an irrelevance.Linehanrsquos focus moved to how his organisation could help sustain its broad range of partners, from inidual artists to Scotlandrsquos national performing companies, and from the venues his event fills that have now been dark for months to the other festivals that make Scotlandrsquos capital such an unrivalled cultural destinationldquoAfter cancellation we needed the month of April to consider where we were and what we had to do, he told me last week. ldquoIt was in May that we started dreaming things up to do in June and July. We didnrsquot want to start chasing shadows. I actually feel that we have pushed as far as we can in relation to this year and some of the other ideas that were knocking about wouldnrsquot have happened. Wersquod have ended up doing all the planning before they proved impossible.ldquoThere were ideas for the Fireworks Concert for example, but we can now see that we would not be able to be doing that. What we have been able to do is support the eco-system but not draw huge crowds of people together. None of us is in the business of that at the moment.ldquoIt took some time for us to decide how we can be useful and how we could make plans that werenrsquot just good for the Festival but were good for the arts and good for the city. Even within that we have had to walk a very fine line.The devastating effects of Covid- on the modus operandi of much of the arts may seem to put all of Edinburghrsquos Festivals in the same boat, but it also reveals major dferences between what they do and how they engage with their artists and the audience.Director Nick Barleyrsquos book festival programme has been widely praised as exemplary, for the quality of content it has maintained in a move to being an entirely online event. It is true, however, that the nature of the vast bulk of its activity ndash readings, one-to-one interviews, and an opportunity for questions ndash was well-suited to digital s.The crisis even solved some of the dficulties the book festival has in its in-tray, including the vexed issue of the remuneration of participating writers attending to promote their books and the sustainability of the New Townrsquos elegant Charlotte Square as the festivalrsquos principal venue. If it is as well delivered as it has been conceived, some of the Book Festivalrsquos loyal audience may suggest the online experience has much to recommend itself.The Fringe, on the other hand, looks a lost cause, evenits participating artists include many of the most tech-savvy in the country. Lots of old-school arts marketing wisdom hangs around the Fringe because the world-wide web is relatively useless at serving its unique character. Its audience has very little in common apart from being in the same geographical location at the same time. One of the best ways to reach it remains hand-delivering a printed leaflet person-to-person in the street. Devotees of the Fringe arrive in Edinburgh without any plan for what they might go to see and hear, and stalk the streets with an increasingly dog-eared publication as an always-flexible agenda of cultural consumption takes shape around pit-stops for food and drink. Being an inidual in a vast throng, up close with most of the performers, is the essence of the experience, and definably the one that the health emergency prohibits.ldquoWhen we were in the deepest darkest bit of this, the only lights that were on in city venues were the lsquoghost lightsrsquo on the stages, Linehan says. ldquoSo we asked people to think about that, and that led to the idea of turning on all the lights in the theatres, and going to the other extreme and lighting up the night sky.ldquoThis is a story of lsquothe Festivalsrsquo and not just us. We are utterly interdependent on each other and I think thatrsquos really come across in what we are doing. It is just as important for us to light up Summerhall and Bristo Square as it is for us to light up the Usher Hall and Festival Theatre. I hope it sends out a positive message to the world, when there is someone from CNN standing on an empty Royal Mile and saying something funereal. The artists are all still here the creativity doesnrsquot go away.The lights will come on across Edinburgh this evening as the Festivalrsquos My Light Shines On gala on BBC Scotland TV and the EIF YouTube Channel ends. Presented by Kirsty Wark and the Scottish Chamber Orchestrarsquos hugely popular cello player Su-a Lee, it will include excerpts of work filmed for the EIFrsquos online presence in Edinburgh venues by all of Scotlandrsquos national performing arts companies.ldquoAnd there are some beautul projects, says Linehan. ldquoHope Dickson Leachrsquos film for the NTS and Paul Lewis playing Beethoven are just exquisite. We also have Jenni Fagan reading in Charlotte Square, and Daniel Sloss doing stand-up in Bristo Square. Alan Cumming and Ian McKellen are calling in. It is all a bit of lsquora-ra-ra the Festivalsrsquo.Celebration is only the surface benefit of My Light Shines On in Linehanrsquos book, however.ldquoWe asked people how we could be useful. We talked to companies who had the capacity to move on to the next stage, and in footballing terms it is the equivalent of playing behind closed doors as opposed to showing reruns of old matches. We are doing Festival projects in theatres and in concert halls but without the audience. It is the first time the orchestras and dance companies have been able to come together and it was incredibly complicated, as it is for sport.ldquoThat has had two big effects. It creates the protocols and the systems for people to be able to come back together again in the venues, and that is the big thing that performing artists have been longing for.ldquoAnd practically it meant more than  people working on this and being paid to do so, and that is hugely important. To be blunt about it, the process has been just as important as whatever the outcome is. I canrsquot tell you how complicated it was to put the SCO back together again on a stage, or the dancers of Scottish Ballet.ldquoPutting all that back together, contracting people and giving those venues rental was our job ndash and then lighting up the city over what would have been our opening weekend without attracting big crowds. It is a very practical programme built around resilience and solidarity that hopefully will send out a positive and optimistic message.ldquoThis has been a very practical exercise. People need to be engaged and contracted again and what is key is how we give meaningful and valuable work to people over the next year in a way that has value for the widest possible community. That is going to be a big challenge. There are lots of other things we could do in terms of profile, repurposing stuff from the archive, which is lovely, but it doesnrsquot address the big questions that we need to wrestle with.Grappling with the legacy of Covid-,and when it is no longer a clear and present danger, also has implications for Linehan personally, who had planned to end his tenure as festival director with the th event in .ldquoOne thing we do have is a bit of time, he says cautiously, ldquoand I am conscious of the degree to which we are normally hurtling towards another Festival and delivering it properly and balancing the books, and that takes a lot of your creative energy.ldquoThe  anniversary celebrations now take on a dferent tone because I need to make sure that the Festival is as robust as possible. We need to take a slightly longer perspective and start thinking about .

The MP for Moray has even less public profile than Mr Carlaw, who at least was known for selling cars.You wonder how long the party can survive this before it lapses into historical irrelevance. Of course, the Scottish Tory Party will always be kept alive by its umbilical relationship with the UK Conservatives. A relationship which is both its salvation and its curse.Murdo Fraser MSP, the former deputy Tory leader, wisely realised this after the  referendum and proposed a breakaway Scottish party, like the Canadian Liberals or the Baian CDU. But it ainrsquot gonna happen ndash certainly not under Mr Ross, who appears to want to continue banging away at the old dead Union themes.That no one is listening should be evident to everyone who looks at the opinion polls or talks to Scottish voters. A line has been crossed since Brexit. The Union as it is now is no longer viable. It has become a focus of discontent as Scotland is shoe-horned into a new UK internal market replacing the EU single market.There is another way. Over the past couple of years there has been talk in Unionist circles of a new Act of Union to cement the new post-Brexit relationship. The Prime Minister is thought to be interested in something dramatic that would redefine relationships in this ldquoawesome foursome, as he calls Britain.The unionist columnist Stephen Daisley put flesh on the bones in an article this week. This new Act of Union would, in his model, restore the sovereignty of Westminster in a unitary UK state. It would define what the powers of the Scottish Parliament are, instead of leaving them open-ended as is the case in the  Scotland Act.ldquoBring it on, says Nicola Sturgeon. On the face of it, this would seem like the ultimate power grab ndash abandoning all pretence that the Scottish Parliament is anything other than a talking shop, a unit of local government, Strathclyde Region writ large.And yet, there could be something in this New Union ideaturned upside down and used to recognise not subordination, but Scottish autonomy. It could even come in the form of a new Treaty of Union, as in , to embrace a new constitutional reality.Such a treaty would recognise that Scotland and England still want to be part of Great Britain, as it also said in . But it would start from the premise that Scotland is a country in its own right. That Scotland voluntarily relinquished its sovereignty in , but now intends to run its own affairs in a new legal partnership.This New Union would recognise that Scotlandrsquos Parliament exercises entrenched constitutional powers: something that was promised in the post-ldquoVow Scotland Act in , but wasnrsquot delivered, as the Supreme Court ruled in .This New Union would be regarded by diehard unionistas a capitulation: not so much an Act of Union as an Act of Disunion. However, it could also be the creation of a new Union of equals ndash one that draws on the past but recognises changed realities.Like the European Union, this Union would be a legally-binding partnership of nominally independent countries. It would be defined by a commitment to common economic, social and environmental objectives, free movement, human rights, common trading standards, mutual defence and a common currency.Giving Holyrood full economic powers, including tax and borrowing, but within the confines of a common currency, would keep Scotland within the tent, much as countries like Slovakia and Slovenia are within the European Union. They are both sovereign countries, but their currency is the euro, they obey the Maastricht stability rules on debt and accept Brusselsrsquo right to regulate trade and negotiate treaties on their behalf.Scotland would be in charge of most of its own affairs, but would remain part of a United Kingdom under the Queen. That this echoes  Independence White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Future, drafted by one Nicola Sturgeon, is no accident. That was not a prospectus for separation, but for confederalism, as some of us argued at the time.After all, what does Westminster really need from Scotland  It needs a common travel area, a viable internal market, a common currency, defence and mutual security. Thatrsquos really it. England doesnrsquot need the hassle and expense of the day-to-day running of Scotland it just needs a recognition that Great Britain still exists as a geopolitical entity and that the UK is a unitary economic space ndash just like the EU.This kind of relationship would make sense following Brexit. Scotland would cease to be a Barnett supplicant. The Scottish Government would have to take responsibility for managing economic affairs within the constraints of legally-binding Treaty obligations.I think Dominic Cummings would be all over this. I think Sir Keir Starmer might be too. A new Union that saves Britain from Balkanisation and emphasises solidarity and common interests would be supported by the Liberal Democrats.Indeed, it is not inconceivable that Ms Sturgeon might see some merit in an Act of Disunion. It gets her off the referendum hook and would allow her to claim that Scotland was becoming independent, not by conflict and disruption as in Catalonia, but through reasoned discussion and negotiation.At any rate, something has to be done. Britain finally leaves Europe in the New Year ndash just in time for the Holyrood elections, which promise to be a blood bath for the unionist parties. Boris Johnson canrsquot just pretend itrsquos business as usual. Offering more cash backed by dark threats wonrsquot wash.Scotland needs to be sorted so he can concentrate on Brexit. If and when the SNP wins a majority in Mayrsquos Scottish elections, the Prime Minister should show true Churchillian radicalism by offering his own Plan B ndash challenging Scotland to join a new partnership of equals.

Mr Ross has already touched on this in his initial thoughts on the leadership ndash he would like more power to be shared out from Edinburgh and, as an Aberdonian like Mr Ross, I approve. Holyrood should not be the full-stop of devolution.Mr Rossrsquos roots in Aberdeen also, I think, may explain other parts of his political thinking. Much of Scotlandrsquos image as a place of radical politics was formed to the sound of the hammer and the pickaxe ndash it came from the shipyards and factories and coal mines, and because of that, Glasgow became the capital of Scotlandrsquos radicalism, first with Labour and now with the SNP.But the radicalism of Glasgow is not the whole story. In the Highlands, therersquos a much more liberal tradition, and the further north you go, the more liberal it gets, while up in Aberdeen and down in Dumfries-shire and the Borders, therersquos a strong streak of conservatism. In Aberdeen, some of it may come from our cautious natures: radicalism equals change, and we donrsquot like change.As Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross has the capacity to tap into those feelings, but therersquos an extra factor which may work in his favour in the way it did for Ruth Davidson. Mr Ross is not a Tory toff or the kind of Anglicised Scot that used to represent the Tories. Hersquos from an ordinary background and his views and instincts reflect what a lot of other Scots from ordinary backgrounds think.Take his call for ldquotougher enforcement against Gypsy Travellers for instance. The SNP immediately cried ldquoracist! before downgrading it to ldquoabhorrent!, but itrsquos perfectly fair to be concerned about illegal camps, and this is where the metropolitan effect kicks in again: middle-class, city liberals assume everyone thinks like they do, on race, sex, gender, or Brexit, but they donrsquot. Many Scots in large parts of the country are more cautious and conservative.The SNPrsquos tactic on all of this ndash and itrsquos already wobbled ndash is to portray Mr Rossrsquos conservatism as extreme, but actually he is from a Scottish tradition of right-of-centre pragmatic conservatism that still exists. Take his views on Brexit. The SNP said he had ldquofailed to stand up for Scotland by backing an extreme Brexit but he is merely taking the view that a lot of centrist Scots now take: we voted Remain but letrsquos try to get the best Brexit we can.Mr Rossrsquos common sense was also at work in the Dominic Cummings affair. He was the only minister to resign over it, saying he could not in good faith defend a government advisor who had travelled hundreds of miles during the initial stages of lockdown, and his resignation was a good sign for his future as Scottish Tory leader. If he erges from the rest of the UK party when he sees fit, as Ruth Davidson did, it will serve him well.All of these factors could help Mr Ross connect with voters in the centrist middleas well as a large part of conservative Scotland including the socially conservative working-class parts of urban Scotland. But the problem he has is that hersquos taking over during a public health crisis in which the SNP government is seen to be doing well. It is this, perversely, that has helped support for independence to edge over %: the less Nicola Sturgeon has talked about independence, the more people have supported it.The question is: what happens when le s to normality in Scotland ie the SNP banging on about independence every day  It was frustration with that approach among ordinary Scots ndash and Ruth Davidsonrsquos plain-speaking ability to capitalise on it ndash that led to the Tory surge in . Could it happen again under Mr Ross To be honest, at the moment, itrsquos hard to see how ndash the circumstances of  are unlikely to repeat themselves in time for the next Scottish election. But at least the Tories will have a leader who has some of the same qualities as Ms Davidson. He sounds normal. Hersquos from an ordinary background. Hersquos willing to do his own thing.

Teachers continue to work their fingers to the bone to convert deliver lessons online which the week before had been taught in class. They also deliver food parcels or anything  that it is within their power to aid their pupils.. Exams are cancelled and then Government backtracks on a decision to assess coursework, ignore teachers recommendations and trust the pupils futures to a statistical model and in the process, in regards to the efforts of teachers to continue despite all obstacles, adds insult to injury. Lets recall that old saying - \"theres lies, damned lies and then theres statistics\".. The reason for not assessing coursework of course was that poorer pupils may not have had access to laptops computers or parental support re home schooling. To assess the work would have provided evidence of the continuing disparity between social groups.. Consequently, that would have of course laid bare the lack of success in general in improving the lot of the working class, the \"levelling-up\" of society, closing the attainment gap, improving social mobility.. The model employed based on previous records, actually reinforces the attainment gap and now we have the statistics to prove it. Any occurrence of improvement is considered a mere blip on the graph the blip represents the hopes and ambitions of a human being.The whole process smacks of inertia in the face of adversity, compounding the calamity visited upon us. The lack of respect for the teaching profession by the Government is a disgrace. It now dictates that, not only do teachers pick up the pieces but risk their health in the process. It seeks to enlist more teachers to deal with the conditions Covid sets it will be fortunate to convince teachers in post to remain.Maureen McGarry-OHanlon, Balloch.THE SQA, by setting its historical precedent to downgrade students results on the grounds of the areas their schools were in, has delivered an almighty and metaphorical slap in the face to all those teachers who in all sincerity presented the grades they felt their students merited on the basis of their performances throughout their abbreviated certicate year. This decision has called into question the professionalism of the classroom practitioners.What is also inexcusable is the the degradation imposed upon the high hopes of pupils who were clearly A students by the devaluation of their efforts.As a former member of the profession, I can safely testy that a teacher knows an A student when the teacher sees one.No teachers worthy of the name would tamper with a students results, knowing full well that this would be to the detriment of a pupils future.There can be no doubt that the SQA was placed in a dficult situation as a result of the Covid- shutdown, but it ought to have shown more resilience and sensitivity in its approach to the delivery of results which should have reflected the reality of the actual performance of any student rather than the historical performance of any school.There can be no doubt that we will hear much more about this unhappy state of affairsDenis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.NICOLA Sturgeon says she wishes to be judged on her ability to close the education achievement gap between the better-off and the poorest in Scotland. A worrying aspect of the SQA fiasco is the fact that it seems designed to reinforce the achievement gap and even embed it in the system. By choosing to dictate that able students from poorer families cannot be given credit beyond some statistical average it sends the message that they shouldnt even bother trying.Given that the rules for Scottish university entrance favour middle-class EU applicants over working-class Scottish students, you would be forgiven for believing that, far from wishing to close the gap by improving the lot of our less-well-off, the SNP is designing a system which reinforces an already unfair disadvantage and bakes that disadvantage into the system, to the further detriment of working-class Scottish pupils.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.AND now for some facts.Those exam results were assessments by the teachers. You know, the folk who know the pupils. They were not by the Scottish Government or by John Swinney. They were presented to the SQA, the body that supervises exams in Scotland.

As things stand, the Scottish Government looks justied in having placed Aberdeen back into special measures, dficult though the decision must have been.Blanket restrictions of this sort, which create so much dficulty for those not directly affectedmay be necessary now. They are, however, no long-term solution.Instead, government should be focusing more on inidual responsibility, which may mean a more rigorous policing of those who flout the rules. Those who, after donning their masks and queuing correctly before entering shops, then blithely ignore the requirement to maintain distance need to be reminded of their responsibilities. Penalties should be enforced on those who fail to self-isolate on theirfrom foreign holidays.It is understandably dficult to maintain these rules in environments such as pubs, but those landlords who have made determined efforts to reorganise their businesses for their customersrsquo safety should not be penalised for the irresponsibility of those happy to throw caution to the wind. Local authorities already have ample powers to withdraw licences from unruly venues the warning that they will not hesitate to use them to protect health in this emergency might win the attention of those which have been too casual in their approach.As schools prepare toafter a long and damaging hiatus, the First Minister is surely right that education is a greater priority than the freedom to have a pint in a scrum by the bar. The example of Aberdeenrsquos footballers suggests that some young people, buoyed by their own sense of invulnerability and relatively low level of susceptibility to the diseasersquos worst effects, have forgotten that the rules ndash as with masks ndash are not primarily for their protection, but of those who are vulnerable to devastating outcomes.That may seem like excessive caution, unnecessary for the majority, but it illustrates why Aberdeen had to reenter lockdown. If iniduals take greater care with their own behaviour, such scattergun approaches may be avoidable, but they are inevitablepeople do not abide by the rules, whether or not they think they have much relevance for their own circumstances. Scotland has come a long distance, but it cannot afford to lose its way at this critical juncture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-tory-leader-says-independence-non-issue-holyrood-election","story":"Despite the Scottish Tories making the SNP threat to the Union the focusof recent campaigns, their new leader said he would rather it melted into the background.He also denied his record as a UK minister in the Scotland Office until May would be a \"millstone when tackling the SNP Government over its record tackling coronavirus.After Decemberrsquos general election, Nicola Sturgeon asked Boris Johnson to give Holyrood the power to hold Indyref, saying she had a clearmandate from the electorate.The Prime Minister refused in January, citing Ms Sturgeon and Alex Salmondrsquos ldquopersonal promise that the  referendum was a once in a generation vote.He said: \"The UK Government will continue to uphold the democratic decision of the Scottish people and the promise that you made to them. For that reason, I cannot agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums.\"Another independence referendum would continue the political stagnation that Scotland has seen for the last decade, with Scottish schools, hospitals and jobs again left behind because of a campaign to separate the UK.Butwith polls indicating an SNP majority in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election, there is growing speculation Mr Johnson may allow Indyrefvoters back Ms Sturgeonrsquos position.Asked today whether Mr Johnsonrsquos refusal made Indyref a moot point in the election, thereby denying the Scottish Tories one of their traditional battle cries, Mr Ross said: ldquoThe Prime Minister has been very clear in his position on another isive independence referendum six years on from our once in a generation vote.ldquoI really hope it is a non-issue next May because that means politics has moved on from the constitutional ision that has dominated our political debate in the last six years.ldquoThat has suited the SNP because they donrsquot have to defend their record on failing services.ldquoWhat wersquove seen from young people demonstrating in Glasgow today, they want to see their politicians focusing on education and on their future, and thatrsquos what Irsquom looking to do as leader of the Scottish Conservatives.Asked whether Mr Johnsonrsquos refusal meant Unionists could back the SNP next year knowingthe UKwas safe, Mr Ross said the SNP would still try to use every vote to justy independence and continue constitutional ision.He said: ldquoSadly, the SNP will use every opportunity to ide our country and separate Scotland from the rest of the UK, the most successful economic and political union the world has seen, and they will use next Mayrsquos election for their ultimate aim as well.ldquoWhat I want to make loud and clear is the strongest pro-Union party on the ballot next year will be the Scottish Conservatives that I lead.ldquoBut I also want use to focus not just on that constitutional argument, but positive cases for remaining part of the Union, and a positive vision for using our devolved powers in Scotland to improve the lives of people theand breadth of the country.Mr Ross, who became leader unopposed on Wednesday, also denied that his time as a UK minister at the start of the pandemic would haunt him when his party challenged the SNP Governmentrsquos record on Covid.He said: ldquoDo I think my role within the UK Government is a millstone around my neck during this pandemic  No, I donrsquot. I think what people expect is the UK and Scottish Governments to work together, which they did successfully at the early stage of this pandemic.ldquoI will be constructiveI think the Scottish Government have taken the right approach but I will also scrutinise any errors that have been made to ensure the are not repeated."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11672294.jpg?type=article-full","title":"calum-murray-pathway-sustainable-future-clear","story":"ldquoWe are seeing real interest, particularly from businesses who have already done a good deal to lower their carbon footprint and who now want to find meaningful ways of offsetting the rest of their carbon output, he says.Murray points out that things have moved on hugely from Scotlandrsquos initial mass reforestation efforts in the mid-s to s. Those efforts were driven almost solely with an eye to commercial s and led to a general perception that these woods were dark, forbidding deserts as far as wildle and flora were concerned.For some years now new forest plantings by Tilhill Forestry and other forestry companies have focused on creating woodlands that encourage bioersity as well as providing commercial s that consistently outperform global stock markets.ldquoToday, there is a well understood need for the planting of new forests to create a balance between commercial requirements and the need to create forests that enhance the natural environment, Murray comments.One of the benefits of companies turning to forestry as a way of offsetting their residual carbon footprint, is that it makes money available for schemes that perhaps would not be commercially viable without additional financial support.ldquoThere are some great government grants for tree planting, but we often find customers struggling with potential projects in marginal land that just fall short of being commercially viable. This is where the investment from carbon-offsetting schemes can lt the whole project, leading to the planting of many hectares of forests that otherwise would not happened, he comments.Tilhill and other established forestry companies act as brokers to connect companies with a requirement for carbon offsetting, with landlords who have schemes that could be viable, given additional sources of investment.As Murray notes, commercial forestry does not just lock up carbon for the forty years or so that the trees are maturing. When the wood is turned into building timber, the carbon in the timber continues to be locked away for many decades thereafter.ldquoThe whole forestry industry has learned the lessons from the mistakes of the past. I walk through commercial woodlands every day and they are alive with deer and a wide iety of birdle, as well as a range of wild flowers.Many commercial forestry projects these days also include a iety of deciduous tree plantings in order to create a balance. When it comes to locking up carbon, Murray points out that it doesnrsquot matter whether the driving idea behind the creation of the forest is commercial, or a desire to restore some of Scotlandrsquos indigenous woodland. Both take carbon out of the atmosphere. However, fast growing commercial woodlands comprised largely of Sitka Spruce will lock up more carbon faster than deciduous woodlands, which mature at a much slower rate.ldquoIt is dficult to overstate the importance of commercial forestry to Scotlandrsquos rural communities.ldquoIt brings much needed jobs to rural areas at all phases in the le of a forest, from the initial planting, through the letime maintenance of the forest and in the harvesting, he says.Murray adds that as well as the wider societal and environmental values that woodland brings, through the positive impact it has on carbon sequestration, reforestation also improves an arearsquos water quality and helps with both flood mitigation and bioersity.ldquoWe are seeing a real uptick in investors who are attracted both by the idea that investing in forests helps to preserve the environment for their children and grandchildren, and by the recognition that s from forestry tend not to be correlated with the ups and downs in the mainstream equities and bonds markets, he says.The combined appeal of a goodon their investment along with the idea that they are helping to combat climate change, is stoking investor interest in the sector. ldquoForestry particularly favours those seeking long term capital gains and increasingly it will favour lsquoheritage investorsrsquo, those for whom ecological and climate change mitigation concerns rate as high or higher than concerns over the scale of monetary s, he notes.One of the positive stories over the past year was that Scotland finally managed to achieve the Scottish Governmentrsquos planting targets. ldquoThe Scottish Government has set an annual planting target of , hectares of new forest. Last year we actually achieved in excess of , hectares of new plantings, Murray says.The governmentrsquos target is set to rise to , hectares a year by . However, Murray points out that to meet the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans to go carbon neutral by , we should already be planting , hectares a year across the UK. England, which is still doing very little new planting, needs to take a leaf out of Scotlandrsquos book and get busy planting, he says.Tilhill Forestry is currently running a project called ldquo#PlantTreesAplentyIn. This is a campaign launched by Tilhill to encourage farmers, landowners and companies to plant trees on their unproductive land.As Murray explains, as part of this campaign Tilhill can help landowners and farmers decide what trees to plant and where to plant them. Todayrsquos new woodlands offer opportunities for wildle, recreation and will play a part in mitigating climate change.Planting a well-planned woodland on land that is marginal for agricultural use can help to provide shelter for cattle and sheep, as well as providing the farmer with a decent pension on retirement.This article appeared in The Heralds Earth Overshoot Day series, under the topic of Nature and how we boost our ecosystems.For more information on the#PlantTreesAplentyIn please visitwww.tilhillTo participate in The Heralds Earth Overshoot Day coverage on the nd August please contact Stephen McTaggart on  or by email atstephen.mctaggart@heraldandtimes"},{"url":null,"title":"ross-hang-referee-boots-first-minister","story":"Mr Ross, who has kept up his ssecond job throughout his political career, saidsecurity concerns meant he would have to ldquohang up his bootshe succeeded in his goal of replacing Nicola Sturgeon at Bute House.However he said he wouldkeep running the line at domestic and international matches as the new Scottish Tory leader, despite inevitably bringing morepolitical baggage onto the pitch.Speaking to the media after meeting Chancellor Rishi Sunak near Glasgow, the Moray MP said: ldquoIrsquove made it clear I want to continue refereeing, however that is something I plan to do as leader of the Scottish Conservatives.ldquoI can officially announce thatI am elected First Minister of Scotland - much to the great delight of football fans across Scotland, and this may help me get to that ultimate office - then I would give up refereeingI was First Minister.He went on: ldquoThere is in my view enough pressure on the clubs, the match commanders, police etc, to ensure everything is done as safely as possible within our stadiums,ldquoI think an added element of potentially one of the match officials being the First Minister of Scotland does add unnecessary strain to an already sometimes hostile and dficult environment.ldquoI think it would make sense, at that stage, for me to hang up my boots and continue to support Scottish football.The -year-old added: ldquoI would still be a strong advocate for Scottish refereeing.

And it can start with the school run. We know thatwe are to get serious about tackling climate change, we will need a radical transformation in the way that we live our lives.But understandably, knowing where to start, and which part of our le to change first, can often feel daunting and overwhelming.However one small, and relatively easy switch to that greener, and more sustainable world we are trying to reach can start with something as simple as the school run. I know I canrsquot be alone in having mixed emotions about my children going back to school next week.On one hand, a steady routine will be a much longed-for blessing. As will be an empty house, as many of us continue to work from home. Meanwhile, my children are eager to get back to lessons and see their friends.But after five months of homeschooling, prolonged family time, and staying in one place, everything is at once the same, but also almost unrecognisably dferent. I canrsquot deny that for me, like many others, the past five months have been a time of much stress, anxiety and many sleepless nights.But, there have also been wonderful pockets of calm and joy. Having no option but to stay in one place and take a step back from my normal, hectic everyday le has made me appreciate the little things even more. For many, lockdown has rekindled their love of getting around on foot and by bike. Others have realised that distances between local landmarks are much shorter than they first thought. They have noticed the birds singing. Taken pleasure in local wildle. Met neighbours they hadnrsquot seen before, and tried to shop local.For me, it has been cycling along the normally busy streets with my children, without the fear of motor-traffic. Also the joys of discovering local sights in my neighbourhood that I never realised existed, on my daily walks.Yet this collective slower, gentler pace of living has had very little impact on global carbon emissions. Yes, there have been less people flyingand less people travelling unnecessary journeys by car , but there has only been a small drop in carbon emissions ndash a crucial contributor to the heating of our planet. Much of the global warming predicted to happen is already locked in and cannot be stopped.For example, the so called lsquoearth overshoot dayrsquo will fall on August nd. This term ldquoovershoot represents the level by which human population overshoots the sustainable amount of resources on Earth each year. After that day, we, as a planet are living beyond our means.Granted, due to to Covid-, this August nd date is an improvement of last yearrsquos date of July th. But as a whole, this yearly date has been getting steadily earlier.We cannot and should not expect a global economic and health disaster such as the coronavirus pandemic to slow the destruction of the planet. And we all know we need to do more, both collectively and as iniduals,we are to be serious about helping to reduce our impact on the planet. If lockdown has taught me anything, it is that small, simple changes to my everyday habits can make a huge, and indeed very positive impact on my le and my relationship with the people I love.Which brings me back to the school run. At present, the highest proportion of Scotlandrsquos carbon emissions are emissions from transport ndash in particular private cars. Cars cause % of transport emissions in Scotland, and evenevery new car sold in Scotland in  were electric, wersquod still need to reduce overall car mileage by % to meet our climate commitments.Meanwhile, the recent Hands Up Scotland survey, which tracks how children travel to school, showed that more children were travelling to school by car than ever before in .The start of the new school term next week is a chance to try out new behaviours and change old habits. And leaving the car at home for the school run should be one of these. Many of us are still working from home. And others will have a renewed appreciation for walking and cycling. By embracing the chance to try something dferent, a small change to the way our children travel to school can not only be a healthy way to start the day, for parents and children alike, but good for our planet too.It could become a chance to spend time with our children and taken in our surroundings. I donrsquot know about you, but part of me will actually miss my kids being around so much.Of course, this wonrsquot be for everyone. For a start, not everyone works from home. Many also need to drive to the school ndash including children who have physical or sensory disabilities.But as Scotlandrsquos Active Nation Commissioner, Lee Craigie has said, those of us who can, should leave the roads clear for those who need them. So what is needed to turn the school run into a walk, a bike or scooter ride  In most cases, itrsquos a safe route to school.In some cases the presence of lsquoschool streetsrsquo can help. This is when streets around schools are closed to motor traffic at pick up and drop off times. Recent research has shown that moves like this increase the number of children walking, cycling or scooting to school, all whilst improving safety.And best of all, it generally doesnrsquot cause displacement of traffic to other streets. The point is,the conditions are right ndash in this case acting local, allowing ourselves to enjoy quiet streets, while seeing ourselves as part of something bigger - we can change habits. Radically. Thatrsquos what dealing with the pandemic needs.And when it comes to climate change, thatrsquos what the planet needs."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11673192.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nature-scotland-needs-nurturing","story":"LATER this month, the world will start to live on credit. Despite the economic ravages of Covid, it will not be a financial debt that we will start racking up. It will be far worse than that.August  has officially been declared Earth Overshoot Day. It is the moment in the annual calendar when humanityrsquos demand for ecological resources and services starts to exceed what nature can regenerate.At that moment, environmentally, we begin to borrow beyond our means. In fact, itrsquos actually worse than that. It means that for the final  days of , we are effectively stealing from the ecosystem.As we all share one planet, this is obviously a major problem for the whole of humanity. Scotland, however, is making a greater contribution than many other countries in working to offset this ecological deficit.We have long recognised that our natural environment is our greatest national asset. It not only sustains our health and wellbeing, but also boosts our economy in general and rural areas in particular.Food, whisky, renewable energy and tourism are all sectors which all bring in revenue as well as leveraging off our reputation as one of the greenest countries on the planet.Despite our reputation as a global leader in tackling climate change ndash we have the most ambitious set of statutory targets in the world - Scotland faces many of the same challenges as other countries. Growing carbon emissions threaten ecosystems everywhere, driving loss of bioersity and threatening all our futures.The need for urgent action has never been clearer, but there is at least a strong determination in this country to address the issues. One important bioersity initiative is a new pound billion routemap for nature conservation published by the Scottish Wildle Trust and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency .Its proposals include a Marine Fund ndash also backed by RSPB Scotland among others ndash to restore habitats, develop innovative management approaches and help with the recovery of species such as puffins.Other investment opportunities highlighted include introducing nature-based carbon payments taking a Net Positive for Nature approach a Nature-Climate Bond and nature-based carbon payments.Terry ArsquoHearn, Chief Executive of SEPA, comments: ldquoThe challenge provides an opportunity to bring together real world projects that spark regeneration of communities, build green businesses and create new jobs.Scotlandrsquos farmers have a crucial role in protecting our futures. If agricultural land is not used optimally, the results can be extremely damaging and have a number of linked outcomes.As an example of this, the Aberdeenshire-based James Hutton Institute points out that the decline in sheep numbers seen in recent decades can cause undergrazing.This in turn may mean changes in vegetation and loss of particular habitats, with a consequent negative effect on species.The institute argues for the adoption of High Nature Valuefarming, which supports low intensity agricultural systems. It says there is a case to be made for additional financial support to promote this.In order to protect the environment, we need to nurture not just the land, but the seas around us. Again, this is an area in which Scottish scientists are taking a lead.Edinburgh University is co-ordinating the ambitious, EU-funded iAtlantic project ndash the biggest initiative of its type ever mounted in the planetrsquos second largest ocean.It will assess its state of health, mapping uncharted parts for the first time and assessing the effects of climate change on plants and animals.Sonar and D modelling will be used and the end result will be a full digital map of the oceanrsquos ecosystem. Part of the project involves identying safe haven areas where marine le can be nurtured and prosper. The findings will be passed to governments around the world in the hope that they will take action.Scotlandrsquos own new environment strategy, published earlier this year just before the start of the Covid- outbreak, recognises the effort and achievements to date but acknowledges that there is still work to do.The Cabinet Secretary for the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, Roseanna Cunningham, says she is proud of the progress made to date.ldquoWe have the toughest, most ambitious framework on climate change in the world and have almost halved our greenhouse gases since , she adds. ldquoWe are recognised as leaders in developing a circular economy and have some of the most ambitious targets on waste in Europe.The report acknowledges the issues raised by Earth Overshoot Day, pointing out that while climate change is a key driver of loss of bioersity, natural habitats play a critical role in removing carbon from the atmosphere.These are the consequences, it says, of stretching the Earthrsquos systems beyond their sustainable limits.The report continues: ldquoThe need for action is clear. Tackling the crises will require urgent, transformative changes in economies and societies around the world.ldquoThis must promote a fairer distribution of resources between the rich developed world and poorer countries, who will be the first to suffer the effects of climate change and ecosystem collapse. Scotland is already making progress towards this transformation.What action can be taken to address what is the most important and defining problem of our age  Several ambitious initiatives are already underway.These include the State of Nature Scotland report, published in , which provides the countryrsquos clearest picture yet on bioersity. Woodland creation schemes are being implemented and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is providing the science needed to support the conservation of plants and fungi. One particular investigation is examining how rare Scottish mountain plants are being jeopardised by a loss of genetic ersity.Urban areas can also have an effect, both positive and negative, on the ecosystem. Decarbonisation of transport and a move towards walking and cycling will obviously make an impact, and it may well be that one result of the Covid- pandemic is a green-focused reimagining of our towns and cities.The Scottish Land Commission has helped to establish the Vacant and Derelict Land Taskforce. Bringing abandoned and unloved urban places back into productive use could help tackle climate change, improve health and wellbeing, create more resilient communities and assist in rebuilding the economy.Recommendations will be submitted to the Scottish Government later in the year. The commission is also preparing advice on the creation of a Regional Land Use Partnership, in order to ensure that all of Scotland can contribute to our climate targets.Sadly, we will probably be marking Earth Overshoot Day for years to come. But in Scotland, we can at least take comfort in the fact that we are taking plenty of action to help ensure that over time, we stop drawing down the capital of our greatest asset: the planet itself."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-kevin-mckenna-exams-betrayal-symptomatic-deeper-malaise-scottish-society","story":"The social gerrymandering of this yearrsquos exam-marking by the Scottish Qualications Authority penalised the nationrsquos most disadvantaged neighbourhoods.

This year, of all years, they might have felt they were entitled to a break. Every other year the system of academic preferment is programmed to reward affluence and economic muscle. Perhaps this time they might be judged on a level playing-field, after all theyrsquod been through. Dream on.Certainly, the pass rates might have been unusually higher but this has been the most extraordinary of years. Future generations would have understood. This week our children discovered there is no mercy in the hallowed system.Yet, all that was required was the capacity to think bigger and to imagine better to be spontaneous and nimble. Instead, all these children got was a rule-book waved in their faces and a letter telling them the computer said no. It seems the Scottish Government are much more focused on plans to criminalise the lieges. But hey the system has been preserved and therersquos just enough movement in the numbers to earn a tick.The Government has betrayed our most disadvantaged children when they needed their compassion. In two decades of unbroken left-wing, devolved administration in Scotland the same families, living in the same neighbourhoods are still experiencing the same wretched outcomes in their health and their chances of a better le. In England, the most right-wing government in modern political history saw this coming and made the necessary arrangements to preserve fairness. The Conservatives actually tweaked the system to favour children in need. Sweet Mother of God!A normal political party would be held to account on these issues by its own dissenting voices and perhaps be threatened with eviction at a nearby election. The SNP, though, is not a normal party. While it bears the eternal flame of independence its supporters are cowed to silence lest they be accused of jeopardising the Holy War, the unforgiveable sin. Independence, for the SNP hierarchy, has become a safety harness rather than a cause.In the two decades since devolution we have seen the rise of think-tanks and lobbying firms. These make a virtue of moderation and centrism and are cherished by the SNP because they instruct us all to sit up straight, behave ourselves and keep our mouths shut. All of them are inter-connected but not in a way thatrsquos visible to the naked eye.They harbour a few dozen of the elect who wield influence on policy and strategy. Together they form an intellectual and philosophical black hole where radical ideas disappear and die. In exchange for this they get invitations to sup at the Bute House Presidential Palace or get thrown a seat on a quango or a health board. Thus, the triumph of middle-class mediocrity is assured.This week, an outfit called the Commission for School Reform stepped up to provide relief for the Scottish Government. Its chairman, Keir Bloomer, architect of Curriculum forExcellence, said: ldquoIf anything, I think the overall set of results demonstrate that they [the SQA] have been slightly lenient.The Commission for School Reform is one of those prattling colloquies which occupies the same territory as think-tanks.

Before Jackson Carlaw resigned  ldquoNo, no, no, after.Pushed on whether it had been a carve up, she said: ldquoIrsquom terribly sorry, I donrsquot know what  to say apart from lsquoJackson Carlaw resigned, Douglas has put his hat into the ring, I think hersquos the best person for the job, Irsquom backing him and doing all I can to help.But even a masterful non-denial denial is never as good as the truth.Mr Ross has the same improbable chronology on his campaign website.ldquoMy first act on Thursday evening after Jackson Carlaw honourably announced his resignation was to speak to Ruth Davidson and ask her to support me in my plans.His first act  For such a le-changing decision, you would think hersquod talk to his family first, especially as the father of a one-year-old.Although therersquos also that Freudian slip at the end about ldquomy plans, which suggests his leadership bid wasnrsquot exactly spontaneous.Mr Ross didnrsquot clary things yesterday, when he was asked what he and Ms Davidson had discussed.It was, he said, a ldquoprivate meeting.The iron secrecy seems a bit odd for a social visit, so presumably weightier matters were indeed on the agenda.ldquoWhat I have said is that I asked Ruth, and she agreed, to lead FMQsI become leader only after Jackson resigned, he said, which again leaves a lot unanswered.Ms Davidson also has form on stitch-ups. When she ran for Scottish Tory leader in  it was a bitter affair, with her three rivals, including Mr Carlaw, complaining she was being unfairly helped by party HQ.The partyrsquos spindoctor at the time, Ramsay Jones, who was supposed to be neutral in the race, was found to have been at her house on the night of a campaign meeting. She denied hersquod been part of it, but later admitted the pair ldquoprobably did get on to the campaign at some point. Mr Jones was suspended, and left to work in Downing Street. Hersquos now a CBE.Ms Davidsonrsquos campaign manager was the MP John Lamont, who was also Mr Rossrsquos campaign manager.Hersquos a fast worker. Five Douglas Ross for Leader websites were registered within an hour of Mr Carlaw announcing his departure. Suspicious or just devilishly efficient In fact, there is a smoking gun. Well, some smoking metadata. Mr Rossrsquos campaign website carries a lsquoDouglas Ross for Leaderrsquo logo, and embedded in that logo, for those who know how to find it, is an electronic timestamp which shows it was created just before Mr Carlawrsquos resignation statement. Now that is uncommonly fast work.Well, so what, you may think. Politicians will be politicians.But other Holyrood stories this week showed why the Ross-Davidson flannel could have wider signicance.The inquiry into the Alex Salmond affair will be one of the biggest things on Ms Davidsonrsquos plate when she s to FMQs. It will be her job to prosecute the case for the Tories and wound Ms Sturgeon and the SNP ahead of the election.This week, we learned the FM withheld details of a relevant meeting about Mr Salmond from MSPs last year, and the Scottish Government also withheld reams of evidence from the inquiry on legal grounds.The Scottish Tories are now demanding full transparency.It will not be easy for Ms Davidson.Always remember that Ms Sturgeon was a lawyer before Holyrood.Her words are precisely chosen.I doubt very much that she directly misled MSPs with a bald lie.However it does look asMSPs have been misled by omission, with the First Minister telling them bits of the truth, but not the whole truth, and then letting a  impression take hold and doing nothing to correct it.But anyone planning to attack her on transparency grounds, with these high stakes, needs to be spotless, the very model of transparency.Questions over Ms Davidson and Mr Rossrsquos candour, and the series of extreme coincidences leading up to Mr Carlawrsquos departure, offer Ms Sturgeon a glimpse of a way out.lsquoWhy should I take lectures from this humbug with her record  Who is she to judge me rsquo she may say.Besides insulting our intelligence, Ms Davidson has already hamstrung herself in the contest to come."},{"url":null,"title":"bus-operators-receive-63m-government-funding-timetables-return","story":"The cash will be available over the next three months to fill the gap caused by reduced passenger numbers, as the need to remain physically distant continues.The Scottish Government previously offered more than pound million to bus companies in June.:Education Secretary John Swinney faces vote of no confidence over exam shamblesGovernment officials are encouraging people only to travel when they have to, and to avoid peak timesnecessary.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoWhile I will continue to do what I can to support our bus industry and our public transport network, it is important that the public continue to leave space on public transport for those that need it most.ldquoIf you need to travel on public transport, seeyou can avoid peak times and try to plan ahead.

This could be a golden opportunity to re-establish equal delivery costs for islanders –the Chancellor will take these calls seriously.“Almost every family in the Highlands and Islands, myself included, has a story about being overcharged for deliveries. In some cases delivery costs can be even higher than the product itself. Unreasonable charges are a barrier to growth and ease of living. This has to change.”He continued: “Delivery charge inequality affects communities represented by a wide range of parties, from Moray to Unst to Belfast.

Not having the energy they need makes nerves vulnerable to further damage and causes disability over time.Orkney is understood to have the highest rate of MS per capita of anywhere in the world.Researchers—  funded in part by the MS Society – have discovered a natural mechanism in the body that tackles this issue, which they are calling ARMD .The study also suggests that a common diabetes drug could help enhance this new-found natural mechanism – and prevent disability progression in the neurological condition. Although this naturalalone doesn’t provide enough energy to address demyelination in MS, further research in animal models now suggests that pioglitazone –  a drug currently used to treat diabetes – could be the answer. Dr Don Mahad, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Disability in MS is caused by a loss of nerve fibres following damage to the myelin that protects them. #Although our understanding of MS has vastly improved over the last two decades, new therapies still do not protect nerve fibres. Such protection is the Holy Grail in MS treatment — not only for the relapsing form of MS, which has ious options available, but for progressive forms too, where treatment continues to lag behind. “Our discovery shows that nerves respond to myelin damage by increasing the movement of mitochondriato the area of damage — a response we’re calling ‘ARMD’. #Remarkably, we were able to enhance ARMD and protect these vulnerable nerves using the readily available diabetes drug pioglitazone. This is an incredibly important discovery – one we believe could finally bridge the gap in MS treatment.” Over the last few decades there have been huge strides made in our understanding of MS, and there are now over a dozen effective treatments for people with relapsing MS — but these only address damage that is caused by the immune system. In order to truly stop MS and find treatments for everyone, a method of protecting nerves from further injury and repairing damaged myelin needs to be discovered.Last year, another MS Society funded study found that a dferent diabetes drug — the fasting mimetic drug metformin —was able tocells to a more youthful state, and encourage the re-growth of myelin. Led by Professor Robin Franklin, the study found metformin could reverse changes that happen to cells responsible for making myelin as they age, and restore their regenerative capacity. MS Society assistant director of research, Dr Emma Gray, said: “This represents another important stride towards our goal of stopping MS — and we believe that MS treatment could in the near future look completely dferent. #People with MS will be prescribed a combination of therapies that work on every aspect of the condition: stopping immune attacks and relapses, protecting nerves from damage, and regenerating lost myelin. It will mean no-one needs to worry about their MS getting worse.“Currently, there are no effective neuroprotective therapies available for MS, but Dr Mahad’s research demonstrates we are getting closer – and finding treatments for everyone with MS is now a very real prospect.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Care home visiting remains essential visiting indoors only with controlled visiting outside.·        We are advising people who are not in Aberdeen, not to travel there.·        Anyone already in Aberdeen visiting family or on holiday may stay, but they should follow all the guidance and take extra care when theyhome.·        The regulations which stipulate the restrictions on hospitality – and the associated guidance and advice – will be reviewed in seven days.·        We understand the impact these measures will have on iniduals and businesses.·        We would emphasise that where a business has brought staff off furlough, those staff can be re-furloughed, as part of the Jobs Retention Scheme.·        Our precautionary and careful judgement is we need to take decisive action now to try to contain this outbreak and prevent further harm later oncopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The village of Dounby is only slightly older.The story begins with Hosen Market, which was held three times a year at Geoth, north-east of the present village. According to my grandmother, Johina Leith, nee Kirkness, who was born at nearby Newhouse in , and wrote some notes on Dounby, the market began at Hosen in Birsay but drted across the parish boundary to Magz o’Geoth’s ale-house.Grandma was told that, after Magz gave up her ale-house, JosephMackay, who had built the Smithfield Inn, was responsible for the market’s next move.“It would be good for business to have the market near the ale house, so Josie marshalled public opinion into taking up a public subscription to buy a stance nearby with proper title deeds. According to George Wylie, in his book, Showyard on the Heather, , the subscription to buy the land was raised in . But Josie and the market had arrived on that spot almost simultaneously, four years earlier.The West Mainland Agricultural Society was formed in . Two years later, they advertised a Cattle Tryst at Dounby, “for the dispersal of the Best Fat and Grazing Stock of the district.New roads and steamships meant that farmers could export and Dounby Farm, between the main Harray and Birsay road and the new junction road through Sandwick, was the obvious place to sell animals.  is also the year that Josie bought land at the junction from Magnus Smith, owner of Dounby Farm, and built his inn. He married Margaret Davie from Firth in  and by the following year, according to the Orcadian, inn and market were thriving.“The market stance at Dounby, it is believed, is the best in the mainland… It is central and easy of access from all quarters, being held at the intersection of two roads. There is a good and commodious inn on the ground, conducted in a superior manner by Mr and Mrs Mackay, where a iety of refreshments can be had and a rest enjoyed. Sometime in the s, Josie built the larger Smithfield, which held the inn, the Post Office and one or two other businesses over the years. Grandma thought that it was probably the Post Office who fixed the name of Dounby Farm onto the village. It was certainly settled by , when the Dounby Public School opened.The first Dounby Show was held on a field loaned by William Hourie, tenant of Dounby Farm and was a great success. There were over  entries and more than  spectators. I was amazed to find that my g-g-grandfather, Robert Leask of Coldomo, Stenness was one of the prize-winners. It must have been quite an operation to get the animals to the Show then. Grandma had fond memories of the days before cattle trucks.“At one time it was interesting to watch the animals come up from Dounby, past the corner and then turn for Harray, Birsay or Evie, each with their tickets on. At the dinner in the Smithfield Hotel on the evening of the first Show, it was suggested that there should be a Flower and Produce Show and it was held in the Dounby School just six weeks later. After that first year, the two shows were on the same day and the crowds flocked to Dounby.The stock show was held on Dounby Farm until the Society bought five acres of uncultivated land from James Flett of Curcabreck in  and built a wall around it.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier.

The BBC is a  for engagement and debate, but ideas which fall outside the scientic mainstream should be scrutinised and challenged, which did not happen in this instance.A letter of apology was also issued by BBC Northern Ireland#s head of news, Adam Smyth, in response to the complaint.In the letter, Mr Smyth said the BBC#s editorial guidelines in this area have been reinforced with news teams.Newcastle was the scene of a major Covid- cluster in recent days.Three businesses in the town reported outbreaks of the virus among staff this week.One of the businesses Kent Amusements, located on the Central Promenade, announced on social media it was closing until further notice.A Covid- testing unit has been opened at St Mary#s Primary School in Newcastle.Local Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard welcomed the move.He said: I am encouraging anyone in the Newcastle area who has developed COVID- symptoms to avoid contact with others and to urgently get tested for the virus.

Photo Stephen Davison Pacemaker PressBy Adrian RutherfordAugust   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailHealth officials in Northern Ireland will consider local lockdowns to avoid having to close the country down again.Restrictions could be imposed on inidual towns and villages, or even parts of counties, where cases spike.Last night three counties in the Republic were placed back into partial lockdown.Limited restrictions were implemented in Kildare, Laois and Offaly for two weeks from midnight.Taoiseach Micheal Martin said: “There are a number of localised clusters which are a serious concern. We can’t afford to wait and see.”It comes amid mounting concern about the virus in Northern Ireland.On Thursday the Department of Health reported  new cases — the highest daily total since May .Yesterday a further  cases were confirmed.The R number — the virus’s reproductive rate — is estimated to be around ., meaning it is spreading exponentially again.In England and Scotland, health officials have moved to tighten restrictions on towns and cities where cases have surged, including Aberdeen, Leicester and Manchester.And yesterday the Department of Health said similar measures could be taken here. A spokesperson: “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-. In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.”In Kildare, Laois and Offaly, residents will not be allowed to travel outside of their counties except for in limited circumstances, including travel to and from work. Restaurants, bars, cinemas and gyms will be closed.In Northern Ireland, the daily number of coronavirus cases is now around three times the level seen in early July. However, numbers remain well below those recorded earlier in the year. At the height of the crisis in April,  cases were confirmed on one day.Yesterday Prof Young said he did not necessarily expect a spike but added: “I will not be surprisedthe number of cases increase signicantly”.“I certainly hope we do not have to go back to the lockdown and we will do everything possible I’m sure to avoid that evenother measures need to be taken.”Meanwhile, figures published by Northern Ireland’s statistics agency now link  deaths to the virus.Nisra’s weekly bulletin showed there was one death here in the past week where Covid- is thought to have been a factor.Its figures are separate to those collated by the Department of Health, which count mainly hospital deaths.The department’s data is based on deaths where a patient recently tested positive for the virus.Belfast Most ReadI knew the ocean would take him, says grieving son of Brian BlackCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  new cases reportedSwimmer dies after search operation off Co Antrim coastBelfastat : Help us celebrate milestone occasion Pictured: Man arrested in connection with Belfast security alerts released as police urge East Belfast GAA players to check cars,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Northern Ireland Executive announced on Thursday that key groups of pupils willto school from August  while all children should be back in class by September.Revised New School Day guidance will be published next week setting out an updated approach to the full reopening of schools.Read More All children to be back in school by September – NI ExecutiveTrade union Unison - which represents more than , education workers - says the school reopening plan is causing anxiety among its members.Another trade union - Unite - has threatened legal actionthe Northern Ireland Executive does not give further assurances about the safety of bus drivers when schools .A Unison spokeswoman said on Friday night: We have been engaged in continuous joint union discussions with the department and education bodies on a pilot plan for the safeof children and workers alike. That plan has now been set aside for what appear to be political rather than public health reasons.Like everyone  we want to see our schools reopen but our members and our school children cannot be put at risk.The latest ministerial announcement is causing anxiety for parents, pupils and education staff.Unite spokesman Michael Dornan told BBC Radio Ulster#s Talkback programme on Friday that he was greatly concerned about guidance in place to protect Translink school bus drivers.The union has arranged an emergency meeting on Monday with Translink senior management to discuss their concerns.He said: About four weeks ago, when social distancing was reduced and more passengers were allowed on board the Transport Minister Nichola Mallon added additional protection by making face masks mandatory.We have yet to hear of any guidance from the education minister about additional protection [for bus drivers].He added: It is very, very concerning for us and we would be forced to take some form of mandatory action in order to bring this to the attention of the education [Department] and Translink.We want to see what the added protection the education minister is coming up with. We want to see how the driver deals with children boarding buses. We want to know how we deal with older children - should they be wearing masks, should they not be wearing masks Mr Dornan said Unite could seek to challenge the government legally or industrially.If the risk increases for drivers they could possibly refuse to do it, he added.Responding on Friday night, Minister for Education Peter Weir said: We are still operating in a pandemic and we all have a vital role to play in ensuring that hygiene and public health measures are adhered to by all to allow our children and young people a safeto education.I am confident that our school leaders and staff will rise to the challenge and ensure all pupils cansafely to education full-time.A Translink spokeswoman said: We are working closely with the relevant agencies to make arrangements for school transport ahead of the new school term, ensuring adherence to Government guidelines. We will also follow guidance from the Department of Education, which is due to be published next week.

But most of all we need the public to support our industry.Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industryhas set our six ways of coping in the event of a local lockdown.The organisation#s Northern Ireland director Angela McGowan it#s about building confidencenew temporary restrictions are implemented.Businesses know thatinfection rates spike in an area then new local lockdowns may well be required to protect public health, she said.Local lockdowns are how governments manage the risk of infection and reopening the economy safely, so we must get good at them. The local Executive will need to act fast on new information, so there may be limited notice, but we must aim for a #no surprises# approach as far as possible.

There are a two distinct political jurisdictions born out of the Good Friday Agreement - we have acknowledge the reality of that, Mr Martin said. However, the Taoiseach said what happens in Britain impacts in Ireland and noted that English nationalism was the driving force behind the successful Brexit referendum and added that Scotland may some day break away from the UK.  What happensEngland gets turned off Northern Ireland  We#ve got to be thinking all this through, he added.This prompted Mrs Foster to denounce the comments, remarking that the rest of the UK cannot sever its constitutional links with Northern Ireland, pointing out that a united Ireland can only be achieved with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, as outlined in the Belfast Agreement.

It does not threaten our constitutional position or what we believe in so I don#t feel threatened at all by the shared island unit, she explained.TUV leader Jim Allister was critical of her remarks, insisting it would be unwise for unionism to adopt her laissez-faire response to the Taoiseach#s Shared Island Unit.Speaking on Friday, Mr Allister said the plans by Dublin and nationalist parties for a united Ireland need to be taken seriously by unionists and countered.The pandemic has demonstrated the benefits of Northern Ireland#s place in the UK, he added.Unionism needs to be proactively countering the arguments of nationalism about the future, not ignoring them or dismissing them out of hand. Even the name of Mr Martin#s new unit displays the narrow vision of nationalism.Why does Mr Martin not accept that perhaps the way to share the island of Ireland is to accept the repeatedly expressed will of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK Belfast Most ReadI knew the ocean would take him, says grieving son of Brian BlackCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  new cases reportedSwimmer dies after search operation off Co Antrim coastBelfastat : Help us celebrate milestone occasion Pictured: Man arrested in connection with Belfast security alerts released as police urge East Belfast GAA players to check cars,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The young people of Northern Ireland in  were invited to pen a short essay detailing their hopes and dreams for peace and harmony in the future - and what NI would look like in the future.. At the time, -year-old Valerie McCambley, winner of second prize in the - age group, won a £ voucher which she said she would be putting towards a trip abroad with school the following year. “We must realise now before it is too late, that we are tomorrow’s Ulster,” wrote Valerie. “We must affirm that  is now for our history books, but  is for us.”Meanwhile, Jeffrey Nelson, from Belfast, wrote that he “would like to see Ulster full of happy people who have nice homes and who live in peace with their neighbours”.He said he was going to buy an Action Man with “real hair” with his £ consolation voucher. As we gear up to celebrate  years of publication, the Belfastwould love to hear from those past competition winners to find out what they make of Ulster in  - how they ended up spending their voucher.

It was compassion - a compassion that bubbled over in the cemetery in Greysteel that drove John on the final and often lonely and always dficult road to peace.Fr Farren said this desire to create peace came at a heavy cost.He added: Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others. His vision revealed what could be and with time and determination and single-mindedness and stubbornness he convinced others that peace could be a reality. He never lost faith in peace and he never lost faith in his ability to convince others that peace was the only way.

Ulster Unionist Party councillors on Belfast City Council Jim Rodgers and Sonia Copeland have criticised Sinn Fein Councillor Ronan McLaughlin over his comments that Roselawn cemetery is unwelcoming for Roman Catholics.There is not a grain of truth in this statement, the two councillors said on Friday.Last week, Belfast Sinn Fein councillor Ronan McLaughlin told a Belfast City Council meeting that the city#s nationalist and republican community believes that the Roselawn cemetery and crematorium is not a welcome place for them.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRonan McLaughlin of Sinn Fein FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappRonan McLaughlin of Sinn FeinCouncillor McLaughlin made the remarks as he requested an additional equality assessment into plans to locate Northern Ireland#s second crematorium in Roselawn, close to the existing one.A second facility for the site is planned, with an estimated cost in the region £m, and which it#s expected will take up to two years to build. The existing building - which is listed - will be refurbished inside and used by staff.At a meeting of the council#s strategic policy and resources committee meeting, Councillor McLaughlin said: What we have seen recently in Roselawn is the display of what can only be described as a hate banner that was very sectarian in nature.Me and my party colleagues have had people contacting us, families of recently deceased people, who are concerned about Roselawn.There is a perception within the Catholic, nationalist, republican community that Roselawn is not a welcome place for them. It#s our job to address that. We have even spoken to staff members working at Roselawn who are trying to get more information from the council and who are worried about going into their jobs on a daily basis, Councillor McLaughlin said.However, the two east Belfast Ulster Unionist councillors rejected Councillor McLaughlin#s remarks, saying the Roselawn facility is open to all sections of the community - and always has been.Thousands of people have been buried as well as cremated in Roselawn since it opened in the early sixties.

At his father’s funeral yesterday, a message was read out on behalf of Aidan Hume in which he said the university campaign served as a catalyst for his father’s career in politics. In , the Lockwood report recommended that Northern Irelands second university be sited in Coleraine rather than Derry. It was viewed as a controversial decision at the time and highly contested in the city. That same year a cross-community campaign was led by John Hume, the unionist mayor Albert Anderson and Eddie McAteer, leader of the Nationalist Party. googletag.cmd.push At yesterday’s funeral a message was delivered by Hume’s daughter, Mo, on behalf of her brother Aidan who couldn’t travel from the United States due to the coronavirus pandemic. In it, Aidan said that using a moral compass as his only tether his father’s ‘perseverance and sheer will’ brought ‘hope and history’ together. “It began with the corrupt siting of the university, driven by a total lack of respect for ersity,’ he added. The university campaign acted as a prelude to the civil rights movement and was part of a building of frustrations felt by Derry people. Ultimately the protest had no impact on the final decision but it may have saved Magee campus, which had been earmarked for closure. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann, civil rights veteran and former neighbour of Hume, believes it was the university campaign that set the tone for the former SDLP leader’s style of politics in the decades to come. At this stage people will be familiar with the motorcade to Stormont in protest over Lockwoods decision, he added. But he says, as signicant, was a Guildhall Square rally ‘jammed with people’ where a youthful John Hume spoke not of ‘unionist discrimination’ but of the need for ‘togetherness’ to bring about reform. “There really you have the microcosm of his politics and strategy for the rest of his le, it was all there.” In  a Peace and Conflict Studies course was formed at the Magee campus in Derry, an internationally renowned programme offered by leading academics from the International Conflict Research Institute . In recognition of Hume’s peace-building efforts, Ulster University announced funding for the John Hume and Thomas P. ONeill Chair in Peace, to be established at the Magee campus. Set up in honour of both politicians, the Chair is a full-time academic position in peace and conflict resolution studies which helps to train the next generation of peacemakers from around the world. Presidents and leaders from around the world, including Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama, spoke to audiences at the campus. However, there was widespread concern in Derry when a decision was made to relocate the course to Belfast a number of years ago. ‘JOHN’S VISION’ Current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that throughout his le, John Hume stood up for Derry and all its people. “He understood the transformative impact of education and knew all too well the structural inequalities forced upon the people of this city,” he said. “John campaigned for university provision in Derry that could deliver the skills and opportunities our people need to grow and prosper, even against the backdrop of a campaign of violence that plagued the lives of those in the city. “Delivering on John’s vision for Derry is a priority for me and for the SDLP. I am committed to ensuring that everyone in this city has the opportunity to make a live for themselves here. “Johns lasting legacy should be that we never allow our young people to be raised for export. Derry needs a full-scale university, nothing  will meet the needs of our people.” Meanwhile, the Derry University Groupwhich has been lobbying for an independent university in the city described John Hume as one of the greatest educators and thinkers the city has known since Colmcille. GarbhaacutenDowney of the DUG said: “He taught us of the importance of a university as a centre of learning, industry, science and arts, heritage, philosophy and discourse as the focal point for community engagement, and the lead agent for positive change and self-empowerment “He worked throughout his career to establish a university here to serve as the bedrock for the new, peaceful society of equals, which he had envisaged for Derry from his earliest days as a social champion. “The campaign to build a university, begun by John Hume sixty years ago, is still unfinished. It has been described as the last remaining civil rights issue. “There could be no more fitting legacy to John Hume than for his home city to finish this job now.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real ision of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.” It is hard to describe John Hume as anything but a Hero. His building of a lasting and sustainable peace in Ireland is why he shall be immortalised in history. John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real ision of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.” It is hard to describe John Hume as anything but a Hero. His building of a lasting and sustainable peace in Ireland is why he shall be immortalised in history. John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score.

Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the .

When he tossed a ball in the direction of his six year-old son Barry in the back garden, Barrys reaction was the watershed moment. Instead of catching the ball, he opted to put out his chest. Soccer was his first instinct andColeraine were going to take the first step out of junior football, teaching the basic components, as early as possible, was the priority. Otherwise soccer was always going to have first call on the youth of the Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush triangle. googletag.cmd.push Fast forward  years and Barry would develop into a wing-forward and top scorer on Derrys  All-Ireland winning minor team and play at senior level for the county.   “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it.” SEAN McGOLDRICK  Richard Carey and Mark McTaggart were other future senior championship winners to go through Coleraines first underage coaching initiative. Armed with long-serving Kevin Mullan, Vinty McMahon and Brian Daly – whose son Barry scored the winning goal in the  final against Lavey – Sean set to work in Dominican College. It had to start somewhere. googletag.cmd.push “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it,” McGoldrick said in an interview before the  decider. What Coleraine have achieved with their persistence is nothing short of magnicent. And not against a backdrop of GAA tradition in the area, but one they grew themselves. The hub of it is the McGoldrick family who have formed the spine of teams, but imagine what could be done with the numbers in Derry City. Then again there are not many people in the world like Sean McGoldrick. This column has previously highlighted the lack of players to play senior football for Derry from outside the top flight. Of the  players, in the last  years, only  hail from non-senior clubs. From the city point of view, only Neil Forester, Eoghan Concannon and Ben McCarron from the city have played for the county at senior level. Thats a very sobering thought. Is all the money being invested worth it  You would have to wonder. It is dficult to break the mould against soccer, but more recently it is a totally dferent issue. Many young people in the city are not involved in any sport and the once vibrant Derry and District soccer league has been struggling. Whether we like it or not, unless the city can be properly harnessed then Derry, as a county, are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the superpowers who are challenging for Sam. The college scene in the county is vibrant, with teams challenging for titles on a regular basis. St Patricks Maghera have led the way for years. St Marys Magherafelt – while having a signicant Tyrone and Antrim representation – have given Derry players a chance to play at a high level. St Pius had qualied for the MacLarnon final. St Colms Draperstown have been punching above their weight - despite picking from two clubs - and St Patricks and Brigids Claudy played in U finals. In Derry City, St Columbs Derry had a strong spine of boarders on their  Hogan Cup winning team. In more recent times, it has always had key players from outlying clubs Claudy and Craigbane. A worrying trend is that, apart from their MacLarnon team, the rest of the younger teams are playing at Grade C level in the new Ulster Schools format. A more recent development has been Cathair Dhoire, the amalgamation team in the city, which gave players in the city a taste of MacRory Cup football. The beauty of the Ulster Schools scene is that players can play at a higher level than they are getting at their club, often at a time when their club team is idle and against players from all over Ulster. It is a great bridge to county minor level. Any school coach I speak to, the first people they credit for success are the coaches in the feeder clubs. At the end of the day, a school just polishes the players and mould them into a team. If, as expected, money becomes available for Derry City to follow what Dublin, and more recently Belfast, are doing then it needs to be used wisely. Every penny that becomes available should be ploughed into getting the highest standard of GAA coaching into primary schools. Not concrete or infrastructure, with Doire Trasna now having their own pitch, coaching should be the only focus. Conrad McGuigan is a teacher in a city school and from a conversation I had with him lately, participation has never been higher. In the last six years the number of teams in the Tower Cup has risen from five to . He rated some of their players skills as every bit as good as what there is in his native Craigbane and surrounding clubs. The raw material is there. There has been a decline in the number of males going into the primary teaching profession andprincipals have extra people coming in to coach GAA as a key component of the schools PE curriculum, it has to be music to their ears. For me, the deal-breaker is accountability. To avail of the coaching, a primary school must have a link to the local club. No link, no deal. And it has to be done properly and a stringent review taken place every year. It wouldnt be hard to cross check names from the school teams with club records and eventually U team sheets. Any school or club not pulling their weight simply gets omitted from the funding. Money cannot be wasted on just ticking a box. There is no point in players learning all the skills and not transferring it to a club. Thats where the real gains are. A player who canpush for the countyminorteamandhave a  plus year club senior career. A rising tide lts all boats and the cream will eventually creep into the senior inter-county scene. Any new plan for the city will be the last throw of the dice at engaging a population base that could transform Derry as a county. It will take time, but unless it isproperly audited there is no point.

When he tossed a ball in the direction of his six year-old son Barry in the back garden, Barrys reaction was the watershed moment. Instead of catching the ball, he opted to put out his chest. Soccer was his first instinct andColeraine were going to take the first step out of junior football, teaching the basic components, as early as possible, was the priority. Otherwise soccer was always going to have first call on the youth of the Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush triangle. googletag.cmd.push Fast forward  years and Barry would develop into a wing-forward and top scorer on Derrys  All-Ireland winning minor team and play at senior level for the county.   “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it.” SEAN McGOLDRICK  Richard Carey and Mark McTaggart were other future senior championship winners to go through Coleraines first underage coaching initiative. Armed with long-serving Kevin Mullan, Vinty McMahon and Brian Daly – whose son Barry scored the winning goal in the  final against Lavey – Sean set to work in Dominican College. It had to start somewhere. googletag.cmd.push “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it,” McGoldrick said in an interview before the  decider. What Coleraine have achieved with their persistence is nothing short of magnicent. And not against a backdrop of GAA tradition in the area, but one they grew themselves. The hub of it is the McGoldrick family who have formed the spine of teams, but imagine what could be done with the numbers in Derry City. Then again there are not many people in the world like Sean McGoldrick. This column has previously highlighted the lack of players to play senior football for Derry from outside the top flight. Of the  players, in the last  years, only  hail from non-senior clubs. From the city point of view, only Neil Forester, Eoghan Concannon and Ben McCarron from the city have played for the county at senior level. Thats a very sobering thought. Is all the money being invested worth it  You would have to wonder. It is dficult to break the mould against soccer, but more recently it is a totally dferent issue. Many young people in the city are not involved in any sport and the once vibrant Derry and District soccer league has been struggling. Whether we like it or not, unless the city can be properly harnessed then Derry, as a county, are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the superpowers who are challenging for Sam. The college scene in the county is vibrant, with teams challenging for titles on a regular basis. St Patricks Maghera have led the way for years. St Marys Magherafelt – while having a signicant Tyrone and Antrim representation – have given Derry players a chance to play at a high level. St Pius had qualied for the MacLarnon final. St Colms Draperstown have been punching above their weight - despite picking from two clubs - and St Patricks and Brigids Claudy played in U finals. In Derry City, St Columbs Derry had a strong spine of boarders on their  Hogan Cup winning team. In more recent times, it has always had key players from outlying clubs Claudy and Craigbane. A worrying trend is that, apart from their MacLarnon team, the rest of the younger teams are playing at Grade C level in the new Ulster Schools format. A more recent development has been Cathair Dhoire, the amalgamation team in the city, which gave players in the city a taste of MacRory Cup football. The beauty of the Ulster Schools scene is that players can play at a higher level than they are getting at their club, often at a time when their club team is idle and against players from all over Ulster. It is a great bridge to county minor level. Any school coach I speak to, the first people they credit for success are the coaches in the feeder clubs. At the end of the day, a school just polishes the players and mould them into a team. If, as expected, money becomes available for Derry City to follow what Dublin, and more recently Belfast, are doing then it needs to be used wisely. Every penny that becomes available should be ploughed into getting the highest standard of GAA coaching into primary schools. Not concrete or infrastructure, with Doire Trasna now having their own pitch, coaching should be the only focus. Conrad McGuigan is a teacher in a city school and from a conversation I had with him lately, participation has never been higher. In the last six years the number of teams in the Tower Cup has risen from five to . He rated some of their players skills as every bit as good as what there is in his native Craigbane and surrounding clubs. The raw material is there. There has been a decline in the number of males going into the primary teaching profession andprincipals have extra people coming in to coach GAA as a key component of the schools PE curriculum, it has to be music to their ears. For me, the deal-breaker is accountability. To avail of the coaching, a primary school must have a link to the local club. No link, no deal. And it has to be done properly and a stringent review taken place every year. It wouldnt be hard to cross check names from the school teams with club records and eventually U team sheets. Any school or club not pulling their weight simply gets omitted from the funding. Money cannot be wasted on just ticking a box. There is no point in players learning all the skills and not transferring it to a club. Thats where the real gains are. A player who canpush for the countyminorteamandhave a  plus year club senior career. A rising tide lts all boats and the cream will eventually creep into the senior inter-county scene. Any new plan for the city will be the last throw of the dice at engaging a population base that could transform Derry as a county. It will take time, but unless it isproperly audited there is no point. If they can squeeze every drop of potential like Coleraine did, it would be a serious addition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Galliaghs St Pio House will be run by the Franciscan Friars, who have been collecting donations through an online Go Fund Me page, music events and a huge raffle. Based at the former St Josephs Parish Centre, it will be a place where theFriarscan carry out their work and welcome the local community. The extensive renovations have been funded by a number of benefactors, but the final pound, needed to complete the project was raised by the people of Derry in less than a month. googletag.cmd.push A team of volunteers have been going door to door across the city in recent weeks to collect money and explain the work of the centre, which will be opened on Wednesday, September , on the Feast Day of St Pio. Speaking on the Derry Franciscans Facebook page Fr Isaac Spinharney thanked everyone who helped them meet their fundraising goal. I want to thank every single person who donated to our Go Fund Me campaign over the last month, it was just actually four weeks, contributing to the near completion of this beautul house. Thank you so much for your generosity, its overwhelming and amazing.” googletag.cmd.push He continued: Thank you also to our volunteers. We had a solid crew of five to  who went out six days a week for about three or four weeks. We are truly grateful we could not do it without you. Fr Isaac explained how St Pio House will operate. There will be a coffee bar which will be a house of hospitality people can come and connect with their neighbours and connect with God over a cup of coffee or maybe a cup of tea. We are going to be able to host retreats and have a Praise and Worship Centre and have dferent parish activities and community activities over the months and years. Speaking to the Derry News last month, Fr Issac said the work of the new Apolistic Centre will be guided by the needs of the local community. In the  years that we have been here we have able to plug into the already existing groups and we have been so blessed to be a part of them. People have asked what sort of services will be available but we will see what needs present themselves. And we will continue to work with the organisations that we are already closely working with.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, said concerns had been raised by constituents whose requests for their license renewals to be issued in Irish were not honoured. “The right to have your details printed in Irish on your licence is protected within the European Charter for Regional and Minority languages,” she said. “Following the commitment to an Irish Language Act within New Decade, New Approach, I would have hoped that the use of Irish on official documents would be encouraged within agencies, as opposed to prevented. googletag.cmd.push “I was contacted by a family who had applied for their licence renewals to reflect their fluency in the language, and to have their names and addresses in Irish on their Photographic licences, and was concerned that their demand had not been acted upon by DVA staff. “A driving licence, like any official ID, is often a source of pride and an opportunity to express ourselves. “It is therefore key that citizens have their identity expressed as they wish on theirlicence, not as another would interpret it.” The Department of Infrastructure has confirmed applicants may request their name in Irish on their license. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson said: “An applicant for, or holder of, a Northern Ireland driving licence may, at any time, request that their name appears in traditional form. “Such a request does not constitute a change of name and the applicant or holder is not required to provide identity documentation bearing the name in Irish. “Where an applicant for, or holder of, a Northern Ireland driving licence requests that the address is displayed in Irish, such a request will be met provided the relevant council confirms that the street name has been legally adopted. “Currently this does not extend to other addresses.It was agreed in New Decade New Approach that the Executive Office would bring forward language legislation and appoint a Commissioner to protect and enhance use of the Irish language. “It is important that this legislation is brought forward as soon as possible, and I will seek to ensure that my department plays its role and fulfils its commitments.” Ms Sheerin welcomed the Department’s response and clarication. She said: “I am delighted that the minister has written to me to confirm that this was an error, and that the department understand it is a persons right to have their name printed in Irish. “Where their council has a street sign policy in place which has legally adopted their street or road into Irish, they are entitled to have their address displayed as such.” Ms Sheerin also confirmed the constituents had now received their licenses with their names printed in Irish.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A delivery van was hijacked at Rathlin Drive in the estate on Tuesday afternoon before being set on fire. It was one of three vehicles hijacked in Derry on Tuesday. Local politicians condemned the hijackings and said they had destroyed the livelihoods of the workers involved. Community workers today said there were widespread concerns about the attacks in Creggan this week. In a joint statement, Conal McFeely, Tony O’Doherty, Shauna Deery and Gerry Quinn of Creggan Neighbourhood Partnershipsaid there were also concerns about police activity in Creggan which included, they said, house raids, stop and search tactics and other disruption activity by the TSG   TIU . googletag.cmd.push “We, as the community, need to listen and to speak out, to ensure that everyone fully understands the negative consequences of such events and the social, economic and reputational damage to iniduals, families and the wider community,” the statement said. “Creggan has been fully compliant to public health guidance, and extremely resilient and considerate during the Covid lockdown – an exemplar in how a community should respond to a crisis. “According to current statistics, this area has among the lowest reported crime figures in the city and, contrary to the widely-reported, albeit ill-informed, perception, Creggan is in fact a very safe and caring community. googletag.cmd.push “The last number of weeks, however, have seen a number of serious incidents which we believe require further investigation. “CNP believe there is an underlying context to this week’s disturbances, which has gone largely unreported and hence has, again, led to a very one-sided picture of this area being portrayed.” The community workers said young people and families had told them that they are being deliberately targeted by highly aggressive, frightening and quasi-legal policing procedures tactics. “And it is incumbent on us, as a socially-just community, to take account of all available evidence, to establish a full and fair perspective of the situation. “CNP in no way condone or excuse the activities leading to the physical, mental and reputational damage done by, or to, any person or property in this community. “We are aware, however, that there is a specic context to recent events – this response did not happen out of nowhere. “And we also believe that there is a responsibility on all of us to examine that context and engage with young people and local residents – both to listen to their concerns and to ensure that they understand the extremely negative consequences of the destruction of community or private property, and the knock-on affects in relation to the traumatic impacts on affected iniduals and the denial of public services to the area. “There is a growing concern about the ‘cause and effect’ nature of ongoing police activity in the area and recent community disturbances. “Many within this community believe that current police actions only serve to undermine public confidence in policing and indeed the independence and effectiveness of the local and regional police oversight bodies which are supposed to hold police to account. “Our public representatives and church leaders should be concerned, and not be afraid to speak out, about how our area is being policed and is being impacted by the resulting destruction of community or private property.” The Creggan community workers said that following a process of mediation with relevant groupings, it has been established that there is no impediment to the resumption of all delivery and maintenance services in the area. “Tensions are high in the area at the moment – there is a great deal of hurt and frustration which needs to be acknowledged and the specic reasons for these sentiments need to be explored. “CNP believe there is a critical need for an independent review of the recent disturbances – and their context – and will engage inclusively with the entire community to ensure that any such process will be as fair and transparent as possible.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He noticed that for special occasions people in the city rush out to buy a personalised cake from Doherty’s Bakery and thought why not also give them a special memento they can hold on to forever. Christopher Ferry is a Derry man with over  years’ experience in the design industry. He has won ious awards in that time for graphic design and social media management through his work with local businesses. Being on furlough at the moment and confined to his home during lockdown, he felt there was no time like the present to kickstart his own business, aptly named Ferry Clever. googletag.cmd.push It allows people to personalise cards or buy those with famous Derry faces for every occasion. A host of Maiden City icons appear on cards such as John Hume, Nadine Coyle, Micky Doherty , Pat Ramsey and places such as Free Derry Corner, the City Walls and, of course, The Ice Wharf.  Most of them are accompanied by local sayings, for example the common phrase ‘I love you to the moon and back’ is given a local spin to read, ‘I love you to the Bog and back’, with a sketch of the Bogside as the backdrop. It is not just cards but personalised images that can be framed, with a Liverpool-themed design currently proving popular after they were crowned Premier League champions. googletag.cmd.push Families can customise an image of them standing outside the Shankly Gates where it says ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. The business has been built at home but Christopher’s ambition is to eventually open a shop in the city centre where the tagline will be ‘make it personal’. Working as a DJ he has established relationships with numerous bars and businesses in the town. “Years and years ago they seen me doing the designs for my own posters, this was back when social media was starting to explode, and they asked meI fancied doing posters for them. “I’d do everything from menus printed in their premises, posters, social media campaigns, to online videos – the lot. “But now I want to go full pelt at it and open my own business.” Recently he was in the town looking for a Father’s Day card and couldn’t find any he liked.  He said: “I thought it would be greatyou could just go on to some place and they could make the card for you. “So I thought, you know what, I’m going to try this as well.” He started off selling on the website Etsy and sales have been rising, ‘people are just buying the cards flat to the mat at the minute’, he added. As someone who is social media savvy, he has been keeping an eye on trends and designing cards accordingly. During lockdown the charity work of local celebrity Micky Doherty was well publicised which is why his image was selected to grace one of the cards.  The ultimate ambition for Christopher is to be the ‘go-to person’ whenever a special occasion comes up. “In Derry, and all over the world, it’s always going to be someone’s birthday, it’s always going to be Christmas, it’s always going to be Father’s Day so I just want them thinking of me for a card.” Micky Doherty said he loved the cards. “Im totally honoured,” he said. “Like someone wants a birthday card with my face on it, he laughed.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He noticed that for special occasions people in the city rush out to buy a personalised cake from Doherty’s Bakery and thought why not also give them a special memento they can hold on to forever. Christopher Ferry is a Derry man with over  years’ experience in the design industry. He has won ious awards in that time for graphic design and social media management through his work with local businesses. Being on furlough at the moment and confined to his home during lockdown, he felt there was no time like the present to kickstart his own business, aptly named Ferry Clever. googletag.cmd.push It allows people to personalise cards or buy those with famous Derry faces for every occasion. A host of Maiden City icons appear on cards such as John Hume, Nadine Coyle, Micky Doherty , Pat Ramsey and places such as Free Derry Corner, the City Walls and, of course, The Ice Wharf.  Most of them are accompanied by local sayings, for example the common phrase ‘I love you to the moon and back’ is given a local spin to read, ‘I love you to the Bog and back’, with a sketch of the Bogside as the backdrop. It is not just cards but personalised images that can be framed, with a Liverpool-themed design currently proving popular after they were crowned Premier League champions. googletag.cmd.push Families can customise an image of them standing outside the Shankly Gates where it says ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. The business has been built at home but Christopher’s ambition is to eventually open a shop in the city centre where the tagline will be ‘make it personal’. Working as a DJ he has established relationships with numerous bars and businesses in the town. “Years and years ago they seen me doing the designs for my own posters, this was back when social media was starting to explode, and they asked meI fancied doing posters for them. “I’d do everything from menus printed in their premises, posters, social media campaigns, to online videos – the lot. “But now I want to go full pelt at it and open my own business.” Recently he was in the town looking for a Father’s Day card and couldn’t find any he liked.  He said: “I thought it would be greatyou could just go on to some place and they could make the card for you. “So I thought, you know what, I’m going to try this as well.” He started off selling on the website Etsy and sales have been rising, ‘people are just buying the cards flat to the mat at the minute’, he added. As someone who is social media savvy, he has been keeping an eye on trends and designing cards accordingly. During lockdown the charity work of local celebrity Micky Doherty was well publicised which is why his image was selected to grace one of the cards.  The ultimate ambition for Christopher is to be the ‘go-to person’ whenever a special occasion comes up. “In Derry, and all over the world, it’s always going to be someone’s birthday, it’s always going to be Christmas, it’s always going to be Father’s Day so I just want them thinking of me for a card.” Micky Doherty said he loved the cards. “Im totally honoured,” he said. “Like someone wants a birthday card with my face on it, he laughed.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Regularly setting top  times throughout the event, the -year-old and co-driver Keaton Williams soon got to grips with the unique Italian roads, to complete their first event since March’s Covid- lockdown halted all rallying in Ireland and the UK. The duo also upheld Irish honours at the event, with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy entering two drivers on the event which saw no less than  Hyundai i R’s tackle the event, joining World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville in their i Coupe WRC’s. googletag.cmd.push Like most aspiring young rally drivers, McErlean’s season was decimated by the Covid- outbreak and had his  plans quashed by the cancellation of the British Rally Championship earlier in the year. After a tricky opening round of the BRC in Wales in which the  Junior BRC champion impressed onlookers with a string of top five times, he was eager toto the stages and thanks to the help of the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing, a deal was done to head to Italy for Rally di Alba. Although McErlean, the current Billy Coleman Award winner, had technically competed in Italy before, at the Monza Rally Show, the event would mark his first closed road event in the Hyundai outside of Ireland and with over  kilometers of special stages ahead, McErlean would need to focus all his energy on theto competitive action. googletag.cmd.push A loop of three stages would be repeated three times and whilst becoming more familiar with the stages would inevitably assist McErlean, the loose gravel and rocks pulled onto the stages with each pass offered an additional hazard, especially towards the closing stages of the rally.After a positive pre-event Shakedown on Saturday, McErlean was eager to settle into a comfortable rhythm on the stages in his Michelin shod Hyundai and opened his account with an impressive thoverall stage time on the first test of the event with many experienced Italian crews behind. His form continued throughout the opening loop to land thoverall after three stages. Fourteenth fastest on the fourth counter was a highlight and an indication of just how well McErlean was bedding into the Italian roads, climbing one place to thin the process. Sadly, a technical issue on the fth stage meant he and Williams would have to carry out roadside repairs to the i R before heading into the sixth test. Those repairs would eat into his road section time, handing him an unfortunate -second penalty before he was able to attempt the stage. Luckily McErlean was able to nurse the i back to service where the Philip Case Rallysport team worked against the clock to get the Hyundai back to full health. A mature drive over the final three stages saw McErlean further cement his position toto Alba with an impressive top twenty result. “I’m delighted to have reached the finish today and although it wasn’t entirely trouble-free, I really enjoyed the experience, it was a real honour to compete on such a fantastic occasion and with an amazing atmosphere,”said McErlean. “We came here with a clear goal to get experience and build the pace throughout the rally and I feel we did just that. Analysing the times and considering the lack of experience in Italy it was very much mission accomplished throughout the weekend and without the time penalty, the result would have been as good as I could wish for. I’m happy with the way both Keaton and I managed the situation we found ourselves in and got the job done on the way to the sixth test to enable us to carry on. Resilience and thinking on your feet are a key focus of the Motorsport Rally Academy so we were very able to put that into practice. The pace this weekend shows that I`m heading very much in the right direction and I am eager to make more plans to take that forward during the remainder of the season. I’d like to thank all our backers, Sean McHugh and John Coyne from the MI Rally Academy, Andrew Johns from Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing and Tim Hoare from Michelin for all their invaluable support once again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours.

Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption.

heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement

being sought for two poultry houses for almost , chickens at an established Moy Park poultry farm, with the planned development considered necessary in order to facilitate additional bird capacity

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness.

Photo: Press Eye PA WireThe scale of support required to help firms deal with the paperwork is testament to how serious the barriers to trade and business will become now that Northern Ireland is to be left behind as a colony of the EU, semi-detached from the rest of the nation.As for Mr Gove’s claims that this package underscores Westminster’s “absolute commitment” to Northern Ireland those who heard him and other members of the government loudly and repeatedly deny that an Irish Sea border would ever be accepted will understandably treat the comments with contempt.Yesterday’s announcement is bad news for everyone in Northern Ireland. Regardless of your stance on the constitutional question, the erection of a border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain means you will be hit in the pocket in the months and years ahead.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It makes no economic sense. Far from yesterday’s announcement displaying a commitment to Northern Ireland it underscores a historic betrayal of this part of the United Kingdom.The fact that the DUP DAERA minister, despite his previous affirmations to the contrary, is now overseeing the imposition of the Irish Sea Border infrastructure at our ports, adds to the sense of betrayal that I as a unionist feel.The evaporation of opposition to the Betrayal Act by those in a position to take a stand, through the governmental positions they hold, is a great disappointment and disservice to future generations.Just last week we saw north southery turbocharged while the wedge of an Irish Sea border Is driven through the east west links. Arlene Foster declared her sanguinity to the Dublin government’s ‘shared island unit’ while the Republic’s Prime Minister made clear today its purpose is to anticipate a break-up of the UK. History, from a unionist perspective, will not judge kindly those at both a national and local level who facilitated and whitewashed the catastrophic consequences of the Betrayal Act.Jim Allister QC MLA, Stormont——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since ing to site Farrans, the contractor in charge of the build, has ensured the contract is completed ready for opening in the Autumn.Farrans has been spearheading the build since initial enabling works got under way early in , creating  jobs on site during construction as part of a project which has delivered at least £. million in direct wages to the local economy.Located at the south side of Craigavon’s balancing lake, the facility is a landmark venue for the area and is situated within a pre-existing network of walking and cycling paths covering around three miles. The council hopes the new leisure centre will welcome visitors from across the borough and beyond to its new -metre pool, a young children’s indoor leisure water feature, a ,m state-of-the-art gym, multiple studios, health and wellbeing suite, sensory room, eight-court sports halls, spin studio, soft play area and an on-site café.It also incorporates an outdoor water sports provision offering a wide range of water based activities including windsurfing, water skiing and paddle sports. The council says the scale of South Lake Leisure Centre has been future-proofed to meet the needs of a growing population and a raising demand from a range of leisure, amateur and professional sporting enthusiasts.Lord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Councillor Kevin Savage, sai: “With a confirmed opening date just  weeks away, I am delighted that this stunning new centre - which will have fabulous facilities for everyone in the borough to access and enjoy - is almost complete.“South Lake Leisure Centre provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform and dramatically enhance the quality of health and leisure provision within the borough, providing community access for everyone to the best facilities available in the UK and Ireland.”As part of the preparations for the official opening of South Lake Leisure Centre, interim arrangements have been agreed for leisure facilities in Portadownand Brownlow . Cascades Leisure Complex will be open to the public for lane swimming only in August, remaining open until Saturday th October.Craigavon Leisure Centre will remain open to the public for gym only until Monday th October. Waves Leisure Complex will be closed to the public.When all these facilities, which are approaching the end of their al le close, leisure staff will begin their training at the new South Lake Leisure

in pipelineA major new chain store is on its way to Lurgan and could bring  jobs to the town, a local councillor has said.By The NewsroomFriday, th August , : pmUpdated Friday, th August , : pm\"\"The application, lodged by applicant Inaltus Ltd on behalf of Curly Properties Ltd is for a retail development with car parking, landscaping, access and associated site works developed atvacant lands north of Millennium Way, Lurgan.Originally submitted in  the planning proposal has been recommended for approval by Council’s planning officers and will,approved, see Home Bargains arrive in town.Speaking in support of the application, Councillor Joe Nelson said it would bring “signicant economic benefits… including some  new jobs” to Lurgan.“I believe the site location is ideal for this development as it provides adequate car parking in situ and is located on Millenium Way which is in fact the relief road for Lurgan Town Centre,” say the SDLP councillor.“Bringing this development to the town while keeping the town centre free from extra congestion is the ideal position.“I strongly support these proposals and trust that the material considerations, associated with the economic and other benefits of the scheme, will be considered in detail by the Council planners.”Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley has expressed “strong support” for the application.“The proposals will see the delivery of a Home Bargains store for Lurgan along with signicant economic benefits including a multi-million pound investment into the local economy and the creation of some  new jobs,” said the DUP MLA“At a time when many people are losing their jobs and many businesses are having to close, proposal such as this, where successful major retailingbusinesses are willing to commit to Lurgan, the Council must give very serious consideration to these proposals.”However, an independentreview of the application by Tom Stokes Associated Planning expressed concerns that rather than support the town centre, the application,approved, is “more likely to create an alternative retail destination to the town centre”.The report said that with  per cent of the Lurgan town centre’s turnover allocated to just two stores, the remaining smaller conveniencestores in Lurgan could be “vulnerable to impact” by the approval of this application.The review also suggested that the proposal would be better suited to the former Tesco site in Castle Lane as it is “a key regeneration site in the town centre”.However, in response to this, the application’s agent, Inaltus Ltd, said: “If this site did not suit Tesco’s servicing requirements, there are no grounds for TSA to suggest it will suit Home Bargains.”In conclusion Inaltus Ltd’s response to TSA assessmentstates that whilst some aspects of the TSA Review can be agreed “other aspects are illogical and do not form a sound basis to refuse the proposal on”.It also notes that no objections have been lodged in over  months and called for the application to be brought before Council’s planning committee.The application is now set to appear before Wednesday’smeeting of the planning committee, with officer’s recommending that the application is approved.-------A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
