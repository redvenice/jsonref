Botswana shares a 1,223-mile border with South Africa, where Omicron was first sequenced. Botswana said on Friday the first cases of Omicron came from four foreign nationals who arrived on 7 November on a diplomatic mission.  “We are concerned that there seem to have been attempts to stigmatise the country where it was detected,” Dikoloti added, criticising derogatory reports of a so-called “Botswana variant”. Both cases were recent arrivals from Nigeria and are Canada’s first from the new variant. Canada banned travellers who had visited southern Africa countries in the past two weeks in a ban which came into effect on Friday. “Today, the province of Ontario has confirmed two cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in Ottawa, both of which were reported in iniduals with recent travel from Nigeria. Ottawa Public Health is conducting case and contact management and the patients are in isolation,” the Ontario government said. The health minister, Christine Elliott, and chief medical officer, Kieran Moore, said in a statement: “The best defence against the Omicron variant is stopping it at our border. In addition to the measures recently announced, we continue to urge the federal government to take the necessary steps to mandate point-of-arrival testing for all travellers irrespective of where they’re coming from to further protect against the spread of this new variant.”Israel shut its borders to all travellers on Sunday at 10pm GMT, in moves which are more severe but less discriminatory than other flight bans imposed by other countries.From Monday to Wednesday the World Health Assembly – WHO’s decision-making body of 194 member states – meets in Geneva, Switzerland. The negotiations will discuss how to establish an intergovernmental body to boost international co-operation in preparing, preventing and responding to the next pandemic. The goal is to reduce the devastating economic consequences and catastrophic loss of life witnessed during the Covid pandemic. A stumbling block to agreement had been the US’s refusal of language that would have been any such treaty legally binding, but the US has partly relented for now, helping produce an agreement. “WHO member states today informally agreed to start negotiations on a pandemic treaty. Now the resolution needs to be formally adopted tomorrow by world leaders,” said the European Union’s diplomatic mission in Geneva. It added: “The events of the last weeks demonstrate more than ever the need for global solidarity and leadership. We look forward to world leaders demonstrating their joint commitment tomorrow. The momentum is there – the planet must be better prepared.” Ramaphosa said he will not be imposing further restrictions at this time, saying this phase of the pandemic differs due to the availability of vaccines. Just under one-quarter of people in South Africa are double-vaccinated. Ramaphosa opposes travel bans announced on southern African countries in recent days, amid fears of the economic toll. The World Health Organization echoed Ramaphosa’s concern on Sunday and called for borders to remain open, citing uncertainty over the transmissibility, severity and vaccine disruption from Omicron.The government’s vaccines watchdog, which held an emergency meeting over the weekend, could advise the use of boosters for younger people, as well as a cut in the current six-month wait between second and booster doses,  understands. Secondary school pupils will also be told to wear masks in communal areas, and from Tuesday measures will come into effect mandating face coverings in shops and on public transport, as ministers step up suppression tactics. My colleagues Peter Walker and Linda Geddes have the full story here.  “Using passenger locator data, the Public Health Agency is identifying and contacting iniduals who have recently arrived in Northern Ireland from red list countries,” Stormont health minister Robin Swann said on Sunday.  He added: “They and their household members will be asked to self-isolate and undertake PCR tests. If any positive cases are detected, the sample will then undergo whole genome sequencing to determine the variant type.” No Omicron cases are confirmed in Northern Ireland but England has recorded three infections so far. Swann urged the public to follow the steps to beat back infections, such as: The strain was identified as a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization on 26 November – due to mutations to the virus’s spike protein that appear to boost its transmissibility – which is a more serious designation than “variant of interest”. Researchers at Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome, Italy, on Sunday released a three-dimensional image of the variant. The researchers said in a statement: It comes after the landlocked east African country reimposed a 24-hour quarantine on Friday, coming into effect Sunday, for all arriving travellers. Prime minister Édouard Ngirente’s office also said it would now be compulsory to be fully vaccinated and tested at events such as conferences and concerts. But the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, urged countries on Sunday to avoid travel bans, as the transmissibility and severity of the new variant are still being investigated and such a policy “attacks global solidarity”. (See my earlier post for more details.) Zeman sat in a wheelchair and wore a face covering while appointing Petr Fiala, of the centre-right Civic Democratic party, as prime minister at the Lány Chateau near Prague. He was accompanied by a medic in full protective gear. Leaders such as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, former US president Donald Trump, Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, and UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who became critically ill with the disease, have all tested positive for the virus. Fiala ousted incumbent Andrej Babiš, whose offshore financial arrangements were spotlighted by ’s Pandora Papers investigation published last month. The new Czech government’s agenda includes suppressing a new wave of Covid infections threatening to overwhelm hospitals, with Czech positive tests surging to 27,793 on Friday from 5,842 four weeks before on 29 October. The Czech government declared a 30-day state of emergency on Friday, introducing new restrictions such as banning Christmas markets and imposing a 10pm curfew on restaraunts, bars and nightclubs.

Photograph: Michael Mac SweeneyProvisionChristmas trees aren’t just for Christmas, at least for the Cork business with a pot-grown tree initiative that sees householders rent their tree in early December and bring it back to the farm in early January, to be cared for all year around.Colm Crowley from Glanmire says his 5ft trees, which are rented out for €40 a year, are a very sustainable way to celebrate Christmas.Customers can rent or buy a living Christmas tree in a pot from Cork Pot Grown Christmas Trees. The rented ones are then taken back to the farm in Rosscarbery, west Cork, after the festive season.“I started off with small pot-grown trees and I started selling them for €10 or €15 and a lot of customers were coming in asking, ‘have you anything bigger?’ It got me thinking that there was a market for bigger pot-grown Christmas trees.‘Always alive’“With the pot-grown trees, they are never dead. They are always alive. They continue to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and provide oxygen as well,” he says.“They come with a care leaflet. The water would be the big one: making sure they have enough water but not too much because too much would cause root rot,” he says.“I found that pot-grown trees are very big in America and it has started spreading to Germany and the UK. I knew that Irish people would love it.”It takes 12-14 years to grow a Christmas tree from seed, with a lot of work involved in pruning, shaping and making the tree perfect.“It is only used for four weeks. With the pot growns, we get to use the tree over and over. That said, cut Christmas trees are also very environmentally friendly because when a tree is cut in November, another one or two are planted in spring. With the pot growns, between November and spring that cycle continues, so for those few months the Christmas trees continue to take the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and provide oxygen.”As rental trees will continue to grow throughout the year, Crowley is anticipating customers not recognising their tree when it is returned to them the following Christmas.‘Exact same tree’“They send me pictures looking for the exact same tree,” he says.“With the rentals, you are getting the same Christmas tree you liked and picked out. But it will have continued to grow. There is a lovely smell – you are bringing a bit of forest in your house.”Crowley says the real Christmas tree business has grown hugely since he first started selling, from his mother Margaret’s house in Ballinlough, Cork city, in 1998 before moving to bigger premises.Last year was particularly buoyant for sales as families sought to create a festive atmosphere during the pandemic.“Sales right across the country were probably up around 50 per cent. People wanted a bit of happiness. They needed cheering up.”Customers are encouraged to name their trees, with the two most popular names being “Spruce Springsteen” and “Woody”.The father of two adds that he couldn’t survive the December whirlwind without the hard work of wife Jacqui and mother-in-law Rose."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dfa advises irish citizens in south africa to fly home via commercial means","story":"Prof Tulio de Oliveira, who announced the news of the Omicron variant last week, is urging the international community not to ‘discriminate or isolate’ South Africa. Photograph: Joao Silva The New York TimesThe Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has urged Irish citizens caught up in the seven southern African countries affected by the latest Covid-19 travel restrictions to continue trying to find a way back to Ireland via “commercial means” and to maintain contact with their airline or travel agent. A DFA spokeswoman said on Sunday the Government was aware of the “limited availability and continued disruption to flights from the region” and Irish officials were liaising with people in South Africa and other affected countries through the Irish Embassy in Pretoria. The spokeswoman did not say whether the Government was planning a repatriation flight for Irish citizens in South Africa as it did last year for people caught in Peru, Nigeria and India when the pandemic first hit.“The situation is evolving quickly and additional measures affecting flights may be introduced at short notice,” she said. Paul Donnelly from Dublin was due to travel home from Cape Town on Friday night after spending a week in South Africa for work. He received a text from Air France while he was en route to the airport saying his flight to Paris had been cancelled. He then discovered the next available flight to Paris was one week away. He eventually found a flight via Amsterdam and booked “pretty much the last seat out of Cape Town on KLM”. Despite the international chaos unfolding around borders closing and flight cancellations, the atmosphere in the airport in Cape Town on Saturday was calm and orderly, he said. Mr Donnelly, who arrived home on Sunday afternoon, will now quarantine in his family home for the next 10 days. Having watched South African news reports over the weekend, he said there was a sense of frustration that the country was being blamed for this latest variant. “South Africans would probably see themselves as at the forefront of medical scientific research and for their genomic surveillance. They kind of felt like they were being punished for catching this and giving full disclosure.” The UK’s decision to immediately close its borders to South African travel was also a real slap in the face, he added. “The UK is their largest inbound tourist partner for people trying to get some winter sun. If it all shuts down, the economy will have a horrific time.”DiscriminationProf Tulio de Oliveira, who announced the news of the Omicron variant last week, took to Twitter urging the international community not to “discriminate or isolate” South Africa for being the country which sounded the alarm. “We have been very transparent with scientific information, he tweeted. “We identified, made data public, and raised the alarm as the infections are just increasing. We did this to protect our country and the world in spite of potentially suffering massive discrimination.” The world’s billionaires must now join together to ensure the poorest and most vulnerable can access the vaccine in order to combat Covid and “extinguish the variants”, he added in a Twitter thread.

The Munster rugby team confirmed on Sunday that a member of their squad had tested positive for Covid-19 in South Africa. The province were preparing to depart Cape Town for Dublin on a chartered flight on Sunday, along with the other United Rugby Championship (URC) sides leaving South Africa.However, they will now not travel, after a round of PCR testing returned one positive result.“In taking all precautions and prioritising the health and wellbeing of everyone, Munster Rugby will not travel today and will return to their hotel for an isolation period as a matter of priority,” said a Munster statement. “The province will await further guidance from the health authorities.”A URC spokesman said the situation on Sunday evening around travel for the team remained “fluid”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron symptoms mild so far says south african doctor who discovered it","story":" A flight information board shows canceled flights at Johannesburg’s OR Thambo International Airport as restrictions on international flights from South Africa start to take effect. Photograph: EPA The doctor who discovered the new Omicron Covid-19 variant has said the UK is panicking unnecessarily, while South Africa’s health minister said travel restrictions imposed on his country are “uncalled for”.Joe Phaahla claimed international travel restrictions will not prevent the spread of the new variant and instead suggested regular testing and mask wearing, including when flying, are effective measures to help live with the virus.Meanwhile, the doctor who discovered the Omicron variant said the UK is “panicking unnecessarily” when asked on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show.Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told the programme she first encountered the variant in a man in his early 30s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache, but none of the usual coronavirus symptoms.She said: “What we are seeing clinically in South Africa, and remember I’m at the epicentre - that’s where I’m practising - it’s extremely mild.”When asked if the UK was “panicking unnecessarily”, she said: “I think you already have it there in your country and you’re not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say, definitely.“Two weeks from now maybe we will say something different.”South Africa was the first country to detect the new Omicron variant of Covid-19.Two cases have since been confirmed in the UK but South Africa and some other African nations have been added to UK red lists for international travel.Cases have also been found in a number of other countries. Speaking on LBC radio, South Africa’s health minister Dr Phaahla said wealthier countries like the UK “definitely” need to give more vaccine doses to countries in Africa.Dr Phaahla said he has heard from medical professionals in his country that young unvaccinated people have been admitted to hospital with the variant form of Covid-19.He said he has heard anecdotally that cases of the new variant have been “mild” and mostly in the young, for whom vaccination rates are relatively low in South Africa.Dr Phaahla also said the UK’s new travel restrictions are “very unfortunate and uncalled for”.He said “we’ve been here before”, adding: “We’ve seen in practice that it doesn’t work.“The US did that in the beginning of Covid-19 ... and many other countries followed ... but in the end throughout the various waves of Covid-19 we’ve come to terms with the fact that even by the time we were informed by the scientists of this variant, it was gone, it was already everywhere.”He said “we’ve learned over these last 20 months how to live with the virus” and outlined a number of measures such as masks and regular testing, including for flights, which he said are recognised worldwide and “are working”.He added: “Otherwise you just a create false sense of safety amongst your people when it is not safe.”British prime minister Boris Johnson held a call with South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday.Asked if young unvaccinated people are being admitted to hospital with the new variant in South Africa, Dr Phaahla said: “Yes. Younger, unvaccinated people ... 65 per cent of those they’ve admitted, who are mainly younger people, are actually those who are unvaccinated.”He said he has heard from GPs that the “majority of the people they’ve been seeing are mild”, but stressed it is “not proper research”.Asked what he knows about how unwell people are who have the new strain, Dr Phaahla said: “It is still too early at this stage.“Some of what I’ve read from some of our clinicians has been that thus far they have not witnessed severe illness. Part of it may be because the majority of those who are positive are young people.”He added at this stage they do not know what proportion of the younger people who have Omicron are ending up in hospital. - PA Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron variant the knowns and unknowns","story":"A high number of mutations does not mean Omnicron  poses a greater threat, though it may make it more likely to look different to the immune systemAlmost two years into a pandemic horrible uncertainties remain, yet “the knowns” about how Covid-19 behaves are considerable. Responsiveness to emerging variants is much improved.The Omicron variant arising in countries of southern Africa has rung alarm bells much more promptly, while better international collaboration between scientists and health authorities means a global response is being scaled up rapidly – even if travel bans are of limited benefit.This is familiar territory, given the way Alpha and Delta variants behaved, but precautionary measures kicked in a lot quicker. Compared with early Covid waves, the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of masks, social distancing, reducing contacts and ventilation has strengthened. These are sensible precautions even if they will not stop Omnicron spread. They will slow it, generating time to learn more about the variant while increasing booster uptake. This is prudent as the Northern Hemisphere faces into winter when flu and other respiratory viruses are prevalent. Clearly, another surge of Covid cases risks tipping health services over the edge.Omicron is likely to be distributed widely across the planet – including Ireland – already and so a counter strategy with that in mind is wise.What we know about the Omicron variant?This variant has a large number of mutations: 50 overall 10 on “the receptor binding domain” of the spike protein. This suggests it emerged from a persistent infection in an immunocompromised person. A high number of mutations does not mean the variant poses a greater threat, though it may make it more likely to look different to the immune system. If it fails to recognise it, there may be “immune escape” with people who have recovered from a previous Covid-19 infection, or who have been vaccinated, failing to recognise the virus and becoming ill despite prior immunity. The variant is rapidly increasing in Africa, suggesting it is more infectious than previous strains, or that there is less immunity to it. Even if vaccines work just as well, we would need to have more people vaccinated and immune in order to achieve herd immunity to a more infectious strain.What is unknown about Omicron as of yet?The main concern is we don’t know how transmissible it is, and if vaccines will be less effective especially in curbing severity of disease.Frantic efforts are being made to answer the transmissibility question. So far, current vaccines have worked well against the predominant Delta variant to reduce severe disease and death – though they are less effective in preventing infectionreinfection.If vaccines are shown to be less effective, they can be adjusted within days but new versions will require clinical evaluation and regulatory approval.The other big unknown is if there are particular circumstances associated with where the variant has emerged. Immunisation status in Ireland and much of Europe is more favourable than in Africa, where there has been low vaccine uptake.So far, Europe is only seeing “imported cases”. When there is local spread within a population – not linked to international travel – we will see how much transmissibility there is in a typical European population.Will this new variant change this balance? Data gaps mean that answer is not yet available, so reimposing restrictions is warranted.One stark indication, however, stands out. The world has done a poor job in ensuring poorer countries are vaccinated. In that scenario, conditions are perfect for new more dangerous variants to emerge.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coalition leaders to discuss omicron variant with nphet on monday","story":"Cape Town International Airport. A number of countries have introduced travel bans and restrictions on passengers from southern African countries in a bid to contain the new variant. Photograph: Nic BothmaEPA The Omicron variant and the wider pressures on the health service from the fourth wave of the pandemic will be discussed at a meeting of the leaders of the Coalition parties and the National Public Health Emergency Team on Monday. The Nphet is expected to meet tomorrow and consider the views of its Epidemiological Team which has been monitoring the fast-evolving developments around the Omicron variant, which has recently seen more cases discovered in different countries. After this meeting, it is understood chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan will then brief the three party leaders, ahead of the scheduled Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, where Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan has said the possible reintroduction of mandatory hotel quarantine in response to concerns over Omicron is set to be the first item on the agenda. In a statement, the Nphet said it was “considering further required measures” as countries move to prevent the spread of Omicron. “Regulations are being drawn up urgently to give effect to the new travel and home quarantine policies.” A number of countries have introduced travel bans and restrictions on passengers from southern African countries in a bid to contain the new variant. Cases have been detected in a number of countries, including 13 in the Netherlands and three in the UK. PCR testing In the UK new restrictions, including PCR testing for arrivals into the UK, will apply from Tuesday morning.However, an exemption will apply to passengers in the Common Travel Area (CTA) which covers Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the Channel Islands, and which allows effectively unrestricted travel.The Irish Government is to consider the steps taken by the UK and a senior source said all responses to the variant were now under review.In Ireland, new rules introduced on Friday sees people arriving here from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique required to present a “not-detected” pre-flight PCR result, regardless of vaccination status, and quarantine at home for 10 days, undergoing a further two PCR tests.The Department of Foreign Affairs has changed its travel advisory to “avoid non-essential travel” to these countries.The travel restrictions have prompted a scramble for passengers to get home from these countries with many Irish nationals struggling to secure a flight. The Munster Rugby team, in South Africa for a series of matches that were ultimately cancelled, has been forced to prolong its stay after a member of the party tested positive. Early evidence suggests Omicron has an increased reinfection risk, according to the World Health Organisation, which has designated the variant as being of concern.Earlier on Sunday it was confirmed that a further 3,735 cases of coronavirus had been reported in the State. As of 8am, 566 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, 117 of whom are in ICU.In a statement, Dr Holohan said: “While there is much attention on new variants, incidence of the delta variant of Covid-19 remains too high in Ireland, with widespread infection in the community.” Impact Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan on Sunday said real impact of the Omicron variant would not be known for a number of weeks.“It will take two to three weeks to see, well, does it increase transmissibility, does it increase illness or can it get around vaccines,” he told RTÉ’s The Week in Politics programme. Mr Ryan said Ireland is doing “a lot of testing”, but that the Omicron variant had not yet been picked up.Dr Cillian de Gascun, head of the National Virus Reference Laboratory and Nphet member, said the State needs to operate on the basis that the Omicron variant could “change the game”. Dr de Gascun on Sunday said the mutations this variant has are “concerning”.However, while he said that the variant appears to be more transmissible, it does not necessarily mean vaccines will be ineffective against it.He said there has not been an examination of the severity of the virus yet, as there is typically a lag between infection and hospitalisation.Dr de Gascun said the variant is a “concern” among Irish health officials who are meeting over the weekend to discuss it.“We are still in the middle of a very significant Delta wave that we need to control first. We don’t know yet what Omicron does in a Delta wave,” he told Newstalk’s On the Record.He added that there was a need for society to think about the next three months, and not just Christmas.Separately, in comments to the Sunday Business Post newspaper, Dr de Gascun said that if Omicron is more transmissible than the Delta variant, then it is a “matter of time” before the new variant arrives in Ireland.Dr de Gascun told the Sunday Business Post there would be a ramping up of genome sequencing, and every positive Covid-19 sample since November 1st would be screened for Omicron.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet meeting to monitor omicron variant and considering further measures","story":"British prime minister Boris Johnson has announced fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the country.

Photograph: Kim LudbrookThe Nphet Epidemiological Team is meeting regularly this weekend to monitor the developing Omicron variant situation in Europe and is “considering further required measures”, the Department of Health said in a statement this evening.On Saturday night, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) said it was aware of new cases of Omicron in the UK, Italy, Germany and Belgium even though it has not been formally notified by European Alert Systems as yet.“The Nphet Epidemiological Team are meeting regularly over the weekend to monitor the situation and are currently considering further required measures,” it said.It added that a series of initial measures have been put in place to mitigate against the arrival of this variant to Ireland.“The situation regarding this new variant will be kept under continuous review by all relevant bodies.”Measures currently in place include the emergency brake for travel to and from the seven countries of concern in respect of the variant.The Department of Foreign Affairs has changed its travel advisory to “avoid non-essential travel” to these countries. Irish residents returning home from these countries will be required to undergo strict home quarantine regardless of vaccine status or recovery status. They will also need to undergo PCR testing during quarantine.“Regulations are being drawn up urgently to give effect to the new travel and home quarantine policies,” said the Nphet statement.“The Department of Justice is arranging increased BMU spot-checking of passengers on arrival.”Nphet also confirmed that mandatory hotel quarantine options are being examined on a contingency basis.UK requirementsThe Irish Government is to review the steps taken by the UK government against the new Covid-19 Omicron variant, which requires all travellers entering the state take a PCR test by the second day of arrival.A Government source said that all responses to the variant were under review including the UK’s response announced by prime minister Boris Johnson on Saturday.A series of meetings will be held in the coming days to address the public health challenges posed to Ireland by the Omicron variant, first discovered in South Africa.The source said that advice was not to follow the UK lead for the moment but to await the outcome of a series of high-level discussions over the next few days on the best approach. That might include a decision to follow the UK’s lead requiring all incoming passengers to take a PCR test upon arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. However, that possibility has yet to be discussed by senior ministers and public health advisers.It is also understood that work is also being done this weekend on a new passenger locator form for people arriving into Irish territory. This will ensure that the original place of travel is included in the form. None of the seven countries in Southern Africa which originally notified cases of the new variant have direct flights into Ireland.It comes following the announcement that legislation is being prepared to reintroduce mandatory hotel quarantine. Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said on Saturday it would be the first item on the agenda at the Cabinet meeting next Tuesday.‘Emergency brake’On Friday, the Irish Government followed the European Union in agreeing to implement an “emergency brake” on arrivals from seven southern African countries.Mr Ryan also said the Department of Foreign Affairs was working with a “small number” of people in southern Africa who were trying to get back to Ireland following the travel restrictions.Mr Ryan said there were limited options available for people with the airlines and the department was looking at chartering a plane to repatriate these people.Mr Ryan said news of the Omicron variant was a shock and one of the most disheartening recent developments in the pandemic.“I’ll be honest, I was frightened yesterday. It was a blow. I was thinking if we get these boosters out in the next few weeks we’ll be in better shape, and we will.”He said it was not clear yet if this new variant was more transmissible or was able to bypass some of the protections offered by vaccines.Asked if the Cabinet would consider other restrictions in addition to mandatory quarantine, Mr Ryan said the truth was that a lot of what has been done will have to be continued.Under the restrictions announced on Friday, people arriving into Ireland from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique will have to present “not-detected” pre-flight PCR result, regardless of vaccination status, and quarantine at home for 10 days, undergoing a further two PCR tests.Sinn Féin’s health spokesman David Cullinane said it was accepted the Omicron variant was a real concern and there was a need to move fast.A spokesperson for the department said it was providing consular assistance to Irish citizens who had requested it.

Photograph: Hollie AdamsGetty A woman who arrived back into Ireland from South Africa earlier this week and has now developed symptoms of Covid-19 says she has not yet been able to get a PCR test.The woman, who asked not to be named, arrived back last Monday, November 22nd, having transited through Heathrow. She woke up on Friday morning with a scratchy throat, and took an antigen test as provided by her company. It was negative. Since then her symptoms have persisted and she now has a tickly throat, dry cough and a headache and is “pretty ill”.She has done two antigen tests both of which were negative, but the health authorities have advised that symptomatic people get a PCR Covid-19 test.She tried booking a PCR test near her home in Co Laois on Friday but found the closest Health Service Executive centre, in Portarlington, was booked out as were other centres in the midlands. She then booked a private test in Dublin but has since cancelled that test after receiving a text message from the HSE on Sunday asking that she self-isolate and not leave her home as she had “travelled from a country at high risk of Covid-19”. HSE textIn the text, the HSE directed the woman to self-isolate for 10 days from her date of arrival in Ireland and to “attend a PCR test asap” and on day eight after arrival in Ireland.“You will receive a text message with the date and time of your PCR test(s),” said the text. “Your household contacts also need to self-isolate (stay in their room) for that same 10 day period,” it added.She also received a text from Britain’s National Health Service on Sunday informing her she was a close contact of another passenger on her flight from Heathrow last Monday. The woman is now awaiting details from the HSE on her PCR test date but has no car to get to a testing centre. She says the only way to reach a centre will be by public transport. Airport laxness She also watched one of her best friend’s weddings on WhatsApp as “I don’t want to be THAT person who has brought Omicron to our little island.”She filled in the passenger locator form demanded of all visitors to Ireland when she arrived last Monday, but said there was nobody checking it when she arrived back into Dublin Airport, albeit three days before news of the new variant broke.By contrast her brother who lives in the UK arrived back from South Africa on Sunday. The NHS contacted him on Thursday and he had a PCR test straight away, she said. Later that day, he also received a PCR test in the post. “Why is that not an option in Ireland?” she asked. “I would pay for a private PCR test to be delivered to me, but I can’t understand why the HSE is not posting out PCR tests.

Photograph: Abir SultanEPANew cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant continued to be detected around the world on Sunday, as nations tried to delay a surge in infections by restricting travel and imposing new quarantine measures.Omicron first emerged earlier this month in southern Africa. The World Health Organisation (WHO) designated it a “variant of concern” on Friday, saying it appeared to be able to reinfect patients and that it displayed mutations previously associated with diminished vaccine efficacy and higher transmissibility.Both findings are yet to be confirmed, and it is also not yet known whether the variant alters the severity of Covid-19.The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, South Korea and others have all severely limited travel to and from the southern African region. Switzerland has also restricted travel to non-African nations where cases have been detected.Israel became the first country to close its borders to foreigners, with officials previously signalling they were on the verge of declaring a state of emergency. At least one case has been confirmed and several more are suspected. Returning travellers will be forced to quarantine, and the government has deployed the army and domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet to track them down.‘Tired of life’“Everyone is tired of life in the shadow of the coronavirus,” said prime minister Naftali Bennett. “I hear what people are saying to me: ‘We have just emerged from the Delta strain and now a new strain has arrived?’ It is not easy but it is reality.”European countries were racing to contain the Omicron variant amid a resurgence of cases caused by the earlier Delta variant. Dutch health minister Hugo de Jonge on Sunday said 13 Omicron cases were found among 61 passengers who tested positive for the virus on two flights from South Africa to Amsterdam on Friday. All positive passengers have been forced into hotel quarantine for seven days and Mr de Jonge said it was “conceivable” that more Omicron cases were present in the country.The Netherlands has imposed one of the EU’s most stringent lockdown restrictions over the past two weeks, with non-essential shops shutting at 5pm and quarantine imposed on returnees from high-risk areas.Calls for renewed lockdowns are growing louder in Germany after the national academy of sciences, Leopoldina, published a paper advising the government to introduce restrictions on public and private gatherings, including for the vaccinated. Two cases of the Omicron variant have been confirmed in the southern state of Bavaria.In an interview with Bild am Sonntag, German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier called on citizens to prevent a lockdown by voluntarily restricting their contact with others.Three-day quarantineSaudi Arabia said via the state news agency SPA it would allow direct entry from all countries on condition that the passenger had received one vaccine dose in Saudi Arabia, and mandated a three-day quarantine for travellers.US chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said the variant could already be present in the country. No cases had yet been detected.The WHO has called for “balance” in the global response to the variant, saying countries should strategically deploy their testing and sequencing capabilities to counter it. The Omicron variant can be detected by proxy on routine PCR tests, as it misses a gene – S – that Alpha, a previous variant, also lacks. Genomic sequencing is needed to confirm its presence.Since coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, more than 261 million people have been infected globally, and at least 5.1 million have died, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britain needs new non woke universities","story":"Several universities in the UK now have what amount to mandatory ‘wokeness’ tests, in which new students must give the ‘correct’ answers to questions on progressive topics such as equality, ersity and sustainability.The University of Kent puts its first-years through a ‘white privilege’ quiz, while at St Andrews, students must take a bias admitting their ‘personal guilt’ before they can begin their studies. Wolfson College, Cambridge freshers have been told to attend anti-racism seminars covering everything from “microaggressions” to how “whiteness is centric” in society.At these and many other universities, students attempting to hold debates on supposedly contentious topics such as feminism, abortion or Israel, may find their speakers intimidated away. On some courses it is so widely believed that expressing non-woke opinions would mean poor grades (if not dismissal) that it seems likely that students who don’t agree either suppress their true opinions (presumably under-performing as a result) or else steer clear of these subjects altogether.Admittedly this progressive and censorious shift may well reflect the opinions of today’s young people. In a recent YouGov poll of those who took a view either way, 70 per cent of 18-24 year olds thought being woke was more a good thing than a bad thing. But for the rest, there should be provision made so that they can pursue the subjects they are good at, enjoying freedom of conscience and expression.Some have proposed new rules enshrining universities’ obligation to protect free expression on campus. But another path would be competition. The government could broker and fund the creation of new ‘non-woke’, or more tolerant progressive institutions, while still allowing the current core to conduct themselves as they think best. In the US, the University of Austin has been established for just this purpose.Non-woke, or tolerant woke students who wished to engage with differing views, could then decide whether they valued the ability to study in an environment of freedom of conscience. Maybe they actually don’t care. Or perhaps a progressive university environment creates a disciplined setting, with well-established ground-rules that facilitate study, just as a school with rules that may seem excessively strict to outsiders might actually work better than a more liberal institution. The competitive process and outcomes (such as the university experience, exam results and how students turn out afterwards) will tell. Different methods could be assessed on a range of metrics.Woke people often find proposals of this kind incomprehensible. They don’t regard their beliefs as matters of political opinion or debatable in any way, viewing them as merely facts or the unquestionable moral consensus. As they see it, principles such as the idea that treating people of all races the same is the best route to a harmonious society, or that only women can have a cervix, are simply factually wrong. To have a university for people who believed such things would be like having a university for people who think the Earth is flat.Perhaps most university study is indeed best conducted in an environment of disciplined purity, with students and lecturers protected from encountering opinions and behaviours they might find offensive or otherwise distracting. But for a minority, the freedom to hold and express opinions that the majority of the adult population consider commonplace will be key to a flourishing university life, not to mention success in the real world.The government should support universities that wish to do that, without feeling it needs to crush out the core woke approach in the process. Let a thousand flowers bloom, and time and competition will tell us which type of university soil is most fecund.More from NewsWhy the omicron Covid variant is the most concerning so farPrince of Wales to reaffirm ‘affection’ for Barbados at republic ceremonyUK and Israel join forces to stop Iran gaining nuclear weaponsWobbling Tories should stick with the PM’s bold interventionist visionOmicron will cause chaos in schools, warn MPsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hipster cafes no match great british greasy spoon","story":"Hungry? Hungover? Overtaken by a craving for bacon, egg, baked beans, sausage and a fried slice? There was a time when the remedy was readily to be found at the local greasy spoon. Steamy windows, formica-topped tables, a cosy fug of frying bacon, strong tea and damp work clothes – so cherished a British institution were these humble establishments that in 2013 the American magazine Food \u0026amp Wine published a round-up of “London’s Best Greasy Spoons”.It was unfamiliar territory for readers of the publication that introduced American foodies to “Perrier, the purple Peruvian potato and Patagonian toothfish”, and the article began with a baffled attempt to define the strange charm of the greasy spoon: “Roughly analogous to an American diner – but without the free refills … most customers just call them caffs – i.e. café without pronouncing the ‘e’.” The unwary transatlantic visitor “might see dishes that you thought had died out in the 1950s, such as boiled bacon or liver and onions. You will not get salad…” The Brits, it added, were strangers to crispy bacon: “Many British people like a soggy rasher.”Thus forewarned, it seems unlikely that any but the most intrepid American tourist would have braved a soggy rasher, let alone the black pudding, dripping toast and mug of Camp Coffee that were the specialities of George’s, the caff that sustained my student years.Now, however, even those who fancy an alternative to an Egg McMuffin may struggle to find it, for the greasy spoon has become an endangered species.The hammer-blow of lockdown, combined with rising rents, the inexorable advance of chain coffee shops and a health-conscious aversion to the old-fashioned fry-up, has seen a lengthening list of greasy spoons close their doors, or reinvent themselves as hipster hangouts.Given the cyclical nature of fashion, the greasy spoon will probably rise again, albeit with organic sausages, craft beers and prices to match. But something irreplaceable will have been lost with the passing of those cheap, nourishing and infinitely democratic establishments: the original caffs without an “e”.In one of my favourite television shows, Friday Night Lights, the long-suffering wife of a high-school football coach in Texas is to be seen knocking back ever-vaster goblets of wine. Her cornucopias of chardonnay brought to mind Auberon Waugh’s recollection of his mother, Laura, a devout Catholic, who allowed herself a single daily glass of sherry during Lent, sipped from “a receptacle which others might have identified as an exceptionally large flower vase”.But for wine o’clock, as for fry-ups, the future looks uncertain. In 2017, the British Medical Journal reported that the size of wine glasses had increased sevenfold over the past three centuries, from 66ml in 1700 to 449ml in 2017. Now a belated hangover has set in: sales of small wine glasses (250ml or less) at John Lewis have risen by 13 per cent over the past year.For years, as I dutifully follow Rowley Leigh’s infallible timetable for cooking Christmas lunch without tears, I have obeyed his injunction to “treat yourself to another drink”. As we approach what the BMJ cheerily described as “the culturally legitimised deviancy of festive drinking”, I look forward with dismay to wrangling the turkey in a state of irreproachable sobriety.More from NewsWhy the omicron Covid variant is the most concerning so farPrince of Wales to reaffirm ‘affection’ for Barbados at republic ceremonyUK and Israel join forces to stop Iran gaining nuclear weaponsWobbling Tories should stick with the PM’s bold interventionist visionOmicron will cause chaos in schools, warn MPsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"price covid testing kits set soar wake new omicron rules","story":"PCR test prices are set to soar in the wake of the new omicron rules amid warnings that private companies will “hike their prices”.Some providers have already started to raise their prices in the past 24 hours, according to Paul Charles, chief executive of The PC Agency, a travel consultancy.Speaking at the Downing Street press conference on Saturday, the Prime Minister insisted that “we are not going to stop people travelling”. But he said that all passengers arriving from abroad will now have to take a PCR test by the end of their second day after reaching the country and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.Mr Charles, a former Virgin Atlantic executive, told The : “You can guarantee test providers will be hiking their prices at any sign of increased demand.“The test providers are in the private sector and they are basing their prices on demand. If demand goes up they will put their prices up.“There is no regulation and no major oversight of private test providers. The testing industry is worth well over a billion pounds and has grown up at very short notice.”Other countries - including Portugal and Switzerland - have also heightened their entry restrictions.From December 1, all arrivals in Portugal must show evidence of a negative Covid-19 test, regardless of vaccination status. For entry to Switzerland, Britons must show a negative PCR test and quarantine for 10 days. Spain will only be accepting fully vaccinated British tourists from next month.“I think the new self-isolation measures will wipe out most inbound business and leisure trips in what is a very critical period running up to Christmas because why would you bother if you need to isolate?” Mr Charles said.“They will also reduce the number of new overseas trips from the UK during the late December period, which is also a critical period for many travel firms.”He said the Government has created the kind of uncertainty around travel that “decimated” bookings earlier in the pandemic.“When you introduce quarantine - whether in a hotel or at home - it reduces confidence and puts people off booking. These measures will be quite damaging at a time when the industry is just recovering.”Mr Charles said the fear in the travel industry is that the red list will widen as more cases are found, “before knowledge is really out there about the impact of the vaccine” on the omicron variant.South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola have all been added to the red list, with flights from these countries to the UK banned.This means that anyone arriving from these countries will have to spend 10 days in a hotel quarantine on their return to the UK, and will face a £10,000 penalty if they flout the rules.Those who arrived back from these countries before 4am on Sunday via another country, or who have arrived back from South Africa in the last 10 days, will need to quarantine at home for 10 days.Meanwhile, Labour has called for pre-departure tests for travellers in the wake of the latest omicron variant.Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said her party “desperately” wanted to see the Government “tighten up” travel restrictions after two new cases of the variant were discovered in England. Over the weekend Boris Johnson announced new precautionary measures to try take control of the variant, including stipulating that all international arrivals must take a day two PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. However, Ms Nandy said the Government needed to introduce more than a day two test.She said: “The Government is saying everyone has to have a PCR test on day two when they arrive back in the UK, but they’re not suggesting pre-departure tests for people before they board flights.”She told Trevor Phillips On Sunday that despite the Government having been “warned” for months, there was currently no advice for people about travelling back from the airport on public transport and that there were “very few checks on the PCR tests that are done”. Ms Nandy added that questions remained for the Government around the scientific advice provided on mask wearing and the “very little action on ventilation in public buildings”. Meanwhile Labour MP Yvette Cooper said the Government should reinstate pre-travel tests “immediately” to help identify and contain the spread of the Omicron variant.She said: “Only reintroducing PCR tests after two days home isn\u0027t sufficient as a precautionary approach as it leaves far too many gaps in the system.“People can still travel on busy planes, wait in busy departure or arrival halls, then travel home on buses, trains or the tube, all without being tested at all.”Ms Cooper said that it was known from previous waves and variants that “the virus spreads via other countries and via indirect flights, not just directly from the countries most affected - which is why early testing from all countries is vital”.“But, once again, the Government seems to be leaving major gaps in the travel testing regime,” Ms Cooper added. “They have done this too many times before and they mustn\u0027t make the same mistakes again. They need to learn from what happened with previous waves and get comprehensive testing in place fast.“Until we know more about omicron and its interaction with our vaccines, the Government needs to take swift and sensible measures to stop it spreading into the UK.”More from NewsWhy the omicron Covid variant is the most concerning so farPrince of Wales to reaffirm ‘affection’ for Barbados at republic ceremonyUK and Israel join forces to stop Iran gaining nuclear weaponsWobbling Tories should stick with the PM’s bold interventionist visionOmicron will cause chaos in schools, warn MPsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wobbling tories should stick pms bold interventionist vision","story":"The Tories are in a funk. MPs mutter about the Prime Minister. Cabinet ministers jockey for position. Pundits question the purpose and identity of the Government.Some complain ministers are spending too much. Some worry that without tax cuts and deregulation we are getting “the wrong Brexit”. Some believe that the Tory electoral coalition – comprising the so-called Blue and Red Walls – is simply impossible to serve and doomed to rupture. But is it really so?It is true, of course, that public spending rocketed during the cycle of lockdowns. But the furlough scheme and the interventions to keep firms alive while the economy was shuttered were extraordinary measures during a severe crisis. They successfully reduced the economic scarring and social costs of unemployment. But they tell us little about policy beyond Covid.One reason for higher spending – oddly overlooked by many tax campaigners – is that we are a rapidly ageing country. At the turn of the century, one in six of us was older than 65. Today, it is one in five of us, and within 20 years it will be one in four. By then, less than 60 per cent of the population will be of working age. So unless ministers want to slash spending on pensions, health and social care, the amount we spend overall – and the taxes we pay – will unavoidably increase.But another reason for higher spending is a conscious choice. For many of the supply-side reforms the economy needs do not require tax cuts and deregulation, but investment: in infrastructure and in the education and skills our country needs. Yes, we need to reform the property market and get more houses built, and yes, after Brexit we can do more to promote innovation in high-growth sectors such as tech and life sciences. But ministers have judged – rightly – that economic reform requires up-front investment.Those who dislike this direction of travel rarely explain what they would do to meet the growing costs of our ageing society, or how they would train and retrain the country’s workforce. Instead, they are taking their frustrations out on the Government’s two big missions: Brexit, and the aim to “level-up” the country. In both respects they are mistaken.Brexit was never going to be a neo-Thatcherite mission to shrink the state and turn Britain into a European Singapore. Most voters who backed Leave wanted national sovereignty, democratic control and stronger solidarity between citizens. Brexit was popular in places where workers had been squeezed by the bifurcating labour market, caused in part by globalisation. It was followed by a pandemic that highlighted the dangers of stretched global supply chains, a lack of domestic manufacturing capacity and exposure to the Chinese state. These all make the dream of libertarian Leavers even more fanciful.Neither is levelling-up some kind of luxury policy the country can afford to live without. If we want Britain to be a safe and prosperous place to live, we will need to fulfil the economic potential of all its cities, towns and regions. It is a simple question of fairness that opportunity and a good standard of living exist across the country. As the PM argued in his party conference speech, improving the economic performance of under-performing regions helps to take the pressure off London and the South East, where the housing market and transport infrastructure are under huge strain thanks to overpopulation.It is true that there will sometimes be tensions between the interests of the old Blue Wall of more prosperous constituencies and the newly won Red Wall seats. The profile of public spending is changing, ending the old bias in favour of the South East and doing more to help the regions. On the other hand, the social-care policy adopted by the Government benefits wealthier homeowners at the expense of working-age taxpayers and those with more modestly valued assets.But electoral coalitions always require politicians to make calls on who should be the winners and losers of policy. And eventually the coalition of Tory support will collapse, for that is the nature of changing events and democratic politics. But little suggests such a collapse is imminent.Labour is struggling to form its own winning coalition, and we should recall the original definition of Red Wall seats: they were places where demographics suggested that people could have voted Conservative but did not, usually voting Labour instead, thanks to locally specific cultures and habits. Tory voters are, on average, more provincial and less prosperous than they once were, but there is plenty – on economic and cultural issues – that can keep the new and old supporters together.With defensive by-elections approaching (a no-win situation for the talented new party chairman, Oliver Dowden), a mini-slump in the polls, and worries about political space for a challenge opening up from the Right, the Tories are not yet panicking, although the worrying and grumbling is undoubtedly growing louder.The solution to the funk is not to fantasise about unrealistic fiscal policies, nor to flirt with Covid libertarianism. If political space does open on the Right, it will be caused not by economic policies but by a failure to control immigration, cut crime and stand up to Left-wing culture warriors in public institutions and direct-action protests.And at a time when the Government’s competence is under attack, its handling of Covid – the vaccine programme, the avoidance of the surge in cases we see in Europe, and now a sensible response to the omicron variant – should be defended with confidence by Conservative MPs.The Tories need to go the whole hog with their strategy to become more interventionist in the economy, and more robust on culture. They must be competent enough to deliver the things they promise to do, such as sorting out the Channel crossings. And they should tell their story in a way that makes better sense, which means stopping Cabinet ministers running their own discordant and insubordinate campaigns.This wobble need not be the end of the world for the Tories, but they need quickly to get a grip, not lose their nerve.More from NewsWhy the omicron Covid variant is the most concerning so farPrince of Wales to reaffirm ‘affection’ for Barbados at republic ceremonyUK and Israel join forces to stop Iran gaining nuclear weaponsOmicron will cause chaos in schools, warn MPsBoris Johnson should use his levelling up agenda to tackle soaring housing costs, says Theresa MayMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chemists could hold key slashing","story":"Exclusive: Chemists could hold key to slashing NHS waiting lists, says pharmacists leaderThe boss of the National Pharmacy Association urged patients to turn to their local outlets for some health servicesThe National Pharmacy Association urged people to use their community chemists Image: Getty ImagesByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Nov | commentsLocal chemists could hold the key to slashing NHS waiting lists, patients are told tonight.

Boris Johnson reintroduced mask-wearing rules to fight the spread of the “worst ever” Covid iant, Omicron, this week.The new rules are set to become enforceable by penalty when a regulation change is tabled in Parliament on Monday, giving new powers which will begin on Tuesday at am. Anyone who forgets and refuses to wear a mask will face a £ fine the first time, but the charge will double for each offence. This will make it £ the second time, £ the third - up to £,. But the rules will not apply to the hospitality sector in restaurants and pubs, at concerts or events - nor can Parliament force MPs to wear them in the House of Commons.Health secretary Sajid Javid defended the system which, as last year, will allow people to half their fine by paying within the first two weeks. Speaking to Sky News he said: “Doing it in this proportionate way where itaposs for public transport, itaposs for retail outlets, I think is the right level of response on masks. “It will be via government regulation and that means, I think, that people will take it seriously. Critics have asked why the scheme only applies to shops and transport, while others warned it would be incredibly dficult to enforce. Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, told Theit would be train workers who would be left to deal with angry passengers who did not want to wear masks. He said: We support the wearing of masks but there are major issues about enforcement and it is our members left in the front line with angry passengers who refuse to comply.  He added that the Government should make “resources available to police this reintroduction of masks”, and to end its “disjointed approach and get some consistency that avoids the chaos and confusion that is a hallmark of this administration”. Shop workers and retail staff have also expressed concerns with theof the rules. James Lowman, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said: We are helping retailers to prepare for the change in face-covering rules, but they are extremely concerned about abuse against their staff from customers who donapost want to wear a face covering in a shop.  We will continue to urge stores to communicate the rules, but not to challenge those who refuse to abide by the rules. Supermarkets across the UK are now waiting on Government advice before they release further information to customers over what the rules will mean in store.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON House of CommonsBoris JohnsonPublic transportPoliticsFace Masks\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Javid said masks would become mandatory in shops and on public transport from Tuesday in England, with all international arrivals told to take PCR tests and isolate until they receive the result. All contacts with a suspected case of Omicron will have to isolate for  days - eventhey are double jabbed - as there are fears the new strain may be able to evade existing vaccines. Mr Javid said the Government hoped these changes would be temporary and said people should plan for Christmas as normal.  He told Skyaposs Trevor Phillips on Sunday: I think itaposs fair to say that the nature of this pandemic is it would be irresponsible to make guarantees. As for Christmas, I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas. I think itaposs going to be a great Christmas. Askedthe Government would introduce working from home or social distancing measures, he said: We know now those types of measures do carry a very heavy price, both economically, socially, in terms of non-Covid health outcomes such as impact on mental health. So,one was to make decisions like that they would have to be done very, very carefully and weaposre not there yet, weaposre nowhere near that. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas been asked to look at extending the booster programme to under-s, with advice expected within the next few days. Boris Johnson set out the changes at a hastily-arranged Downing Street press conference on Saturday but he was criticised for being too vague on the details.The PM has resisted imposing plan B of the Governmentaposs Covid winter plan, which also includes ordering people to work from homepossible and vaccine passports.  The new restrictions are due to be laid before Parliament on Monday, with a vote for MPs within  days.Lockdown-sceptic Tories may stage a rebellion but it is unlikely to success as Labour usually supports the Government on Covid restrictions. However Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the party wants the Government to tighten up travel restrictions. She said questions remain around the scientic advice provided on mask wearing, the very little action on ventilation in public buildings and questions on travel restrictions. Ms Nandy said: The Government is saying everyone has to have a PCR test on day two when they arrive back in the UK, but theyaposre not suggesting pre-departure tests for people before they board flights. Thereaposs no advice for people about travelling back from the airport on public transport and there are very few checks on the PCR tests that are done. So, these are all things that for months the Government has been warned about. But the doctor who discovered the Omicron iant said the UK was panicking unnecessarily and that the symptoms are extremely mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said she first encountered the iant in a man in his early s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache but none of the usual Covid symptoms. She told the BBC: What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember Iaposm at the epicentre - thataposs where Iaposm practising - itaposs extremely mild. For us, thataposs mild cases. When askedthe UK was panicking unnecessarily, she said: I think you already have it there in your country and youaposre not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely.

Heads were told to make sure they have enough supplies so all pupils can be given a lateral flow test when theyto the classroom in January. In an email to schools on Friday, the Department for Educationsaid it would help reduce transmission after a period of social mixing over the festive period.But union leaders accused the Government of treating heads like an ad hoc branch of the NHS .It comes as Britain braces to see the impact of a worrying new Covid iant first detected in South Africa, which has now been found in the UK. Two cases of the Omicron iant have been identied in Essex and Nottingham, prompting Boris Johnson to front a hastily-arranged press conference on Saturday announce new measures to halt its spread.Face coverings will be mandatory in shops and on public transport again from Tuesday, while all international arrivals will soon be required to take a more costly PCR test and isolate at home until they get their result. All contacts of an Omicron case will have to isolate at home for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. Around , pupilsin state schools were out of class due to Covid on November , down from ,on October , according to the DfE. But some schools have been forced to shut temporarily or send children home due to absence rates among staff and pupils. The Government guidance says schools should only send large numbers of children home in extreme cases and only as a last resort. On Friday, the DfE emailed school leaders to advise them to prepare for mass testing after Christmas. The email said: We would like all secondary schools to prepare to test their pupils once on-site onin January. We understand that this is a signicant additional ask but testing continues to play a vital role in keeping Covid- out of schools. Secondary schools have also been asked to order home testing kits so pupils can continue to test.  The email said: Testing all pupils in school boosts testing participation and will help reduce transmission after a period of social mixing over the school holidays. Tests, PPE and funding to support your workforce will be provided as before. After this test on , pupils should continue to test in line with Government guidelines. Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders , said: We recognise the importance of Covid testing to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, but it is not reasonable for the Government to once again impose this considerable public health task on schools with minimal support. The role of schools should be limited to providing a space for test centres and communicating with students. But the Government expects them also to handle the logistics of staffing and setting up testing stations. It seems to have forgotten that school leaders are educators rather than an ad hoc branch of the NHS. Their focus is on providing the teaching and learning required by their students, which is particularly important in the context of the disruption caused by the pandemic. The last thing they need is another huge responsibility which does not even fall within the remit of education. At the start of the autumn term, all secondary school and college pupils in England were invited to take two lateral flow tests at school on their . Pupils were then asked to continue to test twice weekly at home. A DfE spokesperson said: As part of our commitment to protecting face-to-face education, we are asking all secondary school pupils to complete one on-site test as theyto school after the Christmas break, reflecting that mixing between households is likely to increase over Christmas. Protective measures in place continue to strike a balance between managing transmission risk with testing, hygiene, ventilation and vaccines, and we encourage any eligible young people who havenapost yet had the vaccine to consider using the Christmas break to do so.

Jessica has since had five operations, three types of chemotherapy and spent y spells in hospital. Doctors decided she was too weak for any more surgery or chemotherapy and she was sent home from hospital in an ambulance for palliative care. The family of East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, were then told she may only have weeks to live.  Mum Gillian Allum, , and dad Andrew Gibson, , first became concerned when their daughteraposs right eye began moving rapidly from side to side. But initial GP referral to the hospital led to a three or four-month wait for an MRI scan followed by a drop in Jessicaaposs weight and an admission to Wishaw General Hospital in Lanarkshire on July . After an emergency MRI scan at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow, her parents were told there was a large mass in Jessica’s brain and smaller tumours in her spine. She endured three major operations in a week and also began chemotherapy. Andrew, who is an operations manager, said Jessica would be dead nowthey had waited four months for an MRI scan.He wants the NHS prioritise children showing signs of brain tumours. He told the Daily Record : “The MRI scans really need to take place within days rather than months.”Gillian, a business development manager, added: “We need to do more for children who present symptoms like Jessica’s and get their treatment fast-tracked. If the worst-case scenario happens to our daughter, I want to make sure no other family go through this.”  The couple are doing everything they can to get her better, including the use of approved herbal remedies and treatments. They are also speaking with a private consultant in Thailand who specialises in natural medicine.A JustGiving site has been set up to raise £, to support the family and pay for any possible future private procedures.One possibility is cell therapy treatment in a private London clinic, which could cost between £, and £,.

Estimates say , birds gather before sunset to exchange information about winter food sourcesStarlings display over Brighton Pier Image: Alex BamfordByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  Nov | commentsI am lucky enough to walk just  minutes from my house to witness one of the UK’s most spectacular wildle events. Between now and March, a stunning starling murmuration display takes place each evening above Brighton’s piers. Estimates say , birds gather here before sunset to exchange vital information about winter food sources, as well as to confuse predators such as sparrowhawks and peregrine falcons, before all huddling together under the Pier to keep warm through the winter nights. But, worryingly, these flocks used to contain closer to , common starlings. According to a joint study by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsand BirdLe International, one in six birds have been lost since the s. Its authors found the main reason for falling bird populations is food production and farming methods.  Professor Richard Gregory, the head of monitoring at the RSPB, said: “Farmland across Europe has become much more inhospitable to bird populations and other wildle. “The loss of these common and abundant species has cascading effects upon the ecosystem where systems are changing so rapidly that they won’t be able to sustain us, they won’t be there to provide our food or to regulate our climate. And the birds are that warning signal.” Scientists analysed data for  out of  bird species native to countries in the EU and the UK. From  to , the study estimates some  million birds have been lost, but there has also been an increase of  million in certain species. This equates to a net loss of around  million birds. The largest decline was among birds associated with agricultural land and grassland. The house sparrow population has plummeted by m, the number of yellow wagtails across the continent has fallen by m, starlings are down by % at around m, and skylarks have decreased by m. Last week, #StarlingsRoost, the south coast’s only dedicated starling observation post and cafe, inserted a see-in-the-dark camera under Brighton Pier with live feed, enabling bird watchers to observe them roosting. It is hoped the cafe, which includes murmuration artwork by local photographers and information on how to protect the birds, will help raise awareness about their plight. Caroline Lucas MP, who opened #StarlingsRoost, said she hoped it will “highlight dwindling numbers of these incredible birds, and how we can all help them survive in the future. “Simple actions like feeding garden birds through the winter, buying organic fruit and vegetables, and helping raise awareness will all make a positive dference to our local starling populations.” brightonpier eat-and-drink starlings-roost Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON European UnionRoyal Society for the Protection of BirdsCaroline Lucas MPChris PackhamFluBirdsDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Parents hit out at Tony and Beverley Flackett, who run the popular Harleyaposs Cafe and Coffee Bar, in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, for implementing the policy.The venue reopened last month after having a £, extension and refurbishment and is now home to a host of new music, film and sport memorabilia on the walls and ceilings, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.It sells toasties, paninis, wraps, sandwiches, jacket potatoes and omelettes and many proclaim its breakfasts are the best in Hanley. However, a sign outside the coffee shop publicly stating apossorry, no children under apos has riled up potential customers. Some local shoppers claim they will neverto the memorabilia-filled establishment, after being turned away for having young children with them. Tony told Stoke-on-Trent Live : We have had a no under-fives policy for  years simply because they run around, the mess they make and we donapost have the facilities in the toilets.We have signs outside on the board and on the door. I think weaposre the only place that doesnapost let under-fives in and people say they like coming here as there are no screaming kids. I know people get annoyed about it, but at the end of the day thataposs the policy. Itaposs not that we donapost want children in, just five years and older. We donapost have the space for pushchairs all over the place, weaposre not exactly a massive cafe. There are plenty of other cafes that let kids in, itaposs not like they havenapost got anywhere to go.  We had a couple of kids in this morning, they sat down and were well behaved, but children at two or three start running around and screaming. We have a lot of valuable stuff in here and we donapost want them to start messing around with them. People claimed to Stoke-on-Trent Live they have been turned away for having young children with them. Hayleigh Bloor said: Loved their food, I went in a lot while I was pregnant. Unfortunately no under-fives are allowed. Iaposd say itaposs more for the kids not to touch all their items on the walls. Nothing to do with the pram space. I think itaposs so wrong, so Iaposve not been in since as my daughter is now  months. I think itaposs more kids touching and other customers moaning about screaming babies. Emma Rayner said: I used to love this place, but one of the last times I went for breakfast I was told I couldnapost go in with my child in a pushchair. And Rachel Whalley said: They don’t allow children which doesn’t help a mother who just needs a nice coffee. I tried get in the other day but he turned me away cause I had my child with me.

The insider claims Charles then lowered his voice and asked: I mean, what do you think their childrenaposs complexion might be  Andersen writes that he asked the question in an innocent way and after Chinese whispers took hold, the comments were given a more sinister spin. Blaming a group of high-level Palace advisers known as the Men in Grey, Andersen writes: The question posed by Charles was being echoed in a less innocent way throughout the halls of Buckingham Palace. The book, out on Tuesday, also alleges that Charles told his son he was being overly sensitive about the matter. A spokesperson for the prince rubbished the claims and told The New York Post: This is fiction and not worth further comment.  The news adds fuel to the fire around the famous interview the royals did with Oprah Winfrey in March, where they alleged that a senior royal had speculated about Archieaposs complexion. The Sussexes told the TV host there had been conversations with a family member about what their unborn sonaposs skin colour would be and what that would mean or look like.  The pair chose not to reveal the identity of the perpetrator, with Meghan saying that it would be damaging for them. Harry agreed and said he would never share the full details of the discussion. Oprah later revealed it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh who made the comment, telling CBS This Morning: He did not share the identity with me but he wanted to make sure I knew, andI had an opportunity to share it, that it was not his grandmother or grandfather that were part of those conversations.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Prince Charles, Prince of WalesBuckingham PalaceRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Face masks will become mandatory again in shops and on public transport from Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said this morning.He added that he hopes the tougher rules on face coverings in England would be temporary as ministers reimpose some measures amid fears the new strain could evade existing vaccines. Boosters will be extended to younger age groups and the time between second and third jabs cut under recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation due later this week. But what is the Omicron iant  Why is it worse and how worried should we be  For answers to all those questions and more, read on...What is Omicron Omicron is the name given to the Covid iant B.... It was named by the World Health Organisation, which assigns iants of concern a Greek letter.Where did it come from It was first identied in Botswana on November  and linked to a surge in case numbers in the Gauteng province of South Africa.Why is it potentially more dangerous Omicron has  mutations on its spike protein – which allows the virus to unlock our body’s cells. It is more than double the number carried by the dominant Delta iant.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletterHow worried should we be Scientists believe the iant is highly likely to be more transmissible and has features capable of evading the vaccine antibodies. But whether catching it would lead to more severe illness will not be known for weeks. But the doctor who discovered the Omicron iant said the UK was panicking unnecessarily and that the symptoms are extremely mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told The Andrew Marr Show she first encountered the iant in a man in his early s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache, but none of the usual coronavirus symptoms. She said: What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember Iaposm at the epicentre - thataposs where Iaposm practising - itaposs extremely mild. For us, thataposs mild cases. When askedthe UK was panicking unnecessarily, she said: I think you already have it there in your country and youaposre not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now maybe we will say something dferent.What is the Government doing to stop the spread Ato mask-wearing in shops and on public transport. Airport arrivals must have a PCR test and self-isolate until they are confirmed to be virus-free. Close contacts of Omicron patients must also self-isolate, and there are plans to expand the booster jab programme. When can I get my booster Over-s, health and social workers, and those with underlying health conditions are already entitled to a third jab. Rolling out the programme to under-s requires the sign-off from the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations.Can the existing vaccines be tweaked Moderna and Novavax were already beginning work to tweak their vaccines, while Pfizer and BioNTech said that – in the event of a iant arriving which evades existing jabs – they expect to be able to “develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that iant in approximately  days, subject to regulatory approval”.Which countries are now on the red list Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola join South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia.

But after collapsing at home with Covid, James Grayson, , is in a coma and fighting for le. Eldest daughter Ebonnie, , said: “We are all broken beyond words. “He was really healthy, he would go to the gym all the time. We’d never have thought something like this could have affected him so severely.” We Becky, , said yesterday: “James was never poorly and never had a day off work in his le. It’s heartbreaking to see him like that. “He’s not showing any signs of improvement. The doctors tell me his survival rate is %. “I’m an absolute emotional wreck.”  James had no known underlying health conditions. He was waiting for his second Covid vaccine when he fell ill with the virus on October .Since then he has suffered other complications including a collapsed lung, sepsis, blood clots and pneumonia.James has been transferred from his local hospital, Frimley Park in Surrey, to Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, where he is on one of the UK’s five specialist Ecmo machines. The device temporarily takes over the work of the heart and lungs, pumping blood from the body to an articial lung that adds oxygen to it and removes carbon dioxide. Becky, who got together with James  years ago before they married in , added: “We are in absolute hell. “When I manage to get some sleep I keep dreaming that Jim is home and well. Then I wake and it’s like a smack in the face as reality hits me. “All of the children are devastated and missing their dad terribly.

I get them all the time seeing people dead, and I just burst out crying. It can be loud noises, things on the telly, the Liverpool bomb. Visual things. I need someone to go into my head and stop them.” It’s two years on Monday since John Crilly became a hero, just for one day. He was attending an ex-offenders education conference in Fishmonger Hall in London, when one of the other attendees began stabbing people with knives attached to each wrist. Usman Khan opened his coat to reveal he was wearing a suicide vest, which he threatened to detonate.  Images of John turning a fire extinguisher on Khan on London Bridge – while another attendee chased him with a Narwhal tusk grabbed from a wall and a third man tried to grab him – went viral all over the world.Incredibly, he had the presence of mind to think that by spraying him with the hydrant he might be able to soak the suicide belt and short-circuit it. Khan’s terror attack ended when John and others jumped on Khan, still believing his suicide vest was about to detonate on one of London’s busiest bridges. The Jihadi was then shot dead by police, and his suicide belt revealed to be fake. “That first day we were heroes,” John remembers. “Then by day two we were murderers.”John was attending the conference because he has a previous conviction for manslaughter, after a burglary when he was a young man addicted to drugs, went wrong.Steven Gallant, who also tackled Khan and helped end the killing spree, was on day release from a sentence for murder. “The reaction afterwards showed the narrative never changes,” John says. “No matter how many times I said, ‘I’m not a murderer’, it never made any dference.”  The third man on the bridge was Darryn Frost, a communications officer in the Ministry of Justice, who chased Khan with a ft ornamental Narwhal Tusk grabbed from the wall.John says they all keep in touch in a Whatsapp group as they struggle to deal with the aftermath.With the death of Khan’s two victims, John lost his friend Jack Merritt and he witnessed Saskia Jones’ murder.He had been in the team that collected Khan from his train station that morning, a man sweating in a huge coat. He fought with Khan using a wooden lectern, a heavy chair and eventually the fire hydrant. “I started spraying him and at first it seemed to do the job,” he told me at the time. “I was spraying it in his eyes. He was all covered in foam and then he came bursting through it again with the knives.” Two years on, John says he barely sleeps and has frequent flashbacks to seeing Saskia fatally wounded by Khan. “I can’t eat,” he says. “It’s hard for me to feel positive about anything. I was never a great sleeper, but it’s got a lot worse.” For someone in recovery, this is a dangerous path. “I’ve been finding it hard not to relapse since Fishmongers Hall,” John says. “It’s a form of self-harm really.” John has been hurt and angered by the multiple failings revealed during the inquest into Jack Merritt and Saskia’s deaths. Liverpool, he says, proves nothing has changed. “Where’s the lessons been learned when you see what happened in Liverpool  “I’m used to errors in the justice system, but the errors that came out in the inquest from every department, were mind-blowing. How much they missed was madness.  “I can’t get my head around it. They just all thought some other department will do it. The errors were ridiculous.” Meanwhile, he says he and Steve have been treated dferently to the others there on that day. “Everyone apart from me and Steve that I’ve spoken to have got criminal compensation, but we can’t because of our criminal records. Apparently, you become a member of society again after prison, but that hasn’t happened to us.” Last month, John, Darryn and Steven were given Police High Commendations for Bravery, with Cressida Dick praising his “selfless heroism”, but he says he couldn’t bring himself to shake her hand. “I didn’t even want to go after everything that came out at the inquest,” John says. “Cressida Dick put her hand, but I couldn’t take it. I said it was Covid but it’s because I blame the police. I’ve never had good experiences with the police to be honest. The first time I met a police officer when I was , he kicked the sh*t out of me. And a lot of things recently have put them in a bad light.” A former heroin user, John had been part of a Manchester burglary in , that went fatally wrong when his co-defendant killed Augustine Maduemezia, , with a single punch. It’s a day he deeply regrets. Jack Merritt, the inspirational young man from Learning Together, had been critical to John turning his le around. They met when John was studying for a law degree in prison, and Jack was a law student visiting the jail. John became his prison mentor.  Jack had come to John’s graduation, and they became friends. “If I’d met Jack much earlier in my le, maybe things would have been dferent,” John told me after the murders. Over the past two years, John has been supported by JENGbA , a charity already involved in his case before the attack. It campaigns on the controversial ‘Joint Enterprise laws’ that saw John convicted jointly for the crime of another person. “JENGbA are there to pick me up and pull me along and my family’s on the phone, that gives me a bit of hope,” he says. “My eldest son came to the commendation ceremony. It’s something for them to be proud of, and there hasn’t been much.” He also says he is in regular touch with Jack Merritt’s dad, sharing a meal with him before the commendation. Steven Gallant was on day release at Fishmonger Hall, serving a -year sentence for the murder of ex-firefighter Barrie Jackson in Hull. His sentence was reduced by  months by the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland because of his bravery on London Bridge meaning he has now been released.  “I’ve got an appeal in with the Criminal Cases Review Commission,” John says. “I got an -year sentence for manslaughter, which lawyers believe was disproportionate. JENGbA have spoken to the Ministry of Justice about reducing my licence after what happened at Fishmongers Hall, but there’s been no decision in eight months.” Meanwhile Jack Merritt’s family are bringing a claim under the Human Rights Act that states that “Usman Khan was a convicted terrorist under multi-agency public protection when he killed Jack and Saskia on  November … These circumstances raise questions about the assessment and management of Usman Khan’s risk.”John says he will mark Monday’s anniversary by take part in #CreatingWithJack on Instagram, an initiative set up by Jack’s parents. “I’m going to splash some paint about for a picture,” he says.He will spend the day thinking about the two kind, inspirational young people who died that day. “Because he winsyou think anything other than positive thoughts about Jack and Saskia,” he says. “And Khan’s took enough”. After the terror attack, David Merritt accused the government of using his son’s death to further their “agenda of hate”. Two years on, his son’s belief that people can change may have been betrayed by Khan but his faith in John Crilly has not.

Hotel cleaner Leslie Southam lives with his elderly parents in a red-brick home kept with pride in the middle of Brynmefys, an estate a couple of miles from Llanelli town centre. The family have lived there since the mid s when it was a bustling community but the remaining homes couldnapost be further from Leslieaposs childhood memories.The attached property is being swallowed by a tree, its door boarded up and its windowsills decaying, reports WalesOnline. He believes that we are in the last days before Jesus Christapossto Earth and the apocalypse. The way things are going, itaposs only going to be seven years at most, he told WalesOnline.  It is one of  properties in a similar — or worse — condition on the estate, which began emptying in the s as the council floated plans to develop the area. Carcasses of homes are rotting, roofs collapsing, nature taking back the land and windows smashed. The streets are fenced off in places and have piles of rubbish dumped where, while the sign for the abandoned community hall rusts and fades.  Leslie, , was born in Cardigan and moved to Brynmefys with his English parents aged seven. Their home is now one of only three on the estate still occupied. A couple of cars parked on the road are a reminder of le. Leslie said: To be honest itaposs quite nice here. Itaposs quiet. My mumaposs  and my dadaposs . They like it here. I am past caring. I donapost think anything will ever be done. Carmarthenshire council have been doing the same thing over and over for years. They seem to get money for this and that, then it disappears. Weaposve had lots of dferent schemes but nothing has ever been done. And itaposs ended up like this.  He says he doesnapost really miss the Brynmefys of his childhood, an estate absolutely full with cars and people and children. While remembering the estate of yesteryear and explaining the current situation Leslie says there is another reason he has given up on development plans – he believes the world will end in seven years. When he explains why his dad bought their home under Right to Buy in  he says: He was buying it for the plot rather than the house. It was either rent for the rest of your le or buy this. He got it for almost nothing. You wouldnapost even buy a car for it.  After the scheme to redevelop the estate fell through in the late s many homes were derelict and unfit for renting. Thanks to a grant in the s Leslieaposs family were able to make key renovations to theirs but many other occupied houses were also falling into disrepair. His and the two other households on the estate live in privately owned homes but the land Brtnmefys is built on is council-owned.  The estate is in Carmarthenshire, the county with the most empty homes in Walesbut also the fastest rising house prices, which surged by  per cent to £, in the year to March. But the council has repeatedly failed to sell the estate and plans for developments have fallen through. Now a protected species of bats occupy many of the homes making demolition a tough task. A full report on the scale of the problem is due in January.  The sewage network is also not up to scratch and fixing it would require buying out the current owners. But the councilaposs offers have been rejected despite the fact Leslie says his parents would consider selling for the right price. Media coverage of the estate has led to an influx of teenagers who turn up in cars thinking the area may be haunted. Fences with aposdanger - keep outapos warnings pinned to them have been erected as a result. Leslie said: For some reason kids in their late teens were always turning up thinking there were ghosts here. They would come in their cars on weekends and try to get into the houses. Now a security guard waits here at night every weekend.

People were filmed staring in awe at the enormous waves as they crashed up against the walls of the promenade in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. But one man got a quick and cold shock when the surging water engulfed the path - and then him - as he ran for his le. The man could be seen stood gripping onto a wall as the wave retreated, covered head to toe in white sea foam - but was branded an idiot online for getting dangerously close to the waves. One user commented: Idiot all it takes is half decent wave and your dragged  yards out.  Storm Arwen has already claimed the lives of three men, who were killed by falling trees as winds of up to mph were recorded on Friday. Popular headteacher, Francis Lagan, was believed to be driving with his we and children when he was killed by an uprooted tree in Co Antrim, Northern Ireland. A -year-old man in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, died when his pick up truck was struck by a tree, and a man from Lancaster was also killed as gusts ripped down trees in Cumbria. The Met Office issued red weather warnings for wind in several parts of the country and police forces urged people to only travelnecessary.Tens of thousands of homes were left without power and rail passenger and pub goers were left stranded as a result of heavy snowfall. Punters at the Tan Hill Inn in the Yorkshire Dales are set to spend a second night sleeping on the pub floor after they were snowed in on Friday.  After driving up to the th century inn, which is the highest pub in Britain, many customers were left shocked to discover their cars completely engulfed in snow and had to bed in for the night. Now the unrelenting weather conditions could see them forced to spend another night away from home as a fallen power line and heavy snow continues to block the main routes out. Britain is bracing for even more wintry conditions in the weeks ahead with snow forecast again in the first two weeks of December and Met Office yellow warnings for ice in place until Monday.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeSnowTidal wavesStorms\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Six-month-old tabby Dave caused chaos at Tracey Goreeaposs Lincoln home, crashing into the tin and covering himself and much of the room in paint. The -year-old full-time carer rushed downstairs to a scene of devastation. She said: I heard a noise from the kitchen and knew straight away that Dave was up to mischief. I slowly got up as I was talking to my partner at the time and as Dave had already been messing about in the sink, I wasnapost too worried. She added: Suddenly I heard a crash so I rushed into the kitchen to be met with a sauntering, paint splashed kitten and complete devastation. I remember a panicked aposoh my god, no! No, no, no, no!!apos and covering my wide open mouth with my hand. It was absolute bloody chaos! My partner and I had pots of paint on the side ready for decorating. One paint pot was on top of another and probably had a slightly loose lid.  Little Daveaposs antics took the couple hours to clean up. Tracy added: I scooped up the worst bit with a dustpan and a piece of stf cardboard whilst my partner showered Dave. When he came down we both got a bucket of warm water and washing up liquid for the floor. The paint everywhere  was already starting to dry so we poured salt on the worst of it.  This acts as an abrasive and we were able to scrub clean the worktop, kettle, toaster and bread bin. It was midnight by then so we decided the rest could wait until we decorate. It took two of us two-and-a-half hours to clean up. But despite his mischievous ways, Tracey says Dave is a very lovable kitten. She said: Dave is cute, sweet, adorable and very loving. We rescued his mum and sister when she was just pregnant so Dave has been with us since day one.

The classic dish often features roast meat, Yorkshire puddings, roasted or boiled veg and naturally lashings of gravy. And a huge pile of golden, crispy roast potatoes, with a perfect fluffy inside, of course. We all have our methods -with some chefs swearing by goose fat, while others simply use olive oil.Now Nigella has shared her view, Leicestershire Live reports.The national treasure says people can transform their potatoes into golden delicious nuggets with just a few ingredients - salt and pepper, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here And she steams them for about  minutes before they get put in the oven to ensure they have an earth-shattering crunch.“While steaming then roasting potatoes may seem rather a fandango, one bite of these will convince you that itaposs utterly worth it besides, itaposs not asyou have to do anything while they either steam or roast,” she wrote on Instagram.“Go slowly when adding the salt and vinegar, tasting as you go, as I like these to have the wincing hit of salt and vinegar crisps, and you may prefer a lighter hand with the sprinkling.” They were met with a note of approval on social media, as one fan raved: This is the KEY to ensuring your spuds are perfectly fluffy.

Two cases in the UK were found in Nottingham and Brentwood, Essex, both of which are believed to have been contracted in South Africa.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the emergence of Omicron showed the pandemic is far from over during a hastily convened No press conference on Friday.Rules in England have changed to make face masks mandatory again in shops and on public transport from Tuesday, and travellers arriving into the UK will now need to have a PCR test done within two days of arrival. Scientists have said they are concerned about the B... iant as it has around  dferent mutations - which is double the number present in the Delta iant. How  is this new iant dferent from previous versions and how dangerous is it  When did it first appear  UK scientists first became aware of the new strain on November  after samples were uploaded on to a coronavirus iant tracking website from South Africa, Hong Kong and then Botswana.A total of  samples have been uploaded to the website so far. Three samples are from Hong Kong, three are from Botswana and the rest are from South Africa. On Friday, it was confirmed that cases had been identied in Israel and Belgium and on Saturday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said two cases had been found in the UK.What are the symptoms of the new iant The doctor who discovered the Omicron iant said the UK was panicking unnecessarily and that the symptoms are extremely mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told The Andrew Marr Show she first encountered the iant in a man in his early s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache, but none of the usual coronavirus symptoms. She said: What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember Iaposm at the epicentre - thataposs where Iaposm practising - itaposs extremely mild. For us, thataposs mild cases. When askedthe UK was panicking unnecessarily, she said: I think you already have it there in your country and youaposre not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now maybe we will say something dferent. How is Omicron dferent from the other iants Despite only being tracked for the past five days, the virus has already been found to have  dferent mutations. The mutations contain features seen in all of the other iants but also traits that have not been seen before. Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said: We will continue to work closely with the international community to quickly gather and analyse information on this iant to understand any possible increase in transmissibility or resistance to vaccines. It is important that everyone takes sensible precautions - get a PCR testyou have symptoms, isolate when asked, wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces, ventilate rooms, get your vaccine and boosters as soon as you can.Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser of the UK Health Security Agency , told BBC Radio aposs Today Programme: If we look at those mutations, thereaposs mutations that increase infectivity, mutations that evade the immune response both from vaccines and from natural immunity, mutations that cause increased transmissibility.Itaposs a highly complex mutation, thereaposs also new ones that we have never seen before. Will the vaccines protect people against Omicron It is too early to say. Work is under way to see whether the new iant may be causing new infection in people who have already had coronavirus or a vaccine, or whether waning immunity may be playing a role. Professor James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, has said the new iant will almost certainly make vaccines less effective, though they would still offer protection. Pfizer BioNTech, which has produced a vaccine against Covid-, is already studying the new iantaposs ability to evade vaccines. Experts have said vaccines can be tweaked to tackle new iants as they emerge. Mr Javid said: We know this is new out there. We donapost know enough about it yet. But for what we do know, we know that the protections that we have, especially the vaccines, are hugely important.What do we know about the cases in the UK There are two known cases of Omicron in the UK that have been traced back to southern Africa. Updated information from Essex County Council said the cases, which are linked, are in Brentwood and Nottingham and those who tested positive are self-isolating and contact tracing is being carried out. Mr Javid said targeted testing and sequencing of positive cases in the affected areas will take place. He said anyone who has travelled to the  countries placed on the red travel list - Angola, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia - in the last  days must isolate and take a PCR test. He said: This is a real reminder to us all that this pandemic is far from over. Andthereaposs one thing that everyone can be doing right now is,theyaposre eligible, please take your vaccine when itaposs your first shot, your second shot, or your booster jab. If youaposre eligible, please take a vaccine. He described the new iant as deeply concerning, and said: I think the importance of them, especially the booster vaccine, is now even more important. Have any countries been put on the red list in relation to Omicron Yes. Flights from South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini and Zimbabwe were suspended from midday on Friday and all six countries have been added to the red list. On Saturday, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia were also placed on the red list. Mr Javid told the House of Commons on Friday that discussions are ongoing on whether more countries should be added to the list.What does this mean for travellers  The UK and Scottish governments and Northern Ireland Executive said on Thursday that UK and Irish residents who arrived between midday on Friday and am on Sunday, and who have been in the  countries within the last  days, must quarantine at home for  days and take NHS PCR tests on day two and day eight, eventhey already have a lateral flow test booked.Passengers - including UK and Irish residents - arriving from am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a Government-approved hotel and quarantine for  days. They must also take tests on day two and day eight. Direct flights from the  nations to the UK are being temporarily banned until am on Sunday, for the quarantine hotels to be set up. Since midday on Friday, non-UK and Irish residents who have visited the nations in the previous  days have been refused entry into England. Residents in the Republic of Ireland will also have to undergo testing and quarantiningthey have recently ed from South Africa. The Irish Government has it will align with the EU recommendation to apply the emergency brake and to discourage travel to or from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, Angola, Malawi and Zambia. Other countries including Germany, Italy, France, Israel, Japan and Singapore have also restricted travel over the iant.How worried should we be about this iant There are fears the virus transmits more easily and that it could be more deadly and evade vaccines. However, scientists have said it is too early to confirmall of these fears are correct. They are eager to acquire live virus cultures so it can be examined, but this takes time. It can take seven to  days at least to grow enough virus that can be shared with other scientists so they can study how it mutates and changes. Officials will now also have to wait for data to come from South Africa. The earliest they are expecting evidence to come through is two to three weeks, but it could be as long as four to six weeks.

Buckingham Palace has denied it was Prince CharlesThe Duchess of Sussex talks with Prince Charles at the Westminster Abbey Commonwealth day service Image: Richard PohleByLeigh Mcmanus:,  Nov Prince Charles has reportedly called in his lawyers after he was accused of being the aposroyal racistapos alluded to by Harry and Meghan in their bombshell Oprah interview. The couple made headlines across the world in March when they suggested a senior member of the royal family asked what colour Archieaposs skin would be. Brothers And Wives: Inside The Private Lives of William, Kate, Harry and Meghan, a book by author Christopher Andersen, has now claimed Charles, , was the royal. A spokesperson for the Prince of Wales has strongly denied the claims, stating: “This is fiction and not worth further comment.” The book claims Charles questioned what his grandchildaposs complexion might look like during a conversation with we Camilla over breakfast. The alleged discussion supposedly took place on the morning Harry and Meghanaposs engagement was officially announced, November , , the book states.  A source told the royal author that Charles allegedly said to Camilla: I wonder what the children will look like. The book claims she was somewhat taken aback by the comment, and responded: Well, absolutely gorgeous, Iaposm certain. The insider also claimed Charles then lowered his voice and asked: I mean, what do you think their childrenaposs complexion might be  Andersen wrote that “scheming courtiers” then gave Charles’ alleged words “a racist spin”. A Page Six report claimed the alleged conversation then “reached toxic proportions” by the time Harry and Meghan were informed.Charles, according to The Sun, is calling in the lawyers over the claims in the book. An insider told The Sun: “The claims are utterly ridiculous. “There is more of a concern that commenting on it will simply sell more books than actually damage Charles’ reputation.” Buckingham Palace said last night: “We don’t comment on books of this kind as to do so risks giving it some form of authority or credibility.” After the interview with Oprah in March, Harry agreed and said he would never share the full details of the discussion. Oprah later revealed it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh who made the comment, telling CBS This Morning: He did not share the identity with me but he wanted to make sure I knew, andI had an opportunity to share it, that it was not his grandmother or grandfather that were part of those conversations.

Met Office forecasters say they expect to see the mercury falling below zero in many parts of the country, including in cities such as London, where it could be -C in the late hours of Sunday. Many parts of the country have also been given snow warnings - with up to cm predicted to fall in the capital. It has also issued two yellow ice warnings - one across eastern parts of Scotland and another stretching from the north-east of England down to the south coast - from Sunday afternoon.  The warnings, set to last until Monday morning, say people should expect to see icy patches on roads and pavements, meaning accidents and slips and falls are more likely. Many parts of the country fell below freezing to around - C overnight, with Shap in Cumbria hitting -.C.It comes after Storm Arwen wreaked havoc across much of the UK, bringing strong winds, sleet and snow. Met Office forecaster Tom Morgan said: As Storm Arwen is clearing out to Europe, a cold northerly flow of wind has been left behind in the UK, causing some of the bitterly cold temperatures weaposve seen.There is set to be further wintry weather on Sunday, with snow expected to fall across areas in Scotland and northern England, and even in parts of southern and central England.Parts of Scotland and northern England, where snow is on the ground, will be very cold again tonight, with the temperature certainly falling below zero and even as low as minus C , which would make it the coldest night of the season so far. Though this is expected to be the exception rather than the rule, temperatures of below freezing will be widespread, including in London and the South East which could hit -C. Evenyou do live in a city, you can expect to be scraping frost, ice or even snow off your cars on Monday morning. Mr Morgan added that, although frost will also be seen in Wales and Northern Ireland, temperatures there will not fall as low as England and Scotland. A cold weather alert was issued by the UK Health Security Agency on Friday, remaining in place until Monday, prompting advice to people to try to stay warm and look out for those most at risk from the effects of the chilly conditions such as the elderly and anyone with heart and lung problems. Mr Morgan said this is due to an Arctic shot which has moved south across the UK.The cold spell comes after three people were killed when trees were blown over by strong winds as Storm Arwen hit on Friday. Gusts of almost mph also caused transport disruption, power cuts and damage to buildings, while heavy snow led to lorries getting stuck and ploughs being used in a number of areas.

Data released by the Department of Health this afternoon shows a further , recorded infections in the latest  hour period. That is a . percent decrease on last Sundayaposs total of , positive cases. While a further  people died within  days of testing positive today in the UK, the data also shows. Itaposs a decrease on this time last weekaposs  infection-related fatalities. In total, there are ,, cases in the UK and there have been , deaths.It comes after UK Covid cases surged above , per day again this week. Have you been affected by the new travel ban  Let us know at webnews@mirror The UK Health Security Agency said on Sunday that there are three cases of the new Omicron iant in Britain, adding that the inidual, who was no longer in Britain, was linked to travel to Southern Africa. UKHSA said that while in Britain, the inidual was in Westminster in central London. Jenny Harries, chief executive of UKHSA, said in a statement: It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focused contact tracing. This follows the news that Spain has announced that unvaccinated British tourists will be banned from entering, after Portugal said even double-jabbed tourists would need proof of a negative test to cross the borders. The tightening-up of regulations governing entry to the UK’s favourite foreign holiday destination comes into force on Wednesday, ending an exemption which means travellers without their Covid jabs could enter Spain with a negative test or proof of recovery from Covid. The Spanish government confirmed the change in an official state bulletin published on Saturday.The decision was taken before confirmation that the new Omicron coronavirus iant had been detected in several European countries.Boris Johnson has reacted to the Omicron threat by enforcing day-two PCR tests for arrivals in Britain and making facemasks compulsory in shops and trains.Fears over the latest incarnation of Covid shot up rapidly when a patient in Belgium fell ill with the B... iant, first detected in South Africa.  Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said: We have one case of this iant that is confirmed. Itaposs someone who came from abroad. The patient has no known links with South Africa, but had travelled to Belgium from Egypt. Marc Van Ranst, whose laboratory works closely with Belgiumaposs public health body Sciensano, said the person first developed symptoms on November . Flights from South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini and Zimbabwe were temporarily banned from noon yesterday and UK travellers told to quarantine.  The red list was previously scrapped earlier this month when all countries were taken off it. Scientists sounded the alarm on Thursday night over the B... iant, which has the potential to evade immunity built up by vaccination or prior infection - and has been dubbed worst weaposve seen so far. Three cases have been identied so far in Britain and officials have raised concern over a rapid rise in cases in South Africa. People who have arrived from the country in the last  days will be invited to take a test.On confirming the ban, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the new strain may be more transmissible than the Delta strain and the vaccines that we currently have may be less effective.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Department of Health\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Glynn Steel faced a two-week battle in intensive care and begged nurses for the jab as he fought for his le, but it was too late to save him. His last words to we Emma were: I have never felt so ill, I wish Iaposd had the vaccine. Glynn from Malvern, Worcestershire, was two months from his th birthday when he died on November .He had planned to retire and spend more time travelling and looking after animals.Emma, , who is double-jabbed, says she is now facing an empty future alone and has called on everyone to take the vaccine. I insist to everyone I know to get the vaccine, she said. The last thing Glynn said to me was ‘I have never felt so ill, I wish that I had had the vaccine’. It was heart wrenching.  He begged for the vaccine when he was in intensive care before he went on le support but they said that it was too late. Iaposve been crying myself into a dehydration every night, and letting the tears flow like a river in the morning and waking up in the night crying. Itaposs having to tell people that loved him that they will never see him again, and seeing that pain in them. I’m used to trying to make people laugh, not cry. He was a very gentle soul, he was a vegan and didnapost want the Covid vaccine because it was tested on animals. Glynn, a field service engineer, cared for a total of six rescued cats and dogs at his home in Malvern, Worcs., and even brought a dog in need back from a holiday in Sri Lanka. He was hesitant to receive the vaccine after reading that producers including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson  Johnson had tested theirs on animals. Glynn had started off with just a cold which gradually got worse and he tested positive for Covid on October . He deteriorated rapidly because of his age and lack of vaccine. And his we called an ambulance but none were available and she had to take her unconscious -stone husband to hospital herself. She said there were  ambulances queuing outside Worcestershire Royal Hospital when she arrived with him. Emma added: I still donapost know how I got him in my car. He was so heavy that I couldnapost even push him in a wheelchair at the hospital. Eventually a young lad appeared and offered to help, he was there because his mum was also unwell and couldnapost get an ambulance either, so he had to bring her to the hospital like I did. Glynn was quickly admitted to intensive care but by the th he was put on le support and in an induced coma. Emma said: I was with him when he died. I was wearing a full PPE kit so I couldnapost touch him, but they played his favourite music by the Sex Pistols and I stayed with him until the end. Glynn died within  minutes of le his le support being turned off. Despite two weeks passing, Emma says she still cannot imagine le without him. I will forever miss our friendship, our partnership, our love, and our connection to each other, she said.Glynn’s niece Charlotte Steel has launched a Gofundme page to raise money for the funeral.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HospitalsAnimalsCoronavirus vaccineCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Faye Harding tipped the scales at st lbs and used to eat a multipack of crisps and two huge takeaways a week. But after seeing a photo of herself she decided to take action, switching to a diet plan and losing three stone in just two months before discovering her ex was cheating on her. But rather than pushing the -year-old back towards unhealthy choices Faye used it to spur her on and she lost another four stone. She built up her strength with weights, started the Couch to k programme and in just  months dropped to st lbs. The insurance worker from Chipping Sodbury, Bristol, said: “I’d go so far as to say that I was addicted, I’d be eating non-stop no matter what the emotion. “Every time I ate, it gave me a temporary high, and I craved that. “I ended up wanting to lose weight when my mum took a picture of me last year, and I just looked at it and felt awful about myself. But I knew I couldnapost do it alone so I started The : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan, I noticed that the weight was just falling off me. “I lost three stone within two months and then I found out my ex was cheating on me. But I refused to use food as a coping mechanism. It spurred me on even more to try and shed the weight, as well as taking the time to focus on myself.  Faye used to consume over , calories per day - eating full sharer bags of cheese Doritos and full packs of biscuits, alongside large portion meals each day. She would spend up to £ a week on snacks and bad food habits alone each week, on top of the weekly food shop. She said: “I loved crisps they were my favourite snack. “I’d easily be eating two or more packs a day, alongside a sharer bag a week. “The Pringles logo is quite true really, once I had a bag of crisps open, I couldn’t stop. “I’d be having about two takeaways a week, with all the trimmings,I got a curry, I’d have the naan bread, poppadom’s, rice, chips and a starter. Faye turned to The : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan, which substitutes large portion meals and bad snacking habits with shakes and healthy alternatives. She said: “I started running, which was dficult at first, but I definitely started to notice a dference, especially with the muscles in my legs. “I invested in some weights and built my strength up to do the Couch To K scheme which helped me lose another two stone. “With the diet, I was eating and drinking  calories a day which is a lot less than my intake originally. “Instead of three pieces of toast and sausage bap for breakfast, I’d be having a smoothie or porridge. “The : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan has given me a new appreciation for food. “I eat so much healthier now, and focus a lot on proteins, I really enjoy cooking and experimenting with healthy greens.” Faye is now thriving, she has recently become a homeowner and has a doting partner called Chris Moore, , who is a tech delivery manager. She said: “I’ve finally reached a goal weight that I can maintain. “A lot of my friends were shocked as they didn’t realise just how big I was, and they can’t believe the dference. “I can’t believe how far I’ve come, I’ve even had to buy a whole new wardrobe. Some people have said I should send a photo to my ex, but I donapost care. I did this for me!

Today Dutch authorities confirmed that  passengers on a flight from South Africa had tested positive for the mutant strain. It means at least  countries have confirmed cases, with several others investigating suspected instances. It comes after Belgium became the first European country to announce it had identied the strain on Friday, while health officials in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic have identied suspected Omicron cases. It has sparked a new wave of travel restrictions, with further countries likely to bring in measures to limit the spread of the iant. Experts across the world are scrambling to determine whether Omicron is more deadly and whether it evades vaccines. News of the iantaposs spread have prompted alarm among world leaders, with Israel bringing in a blanket ban on international travellers. The iant has now been detected in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, South Africa, Australia, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong.  Additionally health authorities in the Czech Republic yesterday said they believed they had identied cases, and were carrying out tests to confirm this. Austria is also investigated suspected instances of the iant within its borders.Yesterday Health Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed that two cases of the mutant strain had been found in the UK - one in Brentwood, Essex, and the other in Nottingham.Last night Switzerland was among the first to respond to the UKaposs announcement by stating that people arriving from these shores would have to isolate for  days, even after testing negative. This morning officials in Australia announced two cases of the iant had been found in passengers arriving in Sydney from southern Africa.  Both were asymptomatic, fully vaccinated and in quarantine, health officials in New South Wales said. It follows in the footsteps of Germany and Italy confirming their own Omicron cases. The German state of Baia announced two confirmed cases of the iant yesterday. Meanwhile In Italy, the National Health Institute said a case of the new iant had been detected in Milan in a person coming from Mozambique. On Friday Belgian authorities said a person travelling into the country from Egypt had been found to have the new Covid strain.  It is feared that the emergence of the Omicron iant, described by scientists as the most complex mutation yet, could prolong the pandemic further. Israel said it would ban the entry of all foreigners into the country and reintroduce counter-terrorism phone-tracking technology to contain the spread of the iant. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement that the ban, pending government approval, would last  days. Interior minister Ayelet Shaked said: Our working hypotheses are that the iant is already in nearly every country, and that the vaccine is effective, although we donapost yet know to what degree.Yesterday Boris Johnson announced that people arriving in the UK from abroad would have to do a PCR test and isolate until they have confirmation of a negative result. The iant, classied as of concern by the World Health Organisation , was first detected in South Africa, but it is not known where it originated. Following its discovery countries across the world, including the UK, slapped travel restrictions on the country and a number of its neighbours. South African officials have hit back, saying they are being penalised for scientic excellence.Many countries have slapped restrictions on ious southern African countries over the past couple of days, including Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Iran, Australia, New Zealand and the US, in response to warnings over the transmissibility of the new iant.The UK put South Africa, Botswana, Lesostho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia on its red list on Friday, and yesterday added Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola. Switzerland yesterday widened its quarantine rules to travellers arriving from Britain, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Egypt and Malawi, its health ministry said. Anyone travelling from these countries will need need to present a negative Covid- test and quarantine for  days as well, the Federal Office of Public Health said in a tweet.

Image: Chris BirseByRosaleen FentonAudience WriterLee Grimsditch:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | comments A Lord of the Ringsenthusiast has expressed his devotion to the Tolkein franchise in a very unique way.Artist Chris Birse, , has spent hundreds of hours creating intricately-detailed maps of UK regions inspired by the fictional world of Middle Earth.He spoke to the Liverpool Echo about his time spent recreating Merseyside into a Middle Earth fantasy that would impress any Tolkien aficionado.Chris said: I started making maps about three years ago now. I was writing a fantasy novel at the time and I needed a map at the start of the book to show where the characters were going, that kind of thing. I thought rather than paying someone , I would give it a go myself just for the hell of it.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here So as a practice, I did my home region of Teeside in that style and just got a lot of positive feedback from it and I thought maybe this could be the direction to take things. After recreating his home region in the style, Chris has gone to recreate other countries and smaller UK regions, in a bid to include places of interest.Chris said: I post a lot on Facebook so I do a work in progress when Iaposm halfway through and Iaposve got all the major settlements and locations in.I share that in ious places and say to people, what  do you want to see on there.  I get a lot of feedback in that sense because you get loads of people commenting and messaging just saying can you put this local barrow in. A few of the shipwrecks as well - a lot of people were asking for them. I was like thataposs a quality suggestion actually, Iaposll stick that in I wouldnapost have thought of that. I could easily go and google the top  or  things to see or do in Merseyside, get your main things, but you never get your details like your shipwrecks and stuff so reaching out to the local community is great. I enjoyed all the history and all the dferent time periods. Going from Medieval and Roman to quite modern things as well, which I am quite happy to include. I try and tweak them to make them fit the fantasy theme as well. The ex-Aldi worker spent  hours on the map featuring Merseyside and made sure to include the regionaposs iconic landmarks past and present. He now sends prints of his creations on his Etsy store, ranging in size from A to A, as well as large canvas prints. You can find Chrisapos Etsy store by clicking here . Chris added: Iaposm going around the whole of the UK and trying to do all the counties in that style. Itaposs going to take a while. I want to get all the counties done and compile them into one massive fantasy atlas. Weaposre talking years down the line but thataposs the goal, I think.

The Roses tin sampled appears to be even numbers allowing for a iation in the tin filling. I agree Quality Street appears to be uneven. More data please.

Keen to make the place feel more homely, she stripped out the old carpets to reveal rustic floorboards, which she then painted white, with permission from the landlord.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Picking a “feminine and uplting” colour palette to replace the magnolia, the mum-of-two added pops of colour into every room - spending a total of £, on the renovation. “When I first arrived, the cottage was all magnolia, but structurally sound,” Emma said. I knew I wanted to inject colour with a boho style enjoying plenty of plants throughout the house.” The first room Emma tackled was the lounge, where she spent £ overhauling the furniture with “retro” secondhand buys and creating a feature wallpapered wall. She said: “I first decorated the lounge with a colour palette of green, pink, soft pink and vivid pink. “The walk-in fireplace also had exposed brick which I freshened up with some white paint and I created a feature wall with wallpaper gted by Lust home.  “I removed the curtains and replaced them with a natural branch with plants hanging from it, I’ve also created this in my bedroom. “The windows are very pretty to look at plus the view is incredible, so I didn’t want to hide either of these with curtains.” In the kitchen, Emma spent just £ and uses her creative skills to paint a bright pink and aquamarine mural across one of the walls. The mum said: “The kitchen was the first room where I painted one of my murals on the wall. All my murals are hand-painted and original. It is very much floral-themed and uses bright but soothing colours. “The use of plants continues into the kitchen where I’ve hung a reclaimed ladder from the ceiling with flowers hanging from it.” Emma, who has done all of the work herself, began DIYing her home as a way to deal with the grief of suddenly losing her dad in .Documenting her home’s transformation on her Instagram account@tallulahcottage, which now has , followers, Emma has shared her hard work with her followers. She said: “In my bedroom, I’ve removed the carpet and exposed the floorboards and painted them white. “I have a reclaimed piece of wood above my bed which acts as a shelf and my main wall is painted Miami mint with a feature flower arrangement on it which gets a lot of love on Instagram. “The window is exposed with another branch hanging from the ceiling with plants and all the furniture is second hand.” The room, which cost just £ to create, also features an incredible floral themed hand-painted mural by Emma, costing a further £. Outside the quaint cottage is surrounded by fields, with a large driveway and garden, that wraps around the cottage “giving sunshine all day”. Emma said: “My outside space is very big and a wonderful canvas for some future plans. It’s taken me about a year to get to where I’ve got with my home. “I’m a single mum and work full time so it can be hard to achieve the work I do on my home quickly, I dip into it as and when I can.” The mum credits her “creative thinking” for being able to carry out the renovation on such a small budget. Emma said: “My budget has definitely always been on a shoestring so I often have to be creative in my thinking and I source practically everything second hand. “My style is definitely always evolving and I do love change, I’d describe my style as boho with a vintage twist. “I love to style flowers in with my interiors and this features a lot throughout my home, and my colour palette consists of uplting feminine colours that are definitely good for the soul.”Breakdown:Kitchen - £ second-hand furniture and paint for the muralLounge - £ second-hand furniture, paint.

Dr Angelique Coetzee says she was first alerted to the possibility of a new iant when patients at her Pretoria private practice had Covid symptoms that did not make sense. They included young people from a range of dferent backgrounds all with intense fatigue and a six-year-old child with a high pulse rate. None of them suffered from a loss of taste or smell, both symptoms which are heavily associated with apostraditionalapos Covid. “Their symptoms were so dferent and so mild from those I had treated before,” said Dr Coetzee, a GP for  years who also chairs South Africa’s Medical Association.  On November , when four family members all tested positive for Covid with complete exhaustion, she informed the country’s vaccine advisory committee. She said in total about two dozen of her patients have tested positive Covid with symptoms of Omicron - which the world is now scrambling to contain with ious travel bans. They were mostly healthy men who turned up “feeling so tired and about half of them had not even had a single dose - a prevalent issue in South Africa and in swathes of the African continent.  South African scientists say Omicron is behind a sharp rise of cases in the country’s Gauteng province. In the UK, the government has slapped several southern Africa countries on the red travel list - although small numbers of cases have been reported across Europe. There are two confirmed omicron cases in the UK.All international arrivals will have to take a PCR test by the end of their second day in the UK, Boris Johnson announced yesterday evening as he prepared to reimpose measures to control the spread of coronavirus over fears the new strain could evade existing vaccines. The Prime Minister said the temporary and precautionary measures will be reviewed in three weeks, while the Governmentaposs vaccine experts will be tasked with considering whether to extend booster jabs to all over-s.Health Secretary Sajid Javid will be questioned on the details of the restrictions, including on when exactly they will be introduced, during broadcast interviews on Sunday.Mr Johnson announced the strengthening of Englandaposs rules at a Downing Street press conference, after two cases of Omicron were identied, in Nottingham and Brentwood, Essex, with both linked to travel to southern Africa.

It initially took us away from the lakeside but it kept our dog safe from the toxic algae which we were concerned may still be present in the water. Our kids tend to vanish when we enter a wood, their laughter telling us they are playing somewhere close by but out of sight. Such was the case on this day as we meandered up the hill, exploring and admiring the views.A roe deer suddenly bolted from the undergrowth in front of us, taking us all by surprise. It must have been watching us approach, standing still and unseen in the nearby undergrowth. I wonderedwersquod have seen it at allit hadnrsquot decided to run away.Although it was late November, the tree canopy still had a patchwork of autumn colour. The colours were made more vivid when the sun began to set, casting a stream of golden rays through the wood, and for a moment making the lake sparkle. Such moments canrsquot be planned, just enjoyed and appreciated when they happen.Then we heard wild screams from the younger kids. ldquoFaery apples! was the cry. Tiny apples, the size of cherries, carpeted the ground. They had never seen such small apples and came running holding handfuls of them, wonderingthey could eat them.I explained they were crab apples, fallen from the crab apple tree which grew all twisty near the path.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot eat them raw, I explained, ldquobut you can cook them and make crab apple jelly. The moment I said that, I knew Irsquod given myself a task. ldquoCan we make it tonight  was the predictable reply.I will be honest, I have never made crab apple jelly but there is a first time for everything and so we gathered a pile of the tiny apples.We spent more than three hours exploring the wood, finally reaching the end of the lake after many detours and explorations. We took a lower path back to the car, but my we and I noticed something the kids didnrsquot: the sun was below the horizon and it would soon be dark. We hadnrsquot paid much attention to the time but the sun had given us some warning earlier on as it spread its final rays through the wood.We didnrsquot say anything lest the kids got spooked, but we tried to discreetly speed our step so we would reach the car park before it got completely dark. It wasnrsquot easy, as the kids played in the fallen leaves and explored side paths.Finally they noticed. ldquoItrsquos getting dark, one said.ldquoNo, it is dark! replied another.Indeed it was, although we could still see where we were going. The trees now had a dferent guise: dark silhouettes making eerie shapes in the imagination.Then it happened.The moon appeared in the cloudless sky, a nearly full moon, initially reddish in colour, then bright. It was a primeval experience, the lsquobeaver moonrsquo in the sky, lighting our way through an ancient wood. Our son did his best to spook his sisters with tales of werewolves but that just set off a crescendo of imitated wolf howling from them all. It certainly made them all feel much braver in the dark, moonlit wood.When we finally reached the car, I had a tinge of melancholy that we were leaving. But I was glad we had dallied and not noticed the sun disappearing. During our journey in the darkness, we could see the sky through the thinned tree branches in ways we cannot from home. The darkness played tricks on us but the wood felt enchanted most likely it really is.And that bright moon you might have seen it too. I will never tire of admiring its wonder."},{"url":null,"title":"world-cup-draw-channel-time-watch-play-off-draw-today","story":"Scotland isseeded for the semi finals of the play-offs, thanks to an impressive win over Denmark in their final Group F match.Steve Clarkes side joins Wales, Italy,Portugal,Russia and Sweden in the seeded spots, with these teams set to face one ofAustria, North Macedonia, Turkey, Poland, Ukraine or Czech Republic.With the play-offs scheduled for March , this afternoons draw will give us an idea of whats to come for the Scotland team as they try to move one step closer to World Cup qualication.Heres what you need to know about this afternoons World Cup play offdraw, including time and how to watch...The World Cup play offdraw will take place in Zurich, Switzerland at the Fa headquarterson Friday November  at pm UK time.The World Cup play off draw can be livestreamed on Fas official websitethisafternoon.Coverage will start at pm.The World Cup play offs are set to take place in March .The twelve teams in the draw will be ided into three groups to play semis and finals.Semi final matches will be played on March - , and finals on March - .The three winners of these finals will then qualy for the World Cup.Scotland, Portugal, Italy, Russia, Sweden and Wales are all seeded for the World Cup play offs.Scotland and the other seeded sides could be drawn against any of the following teams:The  World Cup will start on November  , with the final taking place on December  .This is later in the year than usual due to extremely high temperatures in Doha in the summer."},{"url":null,"title":"storm-arwen-a1-east-lothian-close-entirety-afternoon-due-extremely-strong-winds","story":"The Met Office has issued its most serious red take action warning covering the period between pm today and am tomorrow , as it warns of a potential danger to le due to extremely strong winds.: Met Office warns of danger to le in East Lothian after issuing its most serious red warningThe A is now closed in both directions between Abbotsview Junction, Haddington, and Thistly Cross Roundabout, near West Barns.##UPDATE##:#AThe #A is now##CLOSED##to ALL vehicles between Haddington and Thistly Cross r about due to strong winds.A clearly signed ersion is in operation to use the #A instead@SETrunkRoads @RHANews @LogisticsUKNews pic OZFACBeDBEAR Scotland, Transport Scotlands operating company responsible for the A, had earlier said thatthe winds were as strong as forecast, it would bring in a full closure of the A in all affected areas.A ersion route is in place via the A.

While a reference in the Latin version to ldquoRegem angelorum, meaning lsquoking of the angels, may instead be an anti-Hanoverian message of opposition to King George II.Dr Bradley says there is a string of indicators to suggest there is more to the carol than a celebration of the infant Jesus.ldquoThe early manuscript mentions lsquoour King Jamesrsquo in Latin, which appears to be a reference to the Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, son of James VII.ldquoAnd there are Stuart cyphers and thistle decorations.ldquoWade was a plain-chant scribe who had gone to France almost as an exile, where he copied manuscripts and taught Latin. As you might expect from an English Catholic college in exile, they did not have much time for Hanoverians.The song was sung only in Roman Catholic places of worship for decades, while carols ndash even those which praised Jesus and celebrated his birth ndash were shunned where.ldquoThey were very much seen as rather vulgar and populist and did not come into the Church of England until  and in Scotland until the end of the th century, he adds.ldquoInstead, they were sung outside in the street, outside pubs and homes where the church did not have so much control.St Francis of Assisi ndash regarded as lsquothe Father of Christmas Carols ndash is said to have inspired the birth of the Christmas carol in the th century after he created nativity scenes in a cave and invited people to sing and worship around a manger.But while Franciscan friars brought songs praising the Christmas story from Italy, churches preferred hymns based strictly on the scriptures, and viewed carols as having Pagan connections, associated with fertility rituals.ldquoWhen we look at the earliest use of the word lsquocarolrsquo in English language in the s, it seems to be a round dance with singing associated with fertility, and no religious signicance, Prof. Bradley adds.ldquoFranciscan friars were bringing songs to the people here, they picked them up and would sing in streets, homes and pubs, but not in church.As carols became more popular, their role for delivering hidden messages grew, he adds.ldquoThe Twelve Days of Christmas was possibly a Catholic song used to teach Catholic doctrine - the five gold rings are the five sacraments of the Catholic Church.ldquoThis was possibly post-Reformation, and the song used to teach tenets of Catholic faith when they were forbidden to practise their faith.While another, Angels from the Realms of Glory, is believed to contain subversive messages from its author, James Montgomery, a Scots-born political radical who had been twice imprisoned for his support of the French Revolution and reform riots in Britain.ldquoThe original last verse talked about justice repelling the sentence of those who had been in prison and mercy breaking the chains, adds Dr Bradley.Perhaps more in the spirit of Christmas, It Came Upon the Midnight Clear contains a message of peace and a call for an end to stre, written by Edmund Sears, a minister in Massachusetts with strong liberal views who wanted peace and social reform.ldquoHe wrote it after there had been particularly bloody revolutions in Europe and a costly war between the United States and Mexico, and it contains the words lsquoO hush the noise, ye men of stre, and hear the angels singrsquo, adds Dr Bradley.ldquoItrsquos a fairly universal sentiment but tempered by his own political instinct.Prof. Bradley will reveal the secrets behind Christmas carols during a talk next Fridayat Scotlandrsquos first religious literary festival, organised by the School of Divinity at the University of Edinburgh.The festival, part of celebrations to mark the th anniversary of New College, the home of the School of Divinity, features a programme of  events, including an exploration of the relationship between religion and crime writing in a presentation by crime author Val McDermid.Best-selling author Robert Harris will discuss portrayals of power, religion and politics in his work, including Fatherland, Enigma and the Cicero trilogy.Acclaimed author Charles Foster and broadcaster Sally Magnusson will also take part, while actor, comedian and writer, Miles Jupp will explore the complex connections between religion, comedy and literature.The festival runs between December -.

Members managed to elect a new committee and secure time to be able to carry out a structural report for repairs to the clubhouse. Had they been unable to elect a committee the lease would have been lost with the site reverting back to arms- council organisation City Property.Former Scotland and Queens Park player Joseph TaylorIn  Mr Brown, who was then with Hampden Bowling Club, discovered a railway map proving Hampden Bowling Clubrsquos legendary tale and this year digs were carried out in a bid for hard evidence. And with  months to go before the th anniversary of the first international, Mr Brown believes now is the time for Scotlandrsquos contribution to football to be recognised and the site of the first Hampden being protected.Read more:Scotlands first national football ground faces uncertain futureMr Brown leads what has become known as The Hampden Collection and Footballrsquos Square Mile - the Worldrsquos Biggest lsquoOpen Airrsquo football museum in Glasgow which follows the discovery of the foundation stone of the Worldrsquos first enclosed purposefully built international football ground.Mr Brown, who will bring together a  of guests for the event, said: ldquoThe next stage of the footballing journey is to get the entire st Hampden Site recognised as the epicentre of World Football. However, to do that, and to bring the story to le, we have brought in a number of other sites that have huge signicance in the story of football, and as launched earlier this year, created the worldrsquos biggest open air football museum.ldquoIn our opinion, this is the way to stamp Scotlandrsquos claim, and also brings huge amount of opportunity to tell this story. Footballrsquos Square Mile is the way to do it and the campaign to make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site will be launched this week which will be one year to go until the th anniversary of the worlds first international football match.Joseph Taylors great grandson Colin discovered the grave in Cathcart CemeteryMr Brown realises it will be a dficult process, but says they are ready for the campaign.ldquoWith the timing and signicant dates next year, along with the possibility that Scotland could be playing at the World Cup, we want to put the spotlight on just how important the discovery of the first Hampden and Footballrsquos Square Mile is. If this was anywhere  in the world that could lay claim to the beginning of football as we know it, it would be a world tourist attraction so why not here.Carrying out a geophysical survey, as well as excavating six trenches in the Queens Park Recreation Ground and Kingsley Gardens site, the archaeologists revealed evidence of the foundations of the first Hampden Park pavilion where the first players to play for Queens Park and Scotland would have got changed before matches and where the team officials would have sat.One of the sites on the Hampden walking tourThey also found tantalising evidence of the original playing surface, sealed beneath over a century of earth and grass, as well as numerous artefacts dropped by the early supporters including beer bottles, juice bottles and clay pipes.Dr Paul Murtagh, Senior Project Officer at Archaeology Scotland who managed the st Hampden Dig Team, said the project was unique in more ways than one as it brought people together.Dr Murtagh said: ldquoThis was a project which was part of Archaeology Scotlandrsquos New Audience Project, funded by Historic Environment Scotland, and brought people from dferent backgrounds and nationalities together. Football was the hook for this and while it not be their own countryrsquos heritage they were helping to establish part footballing heritage.ldquoWe were very lucky to have records to got on but it was when we dug the trenches and with the use of geophysics we could really pinpoint the site. The findings, which included artefacts from people who would have stood on the terraces, really give you something tangible from that moment in time.A group enjoying the Hampden tourGlasgow Football Tour founder Lindsay Hamilton had been aware of the myth surrounding the site of the first Hampden Park, but like many people didnrsquot think much more of it.It was only when Mr Brown approached her to consider working on a Hampden walking tour that she found out more.ldquoIrsquove been offering tours around Glasgowrsquos five main stadiums for many years and I love telling people about our footballing heritage, said Ms Hamilton. ldquoBefore covid I had been taking tourists from all over the world to Hampden Park, Ibrox Stadium, Celtic Park, Cathkin Park and Firhill as well as part of a -minute minibus tour.ldquoGraeme was on my first tour and I remember him saying to me do you want to help me save Hampden Bowling Club and I wondered what he was talking about, but it was the rumour that it was the site of the first Hampden which Graeme then went on to find the map from the National Records of Scotland which showed where it would have been.Due to covid restrictions Ms Hamiltonrsquos minibus tours of the football grounds couldnrsquot go ahead, so a walking tour of the Hampden sites was developed.ldquoThe idea came about for the walking tour bringing in the three Hampden sites and was a chance to be able to tell the story of and signicance of the beginning of world football and the game we know today, Ms Hamilton added.ldquoPeople were keen to get outdoors and embraced walking more during lockdown and we ran nine walking tours this year. When you tell people about the history behind the first Hampden Park they are in disbelief. I think people on the tour, who were all Scottish as we still didnrsquot have international visitors at the time, felt very proud and we want people to go on tell the story and pass it on. The first Hampden needs to be protected and should be celebrated as the site where the modern game watched by billions around the world began.One football fan who joined the tour had a particular interest in Scotlandrsquos football heritage as he is very much part of it.Colin Taylor, the great grandson of Joseph Taylor, was drawn to the tour on his first trip to Glasgow to investigate his football history.ldquoI was always told as a youngster that Joseph Taylor played football for Queens Park, Colin said. ldquoLater I was told he also played for Scotland, but kind of took that with a pinch of salt. When my father passed away in  I started to get interested in family history and with my fatherrsquos brother, my paternal uncle, who was by then in his mid s, started looking through old photos and we found one of Joseph and one of his grave. My uncle said he had looked for Josephrsquos grave in the rsquos but assumed it was in Langside and thought it had been lost during bombing in the Second World War.Ten yearsrsquo ago Colin discovered the location of Taylorrsquos grave by accident.Colin added: ldquoIt was a simple email to Cathcart, I emailed every cemetery in Glasgow, and I discovered where he rested. I was also contacted by the historian Andy Mitchell who sent me more information on Joseph and a photo of his grave.ldquoI saw an opportunity this year after lockdown to go to Scotland for a few days and visit Josephrsquos grave and visit Hampden. I was intrigued by the three Hampdenrsquos story and the discovery of the very first Hampden.ldquoI joined a walking tour in September and I achieved my ambition of seeing Josephrsquos grave, seeing the original Hampden where he played, and Queenrsquos Park where he also played and practised.I could feel goosebumps looking at the old pavilion at the bowling club and imagining Joseph not only playing there but also being instrumental in some major decisions as he was president of Queens Park for a year after he finished playing in ."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-oliver-brands-omicron-variant-restrictions-manipulation-mass-hypnosis","story":"Scotland followed and is aligning with the new border restrictions being imposed by the UK Government.In a rant on GB News, the Renfrewshire-born presenter said to viewers: \"Here we go again.\"With Christmas on the horizon, a holiday that should be a time for families to put the past behind them and look towards the future, a new iant of the virus has seemingly been dispatched from poor old Africa as the gt no one asked for and no one wants.\"After months of messages of fear from our governments and their favoured scientists, here comes more of the same.

In Scotland that most obviously applies to the constitutional issue.But political partiescan manufacture ision, too.The prime example is Brexit, achieved through the referendum but which was won by a combination of egregious departures from the truth and dark money, which employed Cambridge Analytica to target voters through a huge and well-funded Facebook disinformation campaign.Then there is the predominantly Tory press, and its online presence, which mobilised voters through inflammatory rhetoric such as the infamous decrying of judges as ldquoenemies of the people.Other political parties, and their voters, are entitled to hold the perpetrators at armrsquosand more.Further, the Conservative-led coalition of - claimed ldquowe are all in this together in its response to the financial crisis, a patent untruth as austerity, by design, affected those on the lowest incomes most.Austerity was also economically counter-productive but achieved the ideological aim of shrinking the state, which in turn led to a lack of preparation for a pandemic by ignoring the recommendations of Exercise Cygnus, a cross-government exercise in  to test the countryrsquos response to a serious influenza pandemic, long before Covid struck.The Conservatives have been an uncompromisingly ideological party since  and have driven the UK rightward based on a minority of the vote backed up by dark donor money and willing media propagandists.If our politics are broken, as Mr Mackay says, it is largely because of an ideological unwillingness of Conservatives to compromise on the biggest issues and to play by their own rules.

The majority of Scots will wholeheartedly agree ndash but education is not the only failure for Ms Sturgeon.There has been failure after failure, far too many to list here, all apparently forgotten about during Covid.Ms Goring needs to remember that in virtually every election in Scotland since , local and Holyrood, pro-Union votes outnumber pro-separatist votes and, come another referendum, given current statistics, the same will apply.Nicola Sturgeon is fully aware of this, hence her desire to deny supporters a vote and maintain her lucrative tenure for as long as possible.

And in an effort to address poverty, all Scottish government employees are paid the living wage.I applaud Mr Kellyrsquos call but we have to appreciate what has already been done in an effort to tackle the scourge of poverty, and recognise that only % of all welfare spend in Scotland is devolved. So perhaps he would add his support to a call for full welfare powers to be devolved to Scotland with immediate effect,we are to truly tackle poverty.Catriona C Clark, Banknock, Falkirk.AN ASSERTION OUT OF THIS WORLDWHILE I agree on the urgency for worldwide measures to combat global warming I am astonished that the SNP deputy leader, Keith Brown, has suggested in his speech to the partyrsquos annual conference that the lsquofuture of our planetrsquo depends on Scottish independence .Which planet would that be  The one with the Big Rock Candy Mountain, cigarette trees, soda fountain, milk and honey etc  Certainly not the one which I share with . billion others, many of whom have never heard of Scotland, and to whom Scotlandrsquos independence is irrelevant.R Russell Smith, Largs.LEADERS MUST NOT WORRY IN PUBLICCHRIS Whitty, Englandrsquos chief medical officer, should stop worrying.The government hesitated over restrictions twice, at great cost, needlessly worried in the first case whether people would accept a lockdown at all and, in the second, over Christmas restrictions.The job of leaders is not to worry in public. It is to get on and lead, above all to save lives.The economy is their great concern yet the great driver of mankind for many centuries has been the pursuit of profit and power.It is in the nature of business to adapt to circumstance.Felicity Graham, Perth.THE QUEENrsquoS LIFELONG SERVICETHE poor old Queen need not look to Joanna Blythmanfor sympathy, or regret, when the time comes.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

In those circumstances, we would ask friends, family and neighbours to keep an eye on people who may be experiencing problems as a result – and dial  to report any power issues. “We would ask that people ensure that anything that could be blown about is safely stowed away or tied down – strips of plastic or polythene, for instance, can cause power cutsthey get wrapped around power lines.”Weather and transport updates are available on the OIC Updates Facebook page and on the @OrkneyCouncil and @OrkneyPolice Twitter feeds.Readyscotland.org has a list of tips to stay safe including:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was thought the inidual visited the wider borough and not Parliament. vw,vw,px, px\"Senior health official Dr Jenny Harries has said it is lsquovery likelyrsquo more Omicoron cases will be found in the UK this week The first two infections were identied in Nottingham and Essex, where officials were ordering PCR tests for customers of a KFC in Brentwood as far back as November .Dr Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, acknowledged it was ldquovery likely that further cases of Omicron would be discovered in the coming days.But Health Secretary Sajid Javid told families they should plan for a ldquogreat Christmas ldquoas normal and insisted it was ldquonowhere near time to reintroduce social distancing rules and work-from-home guidance.It was hoped the new measures would buy time for scientists to gain greater understanding of Omicron as ministers put the NHS on notice to deliver many more vaccines every day.JCVI deputy chairman Professor Anthony Harnden said extending the age range for boosters and reducing the gap between second and third doses was ldquoa sensible strategy.He told BBC Radio rsquos Broadcasting House that adults aged  to  should expect third jabs to be offered to them ldquoearlier than we had previously envisaged.New measures are being introduced as a precaution to slow down the spread of the #OmicronVariant of #COVID:##Face coverings in shops  on public transport##PCR tests for international arrivals##Self-isolation for contacts of suspected Omicron casesMore info #mdash Department of Health and Social CareNovember , The group was also considering whether second doses should be offered to - to -year-olds.Whitehall sources were hopeful the decision may come on Monday, but could not rule out Tuesday for the JCVIrsquos announcement.Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi recommended that staff, visitors and pupils in Year  and above should wear masks in communal areas in schools, colleges and universities such as corridors, canteens and halls in England from Monday.Though the reintroduction of masks in England in shops and public transport will bring the nation back closer into line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the face coverings are not being required in pubs and restaurants.Mr Javid said it ldquowould be irresponsible to make guarantees during the ever-changing pandemic, but he told Skyrsquos Trevor Phillips on Sunday: ldquoI think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas, I think itrsquos going to be a great Christmas.With the Government stopping short of introducing its plan B to tackle Covid- this winter, Mr Javid played down any need to reintroduce social distancing rules or work-from-home guidance.He warned of the ldquovery heavy price of additional restrictions, adding: ldquoSo,one was to make decisions like that they would have to be done very, very carefully and wersquore not there yet, wersquore nowhere near that.Passengers arriving in the UK from am on Tuesday will be required to take a PCR test by the end of their second day from entry and isolate until they receive a negative test, while  southern African nations have been added to the red list.Mr Javid admitted that passengers flying in from southern Africa before  nations were added to the red list were not tested on landing and they could have taken public transport to get home.ldquoI think the speed at which we acted could not have been any faster, he told The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC, adding that those arrivals had been contacted and told to take tests.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the bulk of the ldquotemporary and precautionary measures on Saturday, pledging that they would be reviewed in three weeks.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On average, the supply of listings at the end of January runs some % higher than the start of December.ldquoBuyer demand will remain strong moving into next year, but as the market starts to normalise in , there may be an increase in the proportion of activity among movers, who are active in the market as sellers as well as buyers. This should ease the constraint in supply to some extent.ldquoOther factors that will affect prices next year include the looming economic headwinds in the shape of rising inflation ndash which will push household costs higher.ldquoEven with some interest-rate rises,mortgage rates are likely to remain relatively low compared to long-run averages, and there is more room for price growth across some of the most affordable housing markets.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

They join South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini already on the list.It is understood there are three main areas of concern for Stormont’s health officialsthe new iant is problematic: the effectiveness of the vaccine, the clinical impact on the region’s already pressurised hospitals and its transmissibility.Almost three million vaccinations have been administered to the public here in the form of first, second and in some cases third vaccines or boosters. More than , people were tested for the disease in the past week.It is hoped such readiness will help in the fight against the latest iant.However, Northern Ireland still has the highest infection rate in the UK or Ireland and the lowest vaccination rate, though the numbers of people in hospital with the virus are decreasing slowly.Mid Ulster Mid and East Antrim Antrim and Newtownabbey and Causeway Coast and Glens have had notably high infection rates of above  cases per , population.There was some optimism yesterday when a scientist behind the Oxford vaccination spoke favourably that the existing vaccines will be effective against Omicron and that it is “extremely unlikely” that it will cause a “reboot” of the pandemic — a sentiment echoed by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar.Professor Andrew Pollard, who helped create the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, said experts would need to wait “several weeks” for confirmation but said existing jabs could still be effective at presenting serious illness.As well as the UK, several cases of the iant have been identied in Belgium, Germany, the Czech republic, Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel.More than  people who arrived in the Netherlands on two flights from South Africa on Friday tested positive for Covid. Dutch authorities are trying to establish whether the passengers have the new iant.The World Health Organisation has said the iant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection.Read MoreNetherlands confirms  Omicron cases as travel curbs tightened across the worldOmicron iant spreads to more countries as world on alertIsrael tightens travel restrictions over new Covid iantHowever, little is known about it, specically whether it will escape vaccines.In the Republic, scientists have begun analysing data taken from samples dating to the start of November at its Backweston facility for markers of the new iant.Yesterday, Cillian De Gascún, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said he hopes to have preliminary data tomorrow on whether the new iant has been detected in Ireland.Dr De Gascún said he was concerned about the new iant, but that it was too early to tell how prevalent it could become. He said there was no evidence yet that it would evade vaccines or cause more severe disease.However, he added, information emerging from South Africa suggests it is even more transmissible.Mr Martin said the new restrictions coupled with the booster vaccine campaign will ensure “intergenerational engagement that will happen around Christmas time will be less hazardous for the vulnerable”.However, the Ombudsman for Children Dr Niall Muldoon said he expects the Government to have “robust plans” to protect access to school, education support and social interaction.“We are approaching the third calendar year of this pandemic and there are still challenging times ahead,” he said.Meanwhile, the new Covid certication scheme here in Northern Ireland will not be mandatory in unlicensed premises “at this stage”, the Department of Health has said.Under the policy, which will be introduced in draft form tomorrow, people wishing to gain entry to designated venues will need to demonstrate evidence of Covid- vaccination, a negative lateral flow test result or proof of infection in the previous six months.But such a scheme would require Assembly approval.Most ReadMichelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingA forever family home in south Belfast’s Upper Malone RoadDerry Girls star Jamie-Lee: ‘I got asked out all the time... by women’Mandatory PCR tests and self-isolation for all arrivals in Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland is most dangerous place in Europe for womenTop VideosPlayBoris Johnson announces tightening of coronavirus rules after new iant reaches UKPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolateLatest CoronavirusCaroline Curran: ‘I feel part of me is missing since Julie died… but I know she’d be proud of my new comedy show’Lindy McDowellOpinionThe Covidiots who gurn about losing their liberty curtail it for the rest of usStormont ministers attend events despite their work from home messageNI cricketers may have to quarantine onfrom ZimbabweViewpointOpinionWhat is it we want from the elected LatestTeenage boy to face court over murder of -year-old Ava WhiteVaccine experts expected to give advice on expanding boosters to all adultsCharles to highlight UK bonds as Barbados becomes a republicTeenager charged with murder of -year-old Ava WhiteTottenham fans who travelled from Dallas for postponed game get Harry Kane offer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was also an apt description of the dark and heavy rain clouds hanging over Belfast city centre on Friday.Retailers would have been hoping for a constant ringing of tills, but the miserable weather — with storm Arwen bringing gales, downpours and even hailstones — clearly had put people off from hitting the shops and had them logging online instead. Read MoreBargain hunters reign in the rain as NI shoppers get that Black Friday feelingEven the popular Christmas market at Belfast City Hall appeared to be lighter on festive cheer.Although footfall appeared to be fairly brisk, lots of people were zigzagging across the main throughfares minus shopping bags — a sight that would disappoint store owners.And of those who were carrying bags, it was the familiar Primark logo that was a frequent occurrence, despite the retailer being one of a handful of big high street names, along with BM and Next, to shun the event.Zara appeared to be a popular choice, with the Royal Avenue store buzzing with fashion fans snapping up items with discounts of %.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sports fashion retailer JD Sports also appeared to be enticing in customers with what it had billed was its ‘biggest ever Black Friday’.Keen to take advantage of the bargains was Kilkeel man Brendan McVeigh who took the opportunity of Black Friday to make an overnight stay in Belfast.Laden with shopping bags displaying brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Mac and TKMaxx, the -year-old said the breadth of deals was not as evident this year.“The likes of Jack Wills would have had % off and it’s not happening this year.

I didn’t come in for Black Friday especially, I just happened to be in the town.”Picking up the best deals wasn’t the number one priority, with the biting, blustery winds focusing Francine’s mind where.“I’m off to get a nice warm cup of tea,” she laughed.Nearby, friends Victoria Smith and Rebecca Thomas had hit the ground running with their hands full of shopping bag and one particular store had them parting with their hard-earned money.“There were some great discounts on their gt sets and things like that,” said Victoria.Rebecca added: “It’s been a pretty good Black Friday.”Belfast retailers, many of whom have been financially hit hard by the impact of lockdown restrictions, will have their fingers crossed they can say the same when they come to tally up the takings.  Most ReadMichelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingA forever family home in south Belfast’s Upper Malone RoadDerry Girls star Jamie-Lee: ‘I got asked out all the time... by women’Mandatory PCR tests and self-isolation for all arrivals in Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland is most dangerous place in Europe for womenTop VideosPlayBoris Johnson announces tightening of coronavirus rules after new iant reaches UKPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolateLatest Northern IrelandOrange Order: ‘Tens of thousands’ sign anti-protocol declarationCaroline Curran: ‘I feel part of me is missing since Julie died… but I know she’d be proud of my new comedy show’Northern Ireland set for very mixed week of weather after being battered by Storm ArwenWork under way to identy any spread of Omicron in Northern Ireland – SwannIrish cricket team on way home after red list troublesLatestTeenage boy to face court over murder of -year-old Ava WhiteVaccine experts expected to give advice on expanding boosters to all adultsCharles to highlight UK bonds as Barbados becomes a republicTeenager charged with murder of -year-old Ava WhiteTottenham fans who travelled from Dallas for postponed game get Harry Kane offer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We’re going to see a frost tonight [Sunday] so there will be a cold start to the day, particularly across Antrim, Down and Armagh — the eastern side of the province.“Cloud will increase and will largely melt the frost by the end of the night. There will be a few spots of rain as well, particularly up towards the north coast.“It will be milder on Monday with milder air coming in from the Atlantic. We will see temperatures around eight or nine degrees so it will feel considerably less cold.”Colder conditions willon Wednesday, with strong, blustery winds and frequent heavy showers expected, while Thursday looks set to be the sunniest day of the week.“A really topsy turvy week to come,” added Mr Morgan. “Temperatures are all over the place, changeable spells of weather, some rain in all areas but at this stage nothing will be too impactful or severe.”Meanwhile, Met Éireann#s long-range forecast for Ireland has indicated settled, dry weather with temperatures slightly above normal for Christmas Day.Most ReadMichelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingA forever family home in south Belfast’s Upper Malone RoadDerry Girls star Jamie-Lee: ‘I got asked out all the time... by women’Mandatory PCR tests and self-isolation for all arrivals in Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland is most dangerous place in Europe for womenTop VideosPlayBoris Johnson announces tightening of coronavirus rules after new iant reaches UKPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolateLatest Northern IrelandOrange Order: ‘Tens of thousands’ sign anti-protocol declarationCaroline Curran: ‘I feel part of me is missing since Julie died… but I know she’d be proud of my new comedy show’Work under way to identy any spread of Omicron in Northern Ireland – SwannIrish cricket team on way home after red list troublesAnti-vaccine passport messaging in NI shopping centres ‘very concerning’LatestTeenage boy to face court over murder of -year-old Ava WhiteVaccine experts expected to give advice on expanding boosters to all adultsCharles to highlight UK bonds as Barbados becomes a republicTeenager charged with murder of -year-old Ava WhiteTottenham fans who travelled from Dallas for postponed game get Harry Kane offer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His father, who died suddenly in March , competed in triathlons for Ireland and was a member of the North West Triathlon Club. Dannyhas now raised over pound, for mental health and wellbeing organisations across the city. Over his -day challenge, people from across the city and district joined him for sections of his challenge, with others lining routes to cheer him on. Danny thanked the people of Derry saying they “lted him up, and filled him with adrenaline.” He said: “Thank you all so much, from the bottom of my heart, from the sweat on my brow to the blisters on my feet, thank you. And of course, to my daddy, I hope I made you proud big man. Danny spent much of the year training for thechallenge starting on August , which consisted of a. mileswim, followed by a milecycle and then a milemarathon, every day for  consecutive days. At a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council on Thursday, a motion proposed by Sinn Feacuteins Christopher Jackson and Sandra Duffy, calling for the honour to be bestowed on Mr Quigley, passed unanimously. Councillor Jackson said: “The challenge itself caught the imagination of the city and the most important element of it is the promotion of positive mental health. Danny has raised over pound, for local mental health charities and he has created a lasting legacy. This motion is a way ofacknowledgingDanny, his family and all the supporters that helped him complete this task. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane and DUP Councillor Graham Warke said Danny has brought a city together and said it was something that was very much needed” during such a dficult time. “I’ve never seen anyone  do that,” he said, “The money and awareness he has raised, he is a credit to everybody and to his family.” Sandra Duffy added: “The work that he has done and the awareness he has raised has been absolutely tremendous.“We have a really ordinary citizen who has done an extraordinary thing.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Reporter: Staff Reporter Nov   addthis, Local author Jane Buckley recently published the second of her four novels,Darkness,following the release of Stones Corner, Turmoilearlier this year. googletag.cmd.push The novels tell about the everyday realities of le in Derry and beyond from the early dark days of the Troubles in the s through to the Good Friday Peace Agreement in April . Jane said: When I look back at the launch of Stones Corner,Turmoilin February, I cant believe since then Ive completed a second novel,Darkness, and Im now working on the third,Light. Having begun to research the early s, Ill admit its been tough to find positive storylines. Ive also found it challenging, at times, to remain objective. For example, not only did I have to dig deep for good news stories, but events such as the HMS Maze hunger strikes along with the Troubles continuing to rage on was dficult. Thankfully, I came across some encouraging tales, and Ive developed them into progressive storylines. Jane said the global reception and fantastic reviews she has received for Turmoil and Darkness have been overwhelming. She added: “Readers from as far as New Zealand, the USA, Canada and even Denmark have remarked on how much theyve enjoyed the thrilling clf-hanging endings.  “Although one US reader was particularly upset when she got to the end of Turmoil without realising it was the first in a tetralogy. She was about to award me a four-star review until she got to the last chapter of Turmoil and instead sent me an email venting her frustration! I quickly contacted her and, thankfully, explained all, so much so, she gave me a five-star rating for Darkness. When Jane first completed Stones Corner, Turmoilduring lockdown, it began as a one-off project, a single novel but now its evolved into a series of four books or more formally known as a Tetralogy, a term for her which she admits she had to look up in a dictionary when one of her readers referred to it! Janes ambition was to educate the younger generation on le during the Troubles. However, she’s discovered that demo- graphically, most of her readers are women aged  upwards many of whom have remarked that through the descriptions of people and places in the books, theyve found themselves taken back in time and can closely identy with it. Marketing and promoting the novels has been a new experience for Jane. She explained: Marketing Stones Corner, Turmoil and Darkness, has been a whole new experience Ive learned so much in such a short time, some good, some bad!  “There are so many books published every year in the UK, circ.,, and an average authors sale per book is around . “Thankfully, my sales have exceeded that in just a matter of months, and with fingers and toes crossed, sales will increase over time as word of the books spread.  “Given Im an indie author, I must think out of the box when attracting readers – a continual challenge. Why would readers want to buy my book - a mere unknown  Yet they do, so I must be doing something right! Reviews are crucial to and it’s a fine line in nagging readers to leave them, but they’re critical for success. Local support for my work has proven invaluable readers are now recommending the books and knowing that they’re being read and discussed out there is satisfying beyond belief. Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol has added impetus to Janes desire to remind and encourage people to remember and learn everyday le during the Troubles.  I think its more important than ever that we dont allow the ugly head of sectarianism to rise again and threaten us with the horrors of another conflict and struggle. The Good Friday Agreement is still on thin ice and must be treated with care and common sense and clear thinking. You cant tell me theres anyone in this amazing country of ours would want to face conflict again  It would be a catastrophe for all of us. Jane has also received support from local authors, and in the process of introducing her work, investigated the opportunity of holding a Walled City Literature Festival in the city.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Nov   addthis, Local author Jane Buckley recently published the second of her four novels,Darkness,following the release of Stones Corner, Turmoilearlier this year. googletag.cmd.push The novels tell about the everyday realities of le in Derry and beyond from the early dark days of the Troubles in the s through to the Good Friday Peace Agreement in April . Jane said: When I look back at the launch of Stones Corner,Turmoilin February, I cant believe since then Ive completed a second novel,Darkness, and Im now working on the third,Light. Having begun to research the early s, Ill admit its been tough to find positive storylines. Ive also found it challenging, at times, to remain objective. For example, not only did I have to dig deep for good news stories, but events such as the HMS Maze hunger strikes along with the Troubles continuing to rage on was dficult. Thankfully, I came across some encouraging tales, and Ive developed them into progressive storylines. Jane said the global reception and fantastic reviews she has received for Turmoil and Darkness have been overwhelming. She added: “Readers from as far as New Zealand, the USA, Canada and even Denmark have remarked on how much theyve enjoyed the thrilling clf-hanging endings.  “Although one US reader was particularly upset when she got to the end of Turmoil without realising it was the first in a tetralogy. She was about to award me a four-star review until she got to the last chapter of Turmoil and instead sent me an email venting her frustration! I quickly contacted her and, thankfully, explained all, so much so, she gave me a five-star rating for Darkness. When Jane first completed Stones Corner, Turmoilduring lockdown, it began as a one-off project, a single novel but now its evolved into a series of four books or more formally known as a Tetralogy, a term for her which she admits she had to look up in a dictionary when one of her readers referred to it! Janes ambition was to educate the younger generation on le during the Troubles. However, she’s discovered that demo- graphically, most of her readers are women aged  upwards many of whom have remarked that through the descriptions of people and places in the books, theyve found themselves taken back in time and can closely identy with it. Marketing and promoting the novels has been a new experience for Jane. She explained: Marketing Stones Corner, Turmoil and Darkness, has been a whole new experience Ive learned so much in such a short time, some good, some bad!  “There are so many books published every year in the UK, circ.,, and an average authors sale per book is around . “Thankfully, my sales have exceeded that in just a matter of months, and with fingers and toes crossed, sales will increase over time as word of the books spread.  “Given Im an indie author, I must think out of the box when attracting readers – a continual challenge. Why would readers want to buy my book - a mere unknown  Yet they do, so I must be doing something right! Reviews are crucial to and it’s a fine line in nagging readers to leave them, but they’re critical for success. Local support for my work has proven invaluable readers are now recommending the books and knowing that they’re being read and discussed out there is satisfying beyond belief. Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol has added impetus to Janes desire to remind and encourage people to remember and learn everyday le during the Troubles.  I think its more important than ever that we dont allow the ugly head of sectarianism to rise again and threaten us with the horrors of another conflict and struggle. The Good Friday Agreement is still on thin ice and must be treated with care and common sense and clear thinking. You cant tell me theres anyone in this amazing country of ours would want to face conflict again  It would be a catastrophe for all of us. Jane has also received support from local authors, and in the process of introducing her work, investigated the opportunity of holding a Walled City Literature Festival in the city. She said: I was stunned at the amount and quality of Northern Irish based writers but couldnt see a local literature  for us to share and show off our work. As such, I spent a great deal of time putting a plan together for a three-day Derry-based festival over a weekend. Sadly, it didnt take happen because of a lack of funding.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The same goes for age and stage, for example, just because a jigsaw says  pieces and age from three years it does not mean your three year will be able to do it especiallythey’ve never done a jigsaw before. Remember, too, it’s all well and good saying he’ll be able to do it in the summer, that’s six months away,he can’t nearly do it now, and won’t be able to with a bit of help don’t buy it or there’ll be tears, snotters and grumps from you both. Personal  Social -doll and teddy to cuddle, feed, dance and play with or even just look cute sitting on the bed! Role Play Toys -such as tea set, pram, brush, hoover, kitchen to make dinner - or dinner for dolly! Imaginative Play -cars   fire engine   digger, train with track or a garage for cars -it’s got a ramp even better. Or Peppa Pig swing and slide, farm, Noah’s ark, bus with people to go on! Happy Land offer a great range in early imaginative play toys. Or traditional dolls house, rockets, play mobile sets etc. Animals -farm animals - maybe use pretend grass for the field. Animal figures to name, to later match baby to mum or add to imaginative play. Themed animals for older children - boys and bugs, girls and sea animals. Bricks And Block -mega blocks or wooden bricks to build and knock down and later to sort colours and shapes, or make into buildings and tunnels. Of course, there’s lego, meccano and magnetic building toys too. Puzzles -peg puzzles,  Cause And Effect Toys -for younger children, to press buttons, push levers left and right, turn handles for noise   lights   new sights, wooden hammer bench or a press and spin toy. Or maybe noisy toys, xylophone, drum and of course an old favourite the laser zapper that makes that awful noise.  Push and Pull toys -dog on a rope, rainbow wheel, duck with a handle - defo for those just walking. Outside -sit-on scooter, sit in car, balance bike, bubble fish, pull and play wagon or slide. Balls, to kick, throw, learn to catch or throw through a basket ball hoop. For older children hula hoop, roller skates or Space Hoppers!!! Special Place -tent with cushions, maybe a garden house or even just fairy lights and voile to go around her bed  Craft -chunky crayons and paintbrushes, finger paint, maybe try water colour paints for your budding artist, or an easel. Playdough sets, jewellery making, aeroplane building, wooden car making - what does your child like  Bath Time -ducks or boats to float, dolly to bath, smelly bath bubbles, or even a packet of jelly bath!  And to finish, the rhyme I say every year, buy me … and remember … Something I want, something I need, something to wear, something to read. Something so I can play a game with you, something that helps me learn too. Something to help my imagination grow, something creative to make or sew Something for inside, something for out and maybe a surprise I can tell my friends about! Everything doesn’t have to have batteries or be plugged in, Technology is great in small amounts, but it’s time to play with you that counts. So this Christmas time buy what I like and need, don’t go mad and buy up the shop, Think of the things we can do together,because its time to talk, sing, read and play, Which builds my future every day!

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mr Martin says the Government will have to keep its options open on further restrictions, explaining: NPHET have put in a caveat also that further measures can not be ruled out...can be very honest about that. His warning has been echoed by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, who said that it is impossible to saythere could be a lockdown in the future.

Other measures that are due to be introduced by the govt include: People will be told to work from home, under recommendation from NPHETVaccine passes will be required to access theatres and cinemas but not at hairdressers, barbers or gymsStrict rules around mask wearing for indoor and outdoor settings.  In addition to the new rules, two other measures aimed at reducing transmission of the virus were also revealed.

However, with confidence ing as vaccination rates rise, and economies gradually open back up, people are on the hunt again. He commented, “Recruitment is becoming an employee’s market, and the volume of roles available gives workers more options, allowing them to select the business with the best offering. Furthermore, after  months of working from their own homes, many people don’t want to go back to the office full-time.” Some % of respondents to a survey of around , Irish employees by the University of Limerick’s Kemmy Business School said they agreed or strongly agreed that ‘my future career lies outside of this organisation’. This was regardless of whether they worked in multinationals, indigenous Irish companies, SMEs or the public sector. The survey found that % of managers, % of site leaders, % of regional leaders and % of global leaders based in Ireland also feel their future lies outside of their current organisation. Mr Kindlon said businesses that fail to prioritise employee wellbeing, professional development and company culture could see employees leave in their droves in search of an employer that better meets their needs – and struggle to recruit new talent to the business. “It’s crucial that businesses focus on becoming an employer of choice in order to sustain operations and accelerate growth as economies recover from the disruption of the pandemic.” While competitive pay and generous perks are key to employee satisfaction and retention, he said flexibility and the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the job is just as important. “Multiple studies have shown that, more than ever, traditional office-based workers want a better work-le balance. That means flexible, remote or hybrid working to allow them to manage their professional and personal responsibilities in a way that benefits both their wellbeing and productivity.” “It means offering tangible, valuable employee benefits that put employee wellbeing at the forefront – so less of the ping pong tables, more of the competitive pension contributions and annual leave allowances. And it means nurturing a more positive company culture, in which the right to disconnect is respected – and so are employees.” He said the true impact of the great resignation remains to be seen, but employers who take the possibility of mass resignations and stled recruitment lightly will surely bear the brunt of this once-in-a-generation phenomenon as we move into . “Losing employees can be very costly. If multiple employees leave within a short time frame, depending on your company size you could be hit with huge costs as well as stled growth while you backfill positions.” There are a number of ways that companies can retain and engage current employees. These include offering a competitive mix of employee benefits with tangible value – such as enhanced pension payments, health insurance, above-statutory annual leave allowances, and flexible working to support employees’ work-le balance and wellbeing. Offering routes for career progression, either through promotion opportunities or by enabling employees to move to a dferent area of the business where desired and appropriate are also options. Mr Kindlon said the great resignation is both a threat and an opportunity for businesses in a wide range of industries. “While some businesses could see employees leave due to a number of contributing factors, employers with a competitive offering could see an increase in the talent available to bring into their teams.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It’s a fairly cringeworthy experience watching so many people pretend to like each other and dance and act like they’re not in it for the next round. The reason I get so worked up about it is that I was watching musicians for years and years, before the Arts Council handed out cheques, just making great music. Some of them still do. Jeanette Hutton still does. I’ll end up sounding like a lick but it’s a small price to pay to get across her importance to music here. The easiest way to explain her is that she’s the real thing. An incredible vocalist that you’ve undoubtedly heardyou were ever out on a Saturday night in Derry. A gted songwriter that has changed yet again for her third record. An irreplaceable friend and all-round cool girl with the best taste in music you’re going to find. A genuinely fine human being.She once told me that hearing Let There Be Rock by AC DC on Tommy Vance’s rock show inspired her to pursue music and to join Philby, who toured with Mama’s Boys and played with Rory Gallagher. Philby gained a local following which got bigger and bigger and that eventually meant they could buy a transit van and move to London . But the dficulties of constant touring around a circuit that covered a lot of distance around England with little to no pay to, even worse, pay-to-play gigs caught up with them and the band parted ways. Not that this was a bad experience and the band had gained enough acclaim to get write ups in Kerrang magazine and gigs in the famous Marquee venue in London . After a year out back home, Jeanette got involved in a local jam session with Frankie Robinson and Mickey the Hat and that has developed into her becoming one of the most recognised and respected musicians in the town. This led to her band Lady J’S first album with husband Ruairi O’Doherty, bassist David Doherty and guitarist Marty McGill and produced the self-titled album and some of the best gigs the parish has seen. Like I said earlier, this lady, J, has the best taste in music you’ve ever heard, and she took an absolute swerve in her next project with her sister Noella. Blood, the album and the live experience was all things to all music fans, loud and acoustic, heavy, and sweet, lyrical, and melodic set against loud guitars, quiet guitars and familial vocal harmonies that can only be captured by relatives. The perfect storm and another chapter in the book of big Hutton. Now we’re at the next chapter, the one where it’s just Jeanette. “Melancholy Me” is described a collection of dark, reflective, and weighty tunes that showcases her as a more introspective writer with brooding stories to tell. I’ve always found her music to be like that, the delivery is ever changing in a way that a great musician seems to be able to do that without taking a wrinkle out of them but the over-arching substance that fills her songs is a constant. There are a lot of musician and listeners out there who have a lot to learn from Lady J Hutton. Keep up to date with all happenings Hutton on her Facebook page, Jeanette Hutton Music. She’ll also be supporting Damien Dempsey in the Millennium Forum on Saturday th January and tickets can be got for that herewww.millenniumforum shows damien-dempsey . Remember something, the best music is right on your doorstep, it isn’t on Facebook, it doesn’t matter about likes on social medial or Spoty numbers, you can’t listen to music on computer, and it will never feel as good as seeing a band live and you can do just thatyou follow this yellow brick roadhttps:nervecentre.ticketsolve shows . You’ll see me at Jeanette’s gig on Sunday in the Nerve Centre, where I should point out her Blood co-conspirator and actual blood relative, sister Noella Hutton will also be playing and feel free to ask why I ended this like the Sopranos mid-  Magee on Music: Bloody Sunday . . .  years on  Special programme of events to mark th anniversary    Magee on Music: Still The Happiest Man in the World  Kevin Magee chats with local artist John Breslin    Magee on Music: New hope withof Stendhal Festival  Music festival at Stendhal -

Dermot Kennedy  Michael Moloney performed a Dermot Kennedy song on the Toy Show last year and was surprised by Dermot Kennedy mid-song during his performance. Michael was very professional and continued singing despite the shock and surprise sketched on his face. It was a truly heartwarming moment that uplted the viewers as we battled our second lockdown last year.  Davy Fitz: One of the most iconic moments in Toy Show history, Michael won the hearts of the nation when he appeared on the Toy Show. He revealed his favourite GAA manager was Davy Fitz and joked that he did not think they would get along as he was from six-mile bridge. Dvy Fitz walked out and surprised Michael, who was bewildered by his appearance. He asked Mr. Fitz to sign his book as he had brought it along with him . Davy invited Michael to speak to the Wexford team before their league matches.  While many celebrities drop by to say hello to Ryan and the children, family members also make an appearance. These are sure to warm your heart, and no doubt tonight will add to the list. Nanny Pat  Tom stole the show in  when he was surprised by his Nanny Pat on set of the Toy Show. He previously said he liked to knit with his Nanny Pat and she gave the best hugs. The two embraced with a warm hug and smiles all around. A very heartwarming moment in .  Graham Burke  Adam and Kayla Burke from Midleton, Co Cork were reunited with their dad Sergeant Graham Burke in a heartwarming reunion. Adam and Kayla unwrapped a giant present where their Dad was hiding, both children had tears of joy when he emerged. Graham ed from Mali where he has been completing his th tour of duty peacekeeping overseas.  John Doyle the Porter  Ireland was introduced to the lovely Adam King last year, and the nation was besotted with him. During his segment on the Toy Show, Adams favourite hospital porter surprised him on set and Adam gave him a virtual hug. John said Adam brings the best out of everyone he meets and he had the brightest smile.  Alex from Austraila  Lee and his family were surprised by their big sister Alex who came home from Australia for Christmas. Alex was not supposed to come home for Christmas, but Ryan and co. brought her home for Christmas to surprise the entire family. It was an emotional reunion as Lee had not seen his sister in three years and embraced her in a big hug.  Many more memorable appearances have occurred throughout the history of the Late Late Toy Show, and tonight will be no dferent. The list continues to grow with every show, and itreally is the most wonderful time of the year.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Written by Johnny Gogan and Brian Leyden and directed by Gogan, the film was produced by Dromahair-based Bandit Films. The film was scored by Sligo’s Glenn Garrett, edited by Dromahair-based Patrick O’Rourke and shot by Strandhill videographer Peter Martin. Black Ice tells the story of Alicewho is drawn into the clandestine boy - and girl - racing scene where Jimmyis considered top dog among the petrol heads in a fictional Donegal border community. Their relationship and their attempts to get into the legitimate rallying scene are undermined by forces at work in this shadowy border world threatening their ambition, the town where they live and, ultimately, Alice’s family. Black Ice received a wide release in Ireland in  and was one of the best Irish performers at the box office and on DVD that year. The film received repeat broadcasts on RTEacute. The film’s release on Netflix follows the recent release of Johnny Gogan’s feature documentary Hubert Butler Witness to the Future on the streaming service. The film will now be available - in multiple languages - across Netflix’ European network Johnny Gogan s to Donegal for the commencement of his new novel Station to Station. The pacy thriller about a rogue Irish diplomat commences and revisits at ious points in the narrative, Donegal’s Lough Derg pilgrimage island. Station to Station which featured at the recent Allingham Festival is centred around the uncovering of the corruption around a rather unique Irish-Spanish property deal on the south coast of Spain. Published by Lepus Print, the book is available through independent book shops in Donegal and nationally. Johnny Gogan’s other feature drama work includes The Bargain Shop , The Last Bus Home , Mapmakerand the drama-documentary Prisoners of the Moon . The release of his feature documentary Groundswell earlier this year was welcomed by ’s Chief Film Critic Peter Bradshaw as “a lesson to communities there and everywhere  to stay vigilant”.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Killian Scott and Jane McGrath in Black IceWhats OnNetflix release for Donegal-set feature film Black Ice overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24Novemeber2021_StreetBoost.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

It calls you to be salt and light about what you believe in, she said.ldquoIt does annoy me when people say you have to take religion out of politics and leave it at the doorhelliplike it only happens at the weekend. It is part of who you are.ldquoYour Christianity and your faith is something that is with you all the time. You canrsquot just leave it at home on Sunday night and go out without it on Monday.Mrs Foster said she does not hold grudges against those who had hurt her, including former colleague Edwin Poots, who ousted her from the DUP leadership in May before being forced out of office himself just weeks later.Reflecting on the decision by Sinn Fein to collapse the executive with the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in , she said: ldquoWe got into a spiral and we couldnrsquot stop it and it got to a point then where the assembly collapsed and of course I regret that it was down for three years.She said she liked the late DUP leader Ian Paisley very much. ldquoHe used to joke with me and say, lsquoHow are the Anglicans doing Arlenersquo Asked by Mr Kellyshe thought Dr Paisley had mellowed over the years, she said: ldquoI never knew Dr Paisley personally until   and I think he probably was in a dferent space than he had been in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties.She declined to speculate on what might have changed him. ldquoI donrsquot know. I canrsquot answer that. I only know he was very supportive of me as a female and an Anglican and as an outsider. He asked me to be in the administration in  which I have always been very thankful for.Mrs Foster said her Christian faith helped her to seek common ground with people she did not agree with, adding that her reason forgoing into government with Sinn Fein was to make sure that her children and others did not endure what she went through as a child.This included the attempted murder in  on her father, John, an RUC reservist, living on the Fermanagh border, and a bomb attack on her school bus driver in which her friend was left severely injured.Recalling the gun attack on her father, when she was around eight years old, she said he came crawling back from the barn, after gunshots were fired, with blood dripping from his forehead.ldquoIt was a very strange time, she said. ldquoMy mother was sitting at the kitchen table and I donrsquot know what she was doing but I will never forget her face. She just froze.Ms Foster said it was not politically correct to say it, but she felt she benefited from being educated at an all-girl school, where she grew in confidence.The former political leader said she was enjoying her new role in journalism as a presenter on GB news - but said more must be done to tackle the hurtful abuse on social media particularly against women.Mrs Foster was welcomed by Dr Tim Campbell, director of the St Patrick Centre, who said her personal story was incredibly interesting.He remarked: ldquoArlene Foster was extremely gracious and gave very generously of her time and people in the audience responded to her warmth..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24November2021_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  November 28%2C 2001  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Angry traders in Downpatrick have this week called for tougher action to be taken against teenagers terrorising local businesses.They are demanding that the townrsquos police commanders are provided with additional resources to take the problem and that the courts hand out much stfer sentences.Their call comes amid mounting concern about the behaviour of an umber of juveniles who are verbally abusing and intimidating female staff in shops throughout the town and stealing from businesses.Traders say they are becoming increasingly frustrated that no punitive action is taken against the teenagers when they appear before the courts and that the sentences handed out to them are too light.The current position is so serious that number of shop owners are locking their doors during opening hours and admitting customers only after a visual check.One local trader, who did not want to be named, said the teenagers responsible for the trouble were being allowed to intimidate the business community and suggested an exclusion order should be placed on them, banning them from the town.ldquoThese people have no fear and no shame and walk about the town asthey owned the place.

Once people leave the bars they then head over to the takeaways where they hang out until around .am.ldquoEveryone is usually very drunk and I believe this is leading to a lot of the sectarian trouble in the town. It is completely unfair to any residents living close by who are trying to sleep and are kept awake by drunk people hanging around the streets, he said.SEAFORDE mdash A mother of five feels she has no choice to to move house following plans to erect a telecommunications mast at Seaforde.Siobhan Devlin recently moved into her home at Dunnanew Road and was horried to discover that a number of mobile telephone companies are planning to extend an existing mast close to her house to accommodate  new antennae.She is so concerned about the effects the mast could boast to her childrenrsquos health she is seriously considering selling her newly build dream house.Accusing mobile phone companies of being completely undemocratic by putting masts up against the wishes of the local community, she said she cannot understand why a decision was taken to extend a mast so close to a large number of houses.The Seaforde community is overwhelmingly behind Siobhan and a group of parents, concerned for the health of their children, have written a letter to planners demanding the development is stopped.She said: ldquoEveryone is completely shocked that such a major proposal has ben put to planners so close to our homes. A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The southern team was trying to reach the world cup finals while the Ulstermen wanted to give their manager, Billy Bingham, a fitting send offThe southern team was trying to reach the finals of the tournament in the United States, while the Ulstermen wanted to give their legendary manager, Billy Bingham, a fitting send off as he retired from international football.I was there and the atmosphere was competitive, on and off the pitch. When Northern Ireland’s striker, Jimmy Quinn, sent a volley arcing past Pat Bonner’s outstretched glove in the second half, Windsor Park erupted with joy.The theme song that night, ‘There’s only one team in Ireland,’ had already been firmly established.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The chant had been heard first in Dublin, when the Republic’s fans taunted northerners during a - win. That mockery hurt, because Northern Ireland was traditionally the dominant force in Irish football, qualying for international tournaments while the south struggled. Now that Northern Ireland had taken the lead against Jack Charlton’s side the song was redeployed. The stands at Windsor Park shook with noise, as the Green and White Army reminded their rivals that theirs was the original Irish football team veterans of three World Cups and reigning Home Nations champions.Billy Bingham, the Northern Ireland manager, was retiring from international footballUnfortunately, minutes later, the Republic equalised and secured their place in the US. I still maintain that goal came from a free-kick that should not have been given. Nigel Worthington shoulder-charged Eddie McGoldrick perfectly fairly, but the referee decided otherwise.These are the decisive moments that haunt fans, but they are part of the game and the Republic was deservedly destined for New York. The saddest thing was that Bingham did not get the winning end that his career deserved. However, his team had restored a lot of pride with its battling performance. Of course, Northern Ireland was a troubled place in November . The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist attacks like the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel massacre. Northern Ireland fans at the November  game at Windsor Park. The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist massacres yet the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinisterDespite this deeply unpromising context, the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinister. I was only a teenager, but I had already seen more vitriol at club games and I would do so many more times in the years to come. That’s why I was delighted to read Mark Rainey’s two page spread, in Wednesday’sNews Letter , about the myth that Windsor Park was a cockpit of hatred that night. He explained in detail how the hood got started. The Republic’s manager, Jack Charlton, believed that Northern Ireland should have gone easy on his team. Famously, after the final whistle, he said, “Theybattled too hard... They will get no favours from us... ever.”This typically graceless comment set in train a series of inventions, distortions and exaggerations that were repeated asthey were gospel by generations of players, fans and commentators.As Mark noted rightly, none of these accusations were levelled at the home fans in the immediate aftermath of the match.Many of the modern preconceptions about Northern Ireland fans’ conduct seem to have arisen from the Marie Jones’ play, A Night in November. Soon these details were cited by pundits who were nowhere near Windsor Park, but who nevertheless portrayed it as a bastion of bigotry.The contrast between what I saw that evening and the hysteria that followed made a strong impression on me, even as a schoolboy. It showed me vividly thata myth was repeated often enough in Northern Ireland it became accepted as fact, not just by its nationalist inventors, but by neutrals and well-meaning unionists too. Even Northern Ireland’s advocates now tell a story about how fans transforming their behaviour after this supposed “night of hate”. This narrative highlights the way the atmosphere at Windsor Park changed over many decades, becoming more inclusive and family friendly, but it repeats a caricature that was never fair or real.Football fans have rarely behaved perfectly. They are passionate, get carried away and sometimes act aggressively and badly. No doubt, some Republic fans found the atmosphere at Windsor Park in  unpleasant or uncomfortable. They were not, it must be said, supposed to be in the stadium in the first place.The myth of the “night in November” has been perpetuated for so long that it is now unlikely ever to be dispelled. Thank goodness that a journalist has the courage to challenge it and explain its origins. It will mean a lot to very many people.

That is also the message of today’s gospel narrative. Even in the midst of the world’s confusion and chaos, Jesus reassures us: “The Kingdom of God is near”. As dficult as it may sometimes be to discern its presence. Our Lord faced turbulent times as well – born of parents forced to seek shelter for the night in a cow shed – not exactly the palace of a prince or king. Yet, the surprise of Christ’s incarnation forces us to look again in our own age at the “signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars”, and to consider anew the signs of God’s involvement in the world about us.Advent is the season when we learn to overcome our “fear and foreboding” and once more open our hearts to others just as God has disclosed and demonstrated his love for us in Christ.Advent also reminds us that our spiritual winter will come to an end. The fig tree will again blossom and bloom. “Summer is near,” our Lord reassures us – even at the beginning of Advent. “Our redemption is drawing near.”Amid all the dficulties of this le, when uncertainty and fear loom near, may we ever look to Jesus, and put all our faith and trust in Him, mindful that His word and promise to His people “will not pass away”.Let us remember His timely warning: “Be on your guard”. We must always recall that, as the Gospel reminds us, our Lord will come like a thief in the night, and at a time when we least expect him. As we enter the Advent season, may we be vigilant, awake, and always on our guard for Christ’s ‘Second Coming’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

That’s the appeal to the public from Health Minister Robin Swann, as public health measures are activated in response to the Omicron iant’s emergence. Mr Swann also underlined the continuing importance of vaccination in the battle against all strains of the virus. “Subject to the Speaker’s approval, I intend to update the Assembly on Monday in regard to the measures being deployed in response to the emergence of the Omicron iant,” the Minister said. “These include the addition of a number of countries to Northern Ireland’s Red List for international travel. “The emerging picture on the Omicron iant is being very closely monitored and we will continue to liaise with public health colleagues in the other UK jurisdictions and the Irish Republic.” The Minister urged everyone to adhere to the basic steps that will help stop the spread of all iants of COVID-. These include: getting vaccinated and getting your booster dose when eligible, wearing a face covering, limiting contacts, keeping rooms well-ventilated or meeting outdoors when possible, working from homepossible, and practising good hand hygiene. If you have symptoms of COVID- – a high temperature OR a new, continuous cough OR a loss of or change in sense of smell, or taste, no matter how mild – please isolate and get a PCR test as soon as possible. The Health Minister continued: “There are concerns that the Omicron iant may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines. That is not confirmed and it is important to emphasise that. “Furthermore, eventhis does turn out to be the case, it remains vital that as many people as possible get their first and second doses and their booster vaccines when eligible. “I have been assured that our vaccines should still provide a level of protection against Omicron. The importance of that cannot be overestimated. Secondly, we know that our vaccines are very effective against the Delta iant. Delta very much remains the predominant iant in NI at the current time, is a very real and present risk to our population, and is continuing to cause serious illness and, in some tragic cases, death to our fellow citizens.” Mr Swann continued: “Plans have been activated to identy any spread of the new iant in NI. “Using passenger locator data, the Public Health Agency is identying and contacting iniduals who have recently arrived in Northern Ireland from Red List countries. “They and their household members will be asked to self-isolate and undertake PCR tests. If any positive cases are detected, the sample will then undergo Whole Genome Sequencingto determine the iant type. If the new iant is confirmed here, all appropriate health protection actions will be carried out and the public will be informed as appropriate.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbbccfef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_faeedfaef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
