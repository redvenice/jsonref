Another 20,000 jobs in the supply chain were put at risk by the collapse of the talks between the Government and British Steel’s owner, private equity firm Greybull.Unions cautiously welcomed the announcement. But defence experts raised concerns over the apparent ties between Oyak – whose chairman is former army general Mehmet Tas – and President Recep Erdogan’s government in Turkey. The country’s defence minister and head of armed forces attended Oyak’s annual general meeting in May, the Financial Times reported.         The deal with Oyak is expected to be signed in two months once the company\u0027s finances are checked. (Pictured: Oyak\u0027s logo)         The military pension fund also owns steelworks in Turkey and is believed to have offered around £70million for the business in a deal that could save almost 4,000 jobs. (Pictured: Red hot steel being rolled out at British Steel\u0027s Scunthorpe plant, Lincolnshire, in 2016)Turkey remains an ally through Nato but it has cosied up to Russia in recent years, forging defence ties over Syria.Dr Julian Lewis, defence committee chairman, said: ‘No industry with a strong defence dimension should pass out of the control of British firms and jurisdiction.‘Turkey was once a strong and reliable Nato ally, as far as Russia is concerned, and a Muslim country that separated religion from politics. What’s particularly concerning is that neither of those things is true today.‘While the proposed deal is better than seeing the industry collapse completely, it is much less desirable than having the company under British control.’Oyak has also been accused of corruption by a parliamentary commission in its home country.Dr Andrew Foxall, of think-tank, the Henry Jackson Society, said: ‘Recep Erdogan has set the country on a course toward authoritarianism in recent years.‘Flirting with Russia and China while oppressing its people, Turkey is increasingly turning its back on the West.‘Given that British Steel is crucial to our national infrastructure, the Government should consider extra steps to safeguard it under Turkish ownership.’         British Steel was put into compulsory liquidation in May after rescue talks with the Government broke down. (Pictured: The British Steel plant in Scunthorpe in 2008, where 3,000 people are currently employed)         Turkey remains an ally through Nato but it has cosied up to Russia in recent years, forging defence ties over Syria.(Pictured: British Steel logo at the Scunthorpe plant in 2019)Steel is considered a strategic industry, because companies like British Steel provide materials to build warships and railways.Oyak, which will purchase the plants through subsidiary Ataer Holdings, offered around £70million in line with other bidders including Liberty Steel, which rescued mills in Wales, Yorkshire and Scotland in 2017.Roy Rickhuss, of union Community, said: ‘This is an important milestone, and will be hugely encouraging to the workforce.‘We will want to be assured that Ataer has a long-term strategy to invest in the assets and develop the business.’Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said: ‘This is an important and positive step forward in securing the future of British Steel. I am committed to a modern and sustainable future for the industry that is productive and supports a skilled and highly valued workforce.’Oyak said it is run by independent managers, does not receive contributions from the Turkish government and adheres to strict corporate governance principles.  RUTH SUNDERLAND: My family of steelworkers built the world. How they would loathe this sell-off Commentary by Ruth SunderlandSteel is not just another industry, not to me. It’s in my soul, my blood, my DNA. Generations of men in my family worked in the blast furnaces on Teesside, including my late father and my maternal granddad.So when I say I feel for the people of Scunthorpe, a steel town just like my own, it runs deep.I know that there are thousands of families who have lived through months of agonising fear since British Steel went into receivership in May. There are some in Teesside too, where it still has around 700 staff, the remnant of an operation that once sustained an entire region.Believe me, then, when I say I understand the relief, even jubilation at the news that the Turkish army pension scheme has offered to buy the business and save those jobs. But I’m genuinely sorry to say that the deal fills me with a deep sense of unease and foreboding.         Steel is not just another industry, not to me. It’s in my soul, my blood, my DNA, writes Ruth Sunderland. (Pictured: A view of British Steel\u0027s plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, in 2019)         Generations of men in my family worked in the blast furnaces on Teesside, including my late father and my maternal granddad, writes Ruth Sunderland. (Pictured: The British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, pictured in 2019)My fear is that a Turkish takeover will prove yet another chapter of despair for the gallant steelmen who have endured so much. The army is, of course, closely tied to President Erdogan, Turkey’s authoritarian leader, who has recently been holding talks over arms deals with Russian president Vladimir Putin.Why does the Turkish military, via its pension scheme, want to get its hands on our steel? Is it just an investment, or is another agenda in play?And why, given we have our own pension funds controlling trillions of pounds of assets, can’t it be sold to one of our own?Perhaps potential British buyers are influenced by the pervasive myth that steel in this country is dying and not worth propping up. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite all the woes inflicted in the past four decades, our manufacturers produce 8million tonnes of high-quality steel a year. The industry employs 32,000 people directly and more than 52,000 on top of that in the supply chain.Of course, the sector is much smaller than in the past. As recently as the early-Seventies, it employed more than 300,000 people, my dad and granddad among them.The sad reality is we have allowed it to wither away through a combination of short-sighted government policies and shoddy ownership, not through inherent problems with the workforce or the product. The Scunthorpe steelworks has been passed like a parcel from one unsatisfactory owner to another and there is nothing about the proposed Turkish takeover to suggest this shameful record has changed.         So when I say I feel for the people of Scunthorpe, a steel town just like my own, it runs deep, writes Ruth Sunderland. (Pictured: British Steel\u0027s Scunthorpe plant in 2015)Most recently it was owned by Greybull Capital, a company founded and run by a group of super-rich private equity barons. They took it over for a token £1 in 2016, revived the old British Steel brand name and promised to restore its fortunes. This spring, just three years later, the Official Receiver was called in. Before that, it was owned by Indian conglomerate Tata.Steel-making is by its nature a cyclical business and there are times when it needs a helping hand, yet successive UK governments have failed to offer one.Instead, they have pursued policies that put our industry at a grave disadvantage.Plants are subjected to heavy business rates and they are forced to pay 51 per cent more for the electricity they use than German producers and 110 per cent more than French steelmakers. The uncertainty over Brexit has not helped. If there is No Deal, much of our steel exports could be subjected to big tariffs.Yet demand is rising around the world and could be filled by UK producers. Steel is needed to make virtually everything from wind turbines to trains, buildings, cars and coins. It is also, of course, key to our defence industry.Surely this gives pause for thought that a Turkish army retirement fund, run by a former general, is being hailed as a saviour?If British Steel is sold off, at the very least the UK government should insist on keeping a golden share and a seat on the board so we have some control.There are things the Government can do now even now to save our steel. Boris Johnson has said he wants to kick-start infrastructure projects.He should set a priority on buying British steel for all of them. Only 43 per cent of the steel procured by the UK government is sourced domestically at present.My father was made redundant from the steelworks in the 1980s. It broke his heart, and it makes me sad and angry even now, but it is a consolation that the steel he and other Teessiders made is everywhere from the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Churchill’s War Rooms in Whitehall.When I took my niece there a couple of years ago, my heart thumped in my chest when I pointed out the manufacturer’s name on the girders, a marker of her heritage and mine.Yes, I am emotional about this, but there are hard facts to support my belief that steel in this country not only has a great past but could also have a great future. Will it be achieved through this Turkish deal? Sadly, I doubt it."},{"url":null,"title":"BBC pits young against old plan 100m ad campaign woo younger viewers","story":"Share this article Among all adults in the UK, 78 per cent watch the BBC weekly.Due to the dwindling viewership among young people, traditional advertising hosted for free on the BBC\u0027s platforms will not reach the target market.The tender document says: \u0027New digital behaviours, particularly for younger audiences, mean that it is becoming increasingly challenging to reach young audiences solely through promotion on our owned media channels.\u0027 The £25million-per-year contract will be spread over four years and the BBC is currently searching for a media agency to run it.

New York’s politan Museum of Art described her objects as seeming “simultaneously familiar and novel”. Born in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1950, she trained in Farnham, Surrey (where she now lives), then at the Royal College of Art. Her approach grew from a formative period when she returned to Africa to learn about local ceramic practice. Magdalene Odundo: The Journey of Things, featuring 50 of her works alongside 100 contemporary and historic pieces from all over the world, chosen by the artist, is at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich, until 15 December.You “hand-build” rather than using a wheel – can you explain the technique?Each work originates with a ball of clay which is gradually hollowed out and pulled upwards to create the walls of the pot. Short lengths of coil are added to build height. As each piece rises, it is sculpted inidually to create the distinctive silhouettes. Unlike throwing on a wheel, where the piece of clay is worked mechanically and shaped by relatively stable hands, I am the one moving around the work, or moving a turntable to shape each aspect of the form.Your pieces are based on the human form – why?Using the human form is a very natural way of sculpting with clay. After all, the Bible says that God took clay and used it to form man. It’s something that is within our culture. The first thing you do as a child is get a piece of clay, squeeze it into your hand, add bits and pieces, then draw an eye or a mouth on to it. Clay automatically lends itself to making. It is embodied into the motion of making a body, a person.Ceramics are often described as “craft”. Do you think this is a helpful definition?For me, crafting work is a term that means you are making work, you are actually crafting a piece of work. There is nothing wrong in making craft I actually think it’s a very apt word for making, but it’s not helpful when it classifies certain work as not being of equal status to art. When you say you’re a craft person, people just assume that you don’t have the same attributes and the same ability as somebody who is an artist.Do you think the art world takes ceramics seriously?I think it’s beginning to do so. A lot of people from other mediums are now working in clay. This is not surprising, because of all making mediums, clay is the most versatile and pliable and naturally earthly, sympathetic and human. More than any other art, it has crossed the boundaries of disciplines in very interesting ways. You see people like Richard Deacon and Yayoi Kusama using clay. Tony Cragg has used clay for a long time, and his work is very object-oriented. There’s also Sterling Ruby.I can’t actually think of anyone who isn’t excited about clay. I mean, look at Grayson Perry. But I would suggest that if someone is interested in seeing ceramics, they should visit the art school degree shows around the country.• Magdalene Odundo: The Journey of Things is at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich, until 15 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7566b10fded410006a15b9217d98c881fc1720ed/1580_323_3214_1928/master/3214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2aa78834e50453ca218a7b0d698ac5d6","title":"a belarusian womans life story in outfits in pictures","story":"Minsk-based photographer Tatsiana Tkachova was in Volozhin, Belarus in 2017 when she saw an elegant woman in a bright dress.

They speak to the dark politics of our timesBack in the benighted 20th century comic books were seen as subliterate trash for kiddies and intellectually challenged adults – badly written, hastily drawn and execrably printed. Martin Goodman, the founder and publisher of what is now known as Marvel Comics, once told Stan Lee that there was no point in trying to make the stories literate or worry about character development: “Just give them a lot of action and don’t use too many words.” It’s a genuine marvel that this formula led to works that were so resonant and vital.The comic book format can be credited to a printing salesman, Maxwell Gaines, looking for a way to keep newspaper supplement presses rolling in 1933 by reprinting collections of popular newspaper comic strips in a half-tabloid format. As an experiment, he slapped a 10 cents sticker on a handful of the free pamphlets and saw them quickly sell out at a local newsstand. Soon most of the famous funnies were being gathered into comic books by a handful of publishers – and new content was needed at cheap reprint rates. This new material was mostly made up of third-rate imitations of existing newspaper strips, or genre stories echoing adventure, detective, western or jungle pulps. As Marshall McLuhan once pointed out, every medium subsumes the content of the medium that precedes it before it finds its own voice.Enter Jerry Siegel, an aspiring teenage writer, and Joe Shuster, a young would-be artist – both nerdy alienated Jewish misfits many decades before that was remotely cool. They dreamed of the fame, riches and admiring glances from girls that a syndicated strip might bring, and developed their idea of a superhuman alien from a dying planet who would fight for truth, justice and the values of President Roosevelt’s New Deal. Barely out of childhood themselves, the boys’ idea was rejected by the newspaper syndicates as naive, juvenile and unskilled, before Gaines bought their 13 pages of Superman samples for Action Comics at 10 bucks a page – a fee that included all rights to the character. Not only was Siegel and Shuster’s creation the model for the brand new genre that came to define the medium, their lives were the tragic paradigm for creators bilked of the large rewards their creations brought their publishers.It is generally agreed that Superman launched the golden age of comics in June 1938 with his debut in Action Comics #1, published by what is now known as DC Comics. Siegel and Shuster had created a new archetype – or perhaps, more accurately, a new stereotype – and by 1940, once the nascent genre had demonstrated that it could get kids to part with millions of dimes per month, swarms of imitators catapulted hordes of four-colour heroes into the skies, all chasing the gold in this golden age. The juvenile naivety of Superman was, it seems, actually part of its allure, inviting youngsters into a new especially kid-friendly kind of story whose fantasies were even more unfettered by logic than most prose pulp fiction, all presented with diagrammatic visuals in primary and secondary colours that could make every page a theatre curtain to be raised on to new eyeball kicks and … action.Goodman, trend-surfing publisher of some lurid pulps, was one of the first to ride the superhero wave, immediately making a giant splash with his first issue of Marvel Comics in October 1939. (The first printing of 80,000 copies was followed by a reprint of 800,000 more.) The content was provided by Funnies, Inc, a comic book packager that could produce complete comics from concept to finished art for nascent publishers who wanted to keep their overheads low. These “shops” had something in common with the garment district sweatshops that many of the artists’ family members worked in. Usually done as piecework while punching a time clock with many hands (script-writers, pencillers, inkers and letterers) all attacking the original pages almost simultaneously, this was more a small industry than an art form.It recruited green youngsters, washed up old hacks and even – when the second world war came along and drafted many of the young men who filled the growing demand for comics – women, people of colour and other interlopers. (Those interlopers, by the way, still had to provide the racist and sexist stereotypes that have long been a touchstone of the whole medium.)At this point, it might be worth pointing out (not out of ethnic pride, but because it might shed some light on the rawness and the specific themes of the early comics) that the pioneers behind this embryonic medium based in New York were predominantly Jewish and from ethnic minority backgrounds. It wasn’t just Siegel and Shuster, but a whole generation of recent immigrants and their children – those most vulnerable to the ravages of the great depression – who were especially attuned to the rise of virulent antisemitism in Germany. They created the American Übermenschen who fought for a nation that would at least nominally welcome “your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free … ”To namecheck just a few of these secular Jews who had adopted Clark Kent-like secret identities: Gaines was born Max Ginzberg Goodman’s parents immigrated from Vilnius, Lithuania Jack Kirby (né Jacob Kurtzberg), the powerhouse who co-created Captain America with his landsman Joe Simon, was born in the slums of New York’s Lower East Side and Stan Lee, who became the face of Marvel Comics, was Goodman’s wife’s cousin, nepotistically hired as a 17‑year-old office boy named Stanley Lieber. Though not welcome in the higher precincts of advertising and publishing, they were all able to find their niche at the bottom of the barrel.The unseasoned artists in these comics factories discovered the possibilities of a new form while under do-or-die deadline pressures. They picked up their skills by copying each other and by stealing directly from the masters of the newspaper adventure comics: Alex Raymond (Flash Gordon, Secret Agent X-9), Hal Foster (Tarzan, Prince Valiant) and Milton Caniff (Terry and the Pirates). On the other hand, Carl Burgos (né Max Finkelstein), who created the lead feature in Marvel Comics #1, The Human Torch, proudly said: “If they wanted Raymond or Caniff they could look at Raymond or Caniff. The miserable drawing was all mine.” A writer-artist, his then rudimentary drawing skills were buttressed by an intuitive visual storytelling ability and were applied to an inspired character: The Human Torch. The character – an anthropomorphised streak of red and yellow flame – had a graphic intensity that burned its way into readers’ eyeballs and personified the raw crackling energy of the early comic books before they were domesticated.William Blake “Bill” Everett, Burgos’s comrade at Funnies, Inc, was an oddity in comics. For one thing, he wasn’t Jewish. Everett came from a 300-year-old patrician Massachusetts family and he really was a direct descendant of his namesake. He came to the outsider status that drew him to comics via an addictive personality – he was a heavy drinker from the age of 12 and had a three-pack-a-day cigarette habit – or maybe it was an outsider’s sensibility that drove him to drink. He was one of the most gifted artists ever to work in comic books. He drew fluidly, was comfortable in many genres, and had a sense of page design that allowed the reader’s eye to find buried visual treasures while swimming effortlessly through a story.His alienated antihero, Namor, the Sub-Mariner, was the forefather of a long line of troubled characters that would populate the Marvel universe a couple of decades later. In the 1940s the Sub-Mariner was singular – a marked contrast to the square and square-jawed vigilante do-gooders who lived in the less scruffy DC Comics neighbourhood. Never fully at home in the ocean or in the air, Namor was proud, arrogant and more volatile than the Human Torch, his complementary opposite. But water and fire combined to bring Marvel Comics to an elemental boil.In late 1940, over a year before Pearl Harbor, while the Nazis were Blitzkrieging London, Simon, an entrepreneurial freelancer for Funnies, Inc, was hired by Goodman to write, draw and edit for him directly. Simon showed him the cover concept for a new superhero that he and Kirby had dreamed up – a hero dressed like an American flag with giant biceps and abs of steel has just burst into Nazi headquarters and knocked Hitler over with a haymaker to the jaw. Goodman began to tremble, knowing what an impact this book would make and remained anxious until the first issue of Captain America, dated March 1941, landed on the stands. Goodman had been terrified that someone might assassinate Hitler before the comic book came out!Captain America was a recruiting poster, battling against the real Nazi super-villains while Superman was still fighting cheap gunsels, strike breakers, greedy landlords and Lex Luthor – and America was still equivocating about entering the conflict at all. No wonder Simon and Kirby’s comic book became an enormous hit, selling close to a million copies a month throughout the war. But not everyone was a fan in 1941 – according to Simon, the German American Bund and America Firsters bombarded the publisher’s offices with hate mail and obscene phone calls that screamed “Death to the Jews!” Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, a real-life superhero, called to reassure him, saying: “The city of New York will see that no harm comes to you.”Kirby’s hyperkinetic figures with hypertrophied muscles left human anatomy in the dust. His characters were bellicose, humourless, single-minded and angry as they burst out of saw-toothed panels and widescreen spreads. His art set the tone for superheroic action, not just during the war years, but ever since.I know that Kirby was a protean original as a comic book creator as well as a genuine war hero, but I confess that I have a blind spot when it comes to the superhero genre that grew out of the template he set. Even when I was 12, superheroes were my methadone – I was deeply addicted to satire magazines such as Mad, and the old newspaper comics I discovered in my public library’s bound volumes. I preferred more mature fare like Donald Duck and Little Lulu. You see, I love the form of comics – the pages full of co-mixed words and pictures butting up against each other, all those little boxes you have to compare and contrast to pry out the narrative juice and I adore the weird idiosyncrasies of cartoon language in all its accents. Those who find superheroes the alpha and omega of comics date the end of the golden age to some time in the postwar 1940s when interest in the genre faded.Disenchanted GIs, no longer an eager and captive audience, may have realised that it wasn’t Captain America who won the war. Maybe it was the Russians! In any case, demobilised soldiers either grew out of the comic book habit or shifted their attention to other genres. Crime, cowboy, romance, horror and war-themed comics flourished, often with more mature – and even lurid – content designed for older readers.I date the end of the golden age to 1954. A moral panic built on the false assumption that the medium was strictly for young kids and was turning them into juvenile delinquents had led to comic-book burnings and to US Senate hearings that ultimately put many publishers out of business and maimed the rest. Sanitised superheroes brought the medium off life support in 1956 (now hailed as the beginning of the silver age) but the medium never regained the ubiquity it had in its heyday – as comic books. As movies, they have conquered the world!Back in the golden age, if you wanted to see some guy in a cape fly over a skyscraper or turn New York City into rubble, comic book panels were the most satisfying delivery system. In the 21st century, thanks to the miracle of CGI, many millions of people around the globe who have never read a comic or heard of graphic novels go to their multiplexes to worship the new deities that embody the DNA of comics.The young Jewish creators of the first superheroes conjured up mythic – almost god-like – secular saviours to deal with the threatening economic dislocations that surrounded them in the great depression and gave shape to their premonitions of impending global war. Comics allowed readers to escape into fantasy by projecting themselves on to invulnerable heroes.Auschwitz and Hiroshima make more sense as dark comic book cataclysms than as events in our real world. In today’s all too real world, Captain America’s most nefarious villain, the Red Skull, is alive on screen and an Orange Skull haunts America. International fascism again looms large (how quickly we humans forget – study these golden age comics hard, boys and girls!) and the dislocations that have followed the global economic meltdown of 2008 helped bring us to a point where the planet itself seems likely to melt down. Armageddon seems somehow plausible and we’re all turned into helpless children scared of forces grander than we can imagine, looking for respite and answers in superheroes flying across screens in our chapel of dreams.While the content of comic books has hijacked our cinema, the form of comics – cleverly disguised as graphic novels – has infiltrated what’s left of our literary culture. When the Folio Society, venerable publisher of luxurious illustrated books since 1947, decided to plunge in with a deluxe compilation of golden age Marvel comics, they invited me, as a graphic novelist and comic book scholar, to write an introduction to the book. Perhaps they misguidedly figured that I might lend the endeavour a fig leaf of respectability.I turned the essay in at the end of June, substantially the same as what appears here. A regretful Folio Society editor told me that Marvel Comics (evidently the co-publisher of the book) is trying to now stay “apolitical”, and is not allowing its publications to take a political stance. I was asked to alter or remove the sentence that refers to the Red Skull or the intro could not be published. I didn’t think of myself as especially political compared with some of my fellow travellers, but when asked to kill a relatively anodyne reference to an Orange Skull I realised that perhaps it had been irresponsible to be playful about the dire existential threat we now live with, and I withdrew my introduction.A revealing story serendipitously showed up in my news feed this week. I learned that the billionaire chairman and former CEO of Marvel Entertainment, Isaac “Ike” Perlmutter, is a longtime friend of Donald Trump’s, an unofficial and influential adviser and a member of the president’s elite Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. And Perlmutter and his wife have each recently donated $360,000 (the maximum allowed) to the Orange Skull’s “Trump Victory Joint Fundraising Committee” for 2020. I’ve also had to learn, yet again, that everything is political... just like Captain America socking Hitler on the jaw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36b6dd79275a5713b932a3ac10d74626d7df5c1d/0_286_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4df39547e62336afcf2c396be6428fda","title":"book clinic what can i read to look cultured when i go to cambridge","story":"Q: What books should I read before I start university?

Her 2010 novel, Whatever You Love, was shortlisted for the Costa novel award and the Orange prize, while her bestselling novel Apple Tree Yard was adapted by the BBC into a four-part drama starring Emily Watson and Ben Chaplin. Her most recent novel, Platform Seven, tackles suicide, coercive control and life after death.Platform Seven features a dead protagonist. Why did you want to tell a story from the perspective of someone who has died?I grew up in a small town in the East Midlands, so going back home to see my parents has always involved changing trains at Peterborough. It can be a really bleak station on a cold winter’s night, and I used to have a joke that when I die and go to purgatory, I’ll find myself trapped on Peterborough station. So I decided to have a novel with the ghost of a woman who was trapped there: it’s a transitional place. She’s a lost soul.What were the challenges in having a dead protagonist?I was really intrigued by the technical challenge. For a start, you have to work out what your ghost can do. Can my ghost pass through walls? Are they a poltergeist? I decided early on that I wanted her to be able to read people’s minds because as well as her story, I wanted the novel to be an ensemble piece: she is also the omniscient narrator of other people’s lives.One of the central themes in the book is coercive control. What made you want to write about that?I was interested in writing about a relationship where there was no physical abuse but a huge amount of manipulation and psychological abuse, and how that could be just as potent and deadly. And trying to convey the ways in which very ordinary men, who people think of as good blokes, can be abusive in ways that are so subtle and all-pervasive that even the recipient mistrusts her own perceptions of it.What research did you do?I think everybody has been in or come close to a relationship like that, and if you’re lucky you get out early not because you necessarily fully understand what’s going on, you just know something doesn’t feel right. I think that by-and-large women are still raised to mistrust their own instincts if a man presents as eligible.Coercive control was criminalised in 2015, and yet by the end of 2018 the vast majority of cases had been dropped without charge. Why do you think that is?Women who’ve been subjected to it for many years might not seem reliable: they don’t trust themselves, their stories may be inconsistent, they may have mental health problems, which after decades of coercive control is almost inevitable. It’s the same for a lot of crimes against women: the focus is still on the behaviour of the victim. There’s got to be a seismic shift.When did your love of writing begin?Very early on. I was often accused of having an overactive imagination as a child and I was an avid reader. I used to fib to my mum, saying I was going out to play with the other kids and actually having a book in my pocket. I’d built a den on the waste ground at the far end of the housing estate where I grew up and I would hide there and read. I wrote a novel when I was 11 I even cut out cardboard covers because I wanted it to be a hardback. And I spent a lot of time in the local library. It made me into a writer.So you didn’t grow up in a bookish household?Not at all. My dad left school when he was 13, my mum when she was 15 or 16, and my brother and sister and I were the first generation to go to university. My parents were from very working-class backgrounds but my father did have a real bee in his bonnet about education and self-improvement .What were your favourite books as a child?I was into fantasy and science fiction. I loved the Ursula K Le Guin Wizard of Earthsea books. Fantasy at that age is about pure imagination, and what those books showed me is that the whole world is at your fingertips if you write. And before that, the Narnia books: I remember spending a fair amount of time in wardrobes hoping to get through and see a talking fawn.Which writers have most influenced your own writing?In terms of contemporary fiction, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje and Toni Morrison. Also 19th-century writers: the Brontë sisters in particular, and Dickens. The idea of the big, fat complicated story is what’s influenced me most.Which genres do you most enjoy?Story-driven literary fiction: a really good writer telling a really good story.Are there any you avoid?I can’t bear any sort of romantic fiction: anything soppy or chicklitty or girly. It brings me out in hives. I’m not saying I don’t write about romance or relationships. But I want those people to have complex lives. It really annoys me in a book if people don’t have jobs or never worry about the gas bill.Is there a book or author you always return to?I would read anything by the Norwegian journalist Åsne Seierstad – she wrote The Bookseller of Kabul and One of Us, about the Anders Breivik killings. She’s a really good long-form journalist. And Janet Malcolm – I’m a big fan of hers.Which literary figures – dead or alive – would you most like to meet?The Brontës, but they can leave Branwell at home. I’d like to tell Emily that even though Wuthering Heights got really bad reviews and was compared very unfavourably with Jane Eyre, now people consider it superior. And I’d like to beg her not to destroy her second novel.What books are on your bedside table to read next?Top of the list is Rife: Twenty-One Stories from Britain’s Youth, which is an anthology edited by Nikesh Shukla and Sammy Jones. Also Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other. I’m reading Elif Sharak’s 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in this Strange World at the moment and loving it. And Will Storr’s The Science of Storytelling because I’m interested in how the human brain invents and consumes narrative.• Platform Seven by Louise Doughty is published by Faber (£14.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s start with a beautiful example of nominative determinism. Isabella Tree’s Wilding has affected Wellfitbooty “more than any book I’ve read in many years”:It’s the story of a large farm in Sussex, England, which chose about 20 years ago to stop intensive farming and allow its lands to return to nature. It is now home to many threatened species, including the turtle dove and emperor butterfly is home to all 5 species of British owl, 11 species of bats – and countless other insects and birds.The author is one of the owners and the style is very readable and engaging – in fact I couldn’t put it down. The principles in the book can be applied to gardens of any size … I wholeheartedly recommend it.The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 and ¾ by Sue Townsend still works for writeronthestorm:Taking me back to my childhood when I borrowed this off my older brother and thought it was hilarious… It still stands up as a funny and enjoyable read. I’ve got the next couple of books in the series and will move onto them at some point.For the 15th time I think. I call it my summer book. It never fails to delight me.Mission To Tashkent by Frederick Marshman Bailey has impressed SchwarzwaldBummel:An incredible true-story romp about an English spy hired by Lenin’s Cheka to capture himself. Bailey a national treasure who deserves more recognition.“Thank you to everyone on here who recommended Elizabeth Taylor,” says Rick2016. “Without Tips, Links and Suggestions I’d never have discovered Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which proved wonderful”:It’s a quiet, understated book, but every line is so well crafted and has such power. The lessons it teaches are, when you write them down, obvious. Everyone needs love, physical contact, to feel wanted and like their company is a pleasure, not a burden. And yet it’s so easy to forget that everybody else feels these things in the cavalcade and clamour of everyday life.. Elizabeth Taylor’s empathy, compassion and ability to portray the irreducible human core of her characters are utterly remarkable and I thoroughly recommend Mrs Palfrey ... to anyone who hasn’t read it.More good work by you guys: FrogC has started reading When Mystical Creatures Attack by Kathleen Founds, “following a tip from a reader of this column”:It’s a series of linked short stories about a high-school class in Texas, most of them troubled, and their teacher who is equally so, being confined in a sort of capitalist asylum where they give Wellness Points(TM) for fulfilling various therapeutic tasks. The construction is ingenious - you might say gimmicky, but I like that kind of thing: the title story, for example, consists of the essays written by the students on how their favourite mythical creature might solve some world problem (though a lot of the problems chosen, inevitably, are on a more personal scale). Funny and moving. I love the fact that the most feared teacher is referred to simply as “The Sir”.Alexia_R has been pleased to pick up The Runaways by Fatima Bhutto:I picked this up on a whim in Foyles because it was a beautiful, signed copy. It’s a fast-paced story of three Pakistani young people (one of them British-Pakistani), negotiating their culture, religion etc. One of them is gay and struggling to accept it, another is from a very privileged background, another is from a slum of Karachi. I can’t say too much about the plot without giving it away. I was absolutely loving this and was about to praise it to the skies but I wasn’t too sure about the ending. Still, very good.RedmonT has almost finished Purity by Jonathan Franzen:Not quite as good as The Corrections and Freedom, but then that might only be because of how the account of Tom and Annabel’s relationship makes me feel. It’s awful – the feeling of dread I felt throughout that section, the nerves, the butterflies, the absurd behaviour. It’s been a long time since a book made me feel that way.He is amazing at threading stories together. It doesn’t even matter that it’s occasionally haphazard - realising things in a non-linear order affects the way you realise them (and changes what you thought you knew).

When I tell people that I am spending my break swimming in the North Sea off Yorkshire, reactions tend to run from “you’re brave” to “why would you do that?”. Which I imagine is similar to the comments I’d get if I announced I was taking a week to visit prisoners with whole-life orders. But I maintain that true pleasure requires not much more than an RNLI-supervised beach, a tide table and a novel to read between dips.The British seaside is tragically underappreciated and disastrously underfunded. A lack of year-round jobs and lousy transport links are driving its residents away: four in 10 coastal towns are forecast to suffer a decline in their population of under-30s, with those in the north worst affected. Even the south-west, which attracts nearly half of the visitors to Britain’s coast, is struggling. Places that are a hive of cute tearooms and sun-dappled tourists in the summer pull down their shutters at the end of the season the holidaymakers leave and a bleak and empty winter sets in.From the late 19th century to the mid-20th, though, Britain’s coastal towns formed a halo of small paradises around the edge of the island, initially driven by the craze for spa towns. This history is visible in once magnificent, now often derelict, architecture, such as the painfully neglected Birnbeck pier at Weston-super-Mare. In Scarborough, the Grand Hotel overlooks the South Bay in Victorian splendour formerly a refuge for the wealthiest tourists, it was dogged by food poisoning scares in the 2000s and you can now stay for less than it costs to put up in the nearby Travelodge.Railway ads from the 1920s and 30s show the leisure and luxury that a trip to the seaside promised. Come to Blackpool and find a glamorous redhead reading on the yellow sand, back enticingly bare in a halterneck costume, the illuminations of the tower glinting overhead. Filey in North Yorkshire is painted as an art deco paradise, enjoyed by a beatific trio of mother, father and toddler in elegant bathing suits. (There’s a less salubrious seaside than the train companies chose to show, as well: fresh air in your lungs, money in your pocket and strangers on the esplanade could give a person ideas.)But in the 1950s, postwar prosperity combined with the growth of civil aviation to suck tourism away from Britain’s coast and now place names such as Skegness and Minehead have a distinctly bathetic sound. My childhood didn’t involve many trips to the seaside and those I remember didn’t involve going in the sea much. In Robin Hood’s Bay in Yorkshire, I bothered the inhabitants of rock pools, but I never went deeper than my shins. This was understandable, given that in the 1980s a lot of Britain’s beaches were disgusting and my parents probably didn’t care to turn their toddlers loose in a soup of litter and sewage.It also deserves to be more than a period piece, although part of the seaside’s joy is definitely nostalgia. Sitting at a chrome and Formica table in Scarborough’s Harbour Bar, ordering ice-cream sundaes with names such as peach Melba and pear Valentino (after Dame Nellie and, presumably, Rudolph) will put a person in a pleasantly old-fashioned state of mind. And when you are cold all the way through your internal organs from 10 minutes in the waves, it’s a scalding builder’s tea you want and not a flat white.The reason we should be investing in, and protecting, the beauties of Britain’s seaside isn’t so we can live in an imaginary version of the past, though. The number of saltwater lidos and wrought-iron piers lost to vandalism and council indolence is sickening: we should be saving those things so we can go on using them. The gorgeous art deco Jubilee Pool in Penzance underwent seemingly catastrophic damage in 2014, but was rescued by the community and shows how even the most dilapidated bits of our coastal heritage can be revived.Part of the reason that seaside structures are so vulnerable to carelessness is, of course, that the sea is a wild place: maintaining anything is a constant battle against lashing winds and erosion. (Maybe the proximity to wildness is what made coastal resorts such as Brighton destinations for sexual freedom.) One of the thrills of going back to the same cliffs again and again is seeing the rocks reshape with each visit. The impossibility of developing fragile coastal land is a salvation for wildlife – a few steps from the road, you’ll find the air busy with insect life, and swallows feasting on the wing.I’m keeping my favourite beach to myself – I’m not sure I want to share it with golden-age numbers of tourists – but there’s plenty of room on Britain’s coast for more visitors. Take yourself to the seaside, e all the way in, fill up on chips and ice cream and don’t forget about the coast when summer is over.• Sarah Ditum is a writer on politics and culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aec428b7a41c8b41e42184d60f041d0bc540cd7/0_150_4818_2891/master/4818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f19865231370636c9207ca7f7b5bb67","title":"last wek i gazed on truly wild land and saw art reflected back","story":"Humans created their societies in defiance of nature, but it still has the power to instil aweAchmore is a nondescript hamlet on the A858 that cuts across the isle of Lewis and Harris in the Outer Hebrides. This is a gnarled, fractured landscape, swaddled in wind and rain, and built out of some of the oldest rocks on Earth – Lewisian gneiss, the bedrock of the island, is some 3bn years old, two-thirds the age of Earth itself.We had gone to Achmore to search out an ancient stone circle. There are dozens of these, including the most famous one at Calanais, scattered across Lewis’s melancholic moorland. The Achmore stone circle was disappointing, with little to catch the eye. But then we turned to look south. And almost gasped. For Lewis’s forbidding landscape, caught in a delicate light suffused through the late-afternoon cloud, had been transformed, becoming draped in an ethereal, almost unreal, beauty. Dozens of lochans – small lochs – dappled the foreground. Behind them, where the hills of Harris rose, were layer upon soft layer of pastel colours, from gold through green to blue, laid like chiffon scarves across the horizon.I love bleakness. Not as a human condition but as a physical landscape. Not for me the well-tended orchards of Kent or the Constable-painted loveliness of the Stour valley. Give me, rather, the menace of Dartmoor, the strangeness of Orford Ness on the Suffolk coast, the emptiness of Ranoch Moor in the Scottish Highlands and most of all the dark, brooding allure of the Western Isles of the Outer Hebrides and the Northern Isles of Orkney and the Shetlands. These are all places that can be desolate, even hostile. Yet they are also landscapes imbued with beauty, even grace, such as that moorland in Lewis.As a human condition, bleakness suggests that one is in a place empty of joy or hope. Much of the landscape that we call bleak is bleak in a different way – because it isn’t manicured or domesticated. There is a wildness about it by which we can be discomfited and yet often also celebrate and romanticise.In his book The Wild Places, Robert Macfarlane, one of the most expressive nature writers of our time, observes that throughout history there have been two broad responses to wildness. On the one hand, it is perceived as “a dangerous force that confounds the order-bringing pursuits of human culture and agriculture”. On the other is a perception of wildness “as an energy both exemplary and exquisite, and of wild places as realms of miracle, ersity and abundance”. Wildness as a threat and wildness as a refuge.Neither perspective, though, captures humanity’s complex, entangled relationship with the wild. Human societies have in large part been carved out in defiance of nature. From the houses we build to shelter us from the elements to the medicines we develop to protect us from pathogens, from the piped water without which millions still die from diarrhoea and other illnesses, to the weather stations that provide warnings of hurricanes and heat waves, we are constantly in a struggle to shield ourselves from nature’s furies. There is a rational root to the fear of the wild and of the threat that it can pose.At the same time, the eulogisation of nature, and a yearning for a wilderness that has been lost or despoiled, is inextricably human. There are many threads to such a yen. For some, the depredations caused by human activity, from river pollution to global warming, outweigh the benefits. Along with human development has developed a disdain of progress and civilisation. For others, modernity and urbanisation have brought with them a spiritual loss, a severing of our elemental ties with nature.Whatever the roots, wildness does not simply lie “out there”, but inside, in the human imagination. We project upon the wild the fears and hopes, the emotions and passions, nurtured by history and culture and community. It is through culture and imagination that we imbue the wild with meaning.The beauty of the Western Isles and the Northern Isles is remarkable, their wildness and bleakness something to be treasured. But when I look upon them, what I see is coloured by far more than the landscape itself. It is a landscape created in the novels of George Mackay Brown, the poetry of Kevin MacNeil, the paintings of Wendy Sutherland, the photography of Rebecca Marr, the writings of Macfarlane. That, too, is remarkable and something to be treasured."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df178c09a8d7005c6143cde1994f088dbfae423/310_0_2538_1524/master/2538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=673c2d485d6ea2779aedde7ed62837f3","title":"english a level tell us whats driving the drop in take up of the subject","story":"We want to hear from students and teachers why English is declining as a choice for A-level pupilsOnce a popular subject choice for sixth formers, schools are now seeing a sharp drop in the take-up of English literature and language at A-level.Some blame the recently reformed English GCSEs for “sucking the joy” out of the subject, while others suggest the push for vocational secondary education is stopping people from choosing it.We want to hear from students, educators, parentss about why you think fewer people are studying English at A-level.

Weirdly, this sprightly, self-aware action-adventure movie does. Director James Bobin and co-writer Nicholas Stoller launch with the cartoon’s memorably bouncy theme tune. Within minutes, a six-year-old Dora (Madelyn Miranda) is breaking the fourth wall and asking the audience if they can say “delicioso” (in the original TV show, Dora would teach viewers Spanish words and phrases). Dora’s simian compadre Boots is computer-animated and integrated into the film’s ever-so-slightly surreal live-action world without question.Dora has grown up in the rainforests of Peru, home-schooled by her parents (a zoologist and an archeologist, played by Eva Longoria and Michael Peña respectively). They are explorers, the film insists, not treasure hunters, in one of its gentle swipes at colonialism. Now 16 years old, Dora (Isabela Moner) is being sent to the city, aka Los Angeles, to attend high school with her cousin Diego (Jeff Wahlberg) while her parents search for Parapata, the lost Incan city of gold. A relentlessly cheery brainiac with a propensity to burst into song, she soon earns the nickname Dorka, turning up to a themed school dance dressed as her “favourite star” – the sun. Moner is a magnetic, sunny screen presence. Seeing Dora navigate the wilds of high school would’ve been entertaining enough, but a kidnapping places her and her classmates back in the jungle.In this section of the film, there are Jungle Run-style mazes and puzzles, a farting bog of quicksand and a song about poo. A field of giant pink flowers precedes a trippy, animated interlude. Benicio del Toro voices a masked trickster fox. The result is goofily charming and a rare, age-appropriate children’s film in which the adults are silly and the kids, especially the girls, are smart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac591bd0d32ee607948cc5731deb752de0c77e5/213_0_2456_1474/master/2456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63c333957b22ebacf1d08c3b2f09814e","title":"peter fonda a life in pictures","story":"The actor best remembered for Easy Rider has died at the age of 79.

I had one just a few minutes ago. Kippers or smoked haddock are a nice treat. I have quite a thing about having a fish on its own on the plate.Dad died in a car accident when I was six. I’ve since discovered that in situations like that, one of the children – often the youngest, like me – will take on the role of “hero child”. Not out of any grand gesture necessarily, it just tends to happen. I’d peel spuds, top and tail gooseberries, dish out tripe and generally be Mum’s kitchen helper. She often said: “If you can’t cook eggs, Robert, you can’t be a chef.” My scrambled, especially, are very good.I used to like getting cups and putting tiny bits of food and liquids in them. I’d grow mould plumes in the dark wardrobe of my little back bedroom. Not to eat them, mind – just to admire the growing power.Mum was a cook for most of her life. During the war, she’d been with the Ministry of Food, going around the country showing people how to best use egg powder. That frugality lasted – I remember as a kid, when we visited the butcher she’d often ask for lots of “bacon bones”.In the 1950s, my mum ran hotels with my dad – him doing admin, her the food. I’ve sat outside a few pubs they ran, like the Bell Inn in Epping, and wondered about them working together. After Dad died, Mum was teaching cookery at a secondary school. She’d cook all day, so didn’t really want to cook again for four boys when she returned home knackered.I once accidentally set fire, with a sparkler, to a box of fireworks and threw them from the living room into Mum’s kitchen. They scorched the Formica and the lino, so I got down on my hands and knees, crying, and cleaned the marks with a Brillo pad, then half an hour later walked back into the living room, which was ablaze. You’d think you’d get a right rollicking from Mum for burning the house down, but it was too desperate a situation and her priority was not to shout at me at all.When I went fishing with mates as a kid I’d usually have strawberry jam or banana sandwiches on Mother’s Pride with sugar sprinkled all over. At one point I was putting 17 sugars in my tea. I know it’s unbelievable and I do wonder sometimes what my mum was thinking to allow it. The weirdest thing was that if I had 18 teaspoons it was too sweet. I suppose if I was trying to analyse it, losing my dad was more upsetting than I would have realised, yet I got quite a kick out of sugar.We tend to head down to Hampshire to fish. I’ll set off with no food at all, but on the way down I’ll pick up my pocket meats – scotch egg, sausage roll – and a lump of cheese. All the things I’m not meant to eat in my pocket to nibble during the day. Nic Roeg said, “You can get away, but you can’t get away from yourself”, but I can look at my watch, expecting half an hour has passed and realise it’s been hours and I certainly think in those hours I’ve got away from myself.I launched Cadbury’s Boost bar. For years and years my mum had asked, “When are you going to go back to your job as a solicitor?” But once she saw me in Boost commercials she realised I could make a living outside law. They were expensive ads filmed in the south of Spain with loads of cowboys and a big catering budget. It was lobsters in tents in the middle of a desert brought to me with sparkling wine.I can’t remember ever cooking food to impress a woman. The idea’s quite cheesy and sort of makes my skin crawl. But I sometimes make a special effort to impress my cats, with chicken liver or something. It’s tricky to know if a cat’s impressed. They might give me a little look, a glimpse at least. That’s cat ownership for you.There’s lots of food in the new series of Big Night Out. We have a hotdog sausage, its appearance activated by buzzer, which we use as a full stop in medical arguments between doctors. We’ve often used slices of white bread as facial disguise, with holes for our eyes. It’s benign, because no one wearing bread means you terrible harm. We look for items, often food, which have a benign feeling. Corned beef, for instance, seems very useful for what we do. In the last series we ate a whole can while sexy music played.I got married at a registry office, at 9 o’clock in the morning, and was crying during the ceremony. I had to be at hospital at 10.30 for my heart op, so we had time to go for a great big cafe fry-up, meant to be my last, although it hasn’t been, if truth be known. When I arrived at the hospital the nurses presented me with a big chocolate cake as a wedding present. I thought it a little odd on a heart ward, but my old pipes were about to go, so there was no point being kind to them.I always put prunes in my salads. Or pears, water chestnuts, celery. Those sorts of stringy foods. I’m not trying to be scientific, but I’ve been told by the experts who look after me that the body uses bad cholesterol to digest that stuff. Then you shoot out your bad cholesterol, basically. Happy days.In my kitchen is an old-fashioned sweet jar with a cow’s heart in it with an arrow through it. It was given to me as a gift after my operation. The blood red of a heart and the chrome silver of the arrow are a useful reminder of the damage you could do to your heart in a kitchen.FoodBecause of heart disease I should avoid steak and kidney pie and stilton cheese, which is about number three in cheeses with the highest amount of fat.

Don’t judge meI’m about to go holiday, and though the prospect is delightful, one thing is worrying me: the coffee situation. For the last few years, a group of us have rented a big, old house somewhere in deepest France. It’s a place I love as much as anywhere I’ve ever stayed: you will know what I mean when I say that it’s the kind of house where you want only to read Colette, and eat apricots, and lie in the bath with a large glass of rosé while listening to Francoise Hardy (you might want to pretend that you are Francoise Hardy, I couldn’t possibly comment). However, there is a problem, and that is the aforementioned coffee situation.The house has an old-fashioned percolator, but only one. There are no cafetieres, no stove-top devices, and no Nespresso machine. (I can no more imagine a Nespresso machine on its ancient kitchen counters than I can a go-go dancer.) But we are 10, at least. How to make sure there is enough coffee for everyone? In the past, we have used the percolator to fill a huge teapot with Costa Rican, after which we then immediately run it again for a second round.This, however, is both unsatisfactory, and un-chic. Should I pack my own cafetiere this year? I have considered this. But we’re travelling easyJet, and I think I would rather use my baggage allowance for another pair of sandals than a coffee pot. (Earlier today, I experimented, and tried to put a pair of sandals inside a cafetiere - alas, only one shoe would fit.)Thinking about this leads me to consider the problem of coffee-making generally. The perfect cup of coffee is like the perfect lipstick: a quest that will end only with your death. I disapprove of Nespresso machines and their ilk, and I don’t particularly like the coffee they make either. Cafetieres are so messy and gritty, and I never seem to get the coffee-to-water ratio quite right also, the coffee gets cold so quickly. I love my blackened stove-top Bialetti for reasons to do with nostalgia and all-round stylishness, but it makes pretty mud-like coffee: good for days when you’re knackered, but very bad indeed when the last thing you need is to be wired like Frankenstein. The huge, orange Italian espresso machine that I bought at vast expense some years ago looks fantastic. But working it is such a performance, and the coffee it makes always tastes of its metallic bowels to me.I think the best method at home is the most simple. Drip, drip, drip: like a percolator, only without the stewing effect of the hotplate. I have a china filter and I line it with a (recycled) paper filter, and that’s my morning cup – just as my dad used to make his in 1976. (His beans, incidentally, were roasted by Pollards of Sheffield, a business, established in 1879, that is still going strong and which now has a website, should you, too, be an exile.)This is no good for large numbers – unless, of course, you set out 10 cups and 10 filters – but the coffee it makes is at once rich and gentle, and the grounds are so easily dealt with. It takes a little while, but this is a good thing: as you wait, you can stare out of the window, pause for a moment before you begin your day. In these anxious times, such kitchen rituals are nothing short of a life raft.Of course, I’m not the only dripper around. Our numbers are growing exponentially, this being, I gather, the hipster’s method of choice. But in the 21st century, nothing is allowed to be simple for long – or at any rate, a thing’s simplicity must always be augmented made more refined. A company called Kinto makes what it calls a brewer stand set. It comprises a wooden base, a brass pole at the top of which is a brass filter, and a glass jug that holds four cups of coffee. Naturally, it is made in Japan. It costs – wait for it – £180. Yet even as I laugh at this, a feeling comes over me that is all too familiar. I might as well be at an Apple counter, about to buy yet another shade of matt rose. This bit of kit could be life changing … couldn’t it? Answers on an old bag of Ethiopian mocha Djimmah, please.

With a little bit of patience (and perhaps a few shortcuts), you’ll find that there is more than a grain of truth to how versatile (and straightforward) rice really is.This vegan platter is great served at room temperature, so you can get ahead and prepare the rice, roasted vegetables and dressing up to a few hours in advance, assembling everything to serve.Prep 15 minCook 55 minServes 4 as a side or part of a spread125g black riceSalt and black pepper½ small butternut squash (500g), peeled, seeds discarded and cut into 1cm thick half-moons2 fennel bulbs (600g), trimmed and cut into 1cm slices2 red chillies, 1 left whole and 1 thinly sliced (deseeded if you don’t like heat) 1½ tsp fennel seeds, crushed 75ml olive oil3 tbsp maple syrup 1 small garlic bulb, top trimmed to expose the cloves2 banana shallots (100g), skin on, tops trimmed to expose the flesh 1 tbsp lemon juice5g dill, finely chopped5g chives, finely choppedHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Put the rice in a medium saucepan with plenty of water, put on a medium heat, bring to a boil and cook for 35 minutes, then add a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Continue to cook for five minutes, until cooked but with a slight bite, then drain very well and transfer to a large bowl.As the rice cooks, put the butternut squash, fennel, the whole chilli and fennel seeds in a large, 40 x 30cm tray lined with baking paper, and add two tablespoons of oil, two and a half tablespoons of maple syrup, a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Mix well, then spread out as much as possible. Drizzle a little oil over the garlic bulb and shallots, wrap inidually in foil and put in the corners of the tray. Roast for about 40 minutes, until the vegetables are golden brown.Transfer half the fennel and squash to the rice bowl, reserving the rest to top the rice with.Once cool enough to handle, discard the foil and squeeze the shallots and garlic into the small bowl of a food processor, discarding the papery skins. Add a tablespoon of oil, the remaining half-tablespoon of maple syrup, half the lemon juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and blitz to a smooth paste, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the paste to the rice and veg mixture and gently combine, then transfer to a large serving plate.Top with the remaining roasted vegetables. Mix the herbs with the sliced chilli, the remaining lemon juice, the remaining two tablespoons of oil and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt. Stir together, spoon over the vegetables and serve.I use a shop-bought, cooked brown basmati and wild rice mix here, but you can just as easily use leftover home-cooked rice (white, brown or whatever you have on hand). Make sure you start frying very soon after the batter has been mixed, because it doesn’t sit very well. Try to get good-quality kimchi for this it really makes all the difference.Prep 25 minCook 1 hr 5 minChill 30 minMakes 12 fritters, serving four as a snack3 tbsp olive oil½ onion (75g), peeled and finely chopped Salt3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed200ml whole milk1 x 250g packet cooked brown basmati and wild rice mix (or any other combination of cooked rice) 2 eggs, yolks and whites separated500g good-quality classic kimchi (I like The Cultured Collective brand)80g green beans, trimmed and finely chopped1½ tbsp coriander, finely chopped80g gruyere, cut into 1½cm cubes 2 tbsp mixed black and white sesame seeds, toasted, plus 1½ tsp, toasted, to serve90g plain flourAbout 800ml sunflower oil, for frying2 lemons juiced to get 2 tbsp, the rest cut into wedges, to serveAdd the olive oil, onion and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt to a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat and fry for six minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Add the garlic and continue to fry for 30 seconds to a minute, until fragrant.Add the milk, lower the heat to medium and simmer gently for five minutes, until thickened and reduced slightly. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for five minutes, then stir in the rice, egg yolks and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until completely cool.Meanwhile, set 160g of the kimchi aside, to serve. Squeeze the remaining kimchi through a sieve, collecting three tablespoons of the liquid in a small serving bowl (set this aside for later), and transferring the drained kimchi solids to a chopping board (you should have 320g). Roughly chop the kimchi, then add to the pan with the cooled rice mixture, along with the green beans, coriander, gruyere, sesame seeds and flour. Stir until fully combined.Whip the egg whites, by hand or with an electric whisk, until you get stiff peaks, then gently fold through the rice mixture until combined.Heat the sunflower oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat until it reaches about 180C350F. Test the oil is hot enough by dropping in a tiny bit of batter it should sizzle but not colour straight away. Fry the fritters in four batches (three at a time), to avoid lowering the temperature of the oil too much. Using a large serving spoon, carefully drop 95g of batter per fritter into the oil, and fry for four to five minutes, turning a few times, until golden-brown all over turn the heat down if they’re browning too quickly. Transfer the fritters to a tray lined with kitchen paper, and continue in this way with the remaining batter.Add the lemon juice to the bowl with the reserved kimchi liquid. Transfer the fritters to a large platter, sprinkling over the remaining sesame seeds and a light sprinkling of salt. Serve hot with the kimchi sauce, lemon wedges and the reserved kimchi alongside.I have published a recipe for dirty rice before, and it included ground meat and offal, which give this southern dish, which I picked up in New Orleans, its usual stained look.This non-traditional, but equally delicious vegetarian version (or vegan, if you leave out the butter) uses caramelised onions, black garlic and chestnuts to generate serious flavours and that signature “dirty” look.Cajun spice blends vary in levels of heat and added salt, so you may need to adjust how much you add according to taste.Prep 20 minCook 35 minServes 4 as a side200g basmati rice85ml olive oil Salt7 garlic cloves, peeled, 4 finely sliced and 3 crushed50g unsalted butter (or an extra 50ml olive oil, to keep it vegan)3 onions, peeled and finely chopped (350g)180g ready-cooked and peeled chestnuts, finely chopped25g black garlic (about 15 cloves), finely chopped1½ tbsp Cajun spice blend (I use Bart’s)150ml vegetable stock or water 10g parsley, finely chopped1 tbsp lemon juiceAdd the rice, two teaspoons of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and 400ml boiling water to a medium saucepan, for which you have a lid, on a medium-high heat. Turn the heat to low, cover the pan and leave to cook for 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside, covered, for 10 minutes before fluffing up with a fork.While the rice is cooking, heat three tablespoons of oil in a very small pan on a medium heat. Once hot, fry the sliced garlic, stirring to separate the slices, until pale golden – about two minutes. Watch that you don’t cook it further, or it may burn and turn bitter. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the garlic to a paper-lined plate, reserving the oil. Sprinkle the fried garlic with a little salt and set aside.Add the butter, remaining two tablespoons of oil, onions and crushed garlic to a large, nonstick saute pan on a high heat. Fry for about 14 minutes, resisting the urge to stir too often, until the onions are a deep golden-brown. The onions should catch on the bottom of the pan every now and then, but shouldn’t burn, so turn the heat down if necessary.Reduce the heat to medium-high, add the chestnuts, black garlic, Cajun spices and a half-teaspoon of salt, and continue to fry for seven minutes, stirring every now and then, until everything is a deep, dark-brown colour, but not burned.Stir the rice into the mixture until fully combined, and increase the heat to high. Once the rice at the bottom of the pan begins to crisp up a little – two to three minutes – add the stock and cook, undisturbed, until it has evaporated – another two minutes or so. Remove from the heat, stir through the parsley, garlic slices, lemon juice and reserved garlic oil, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32aeb4fcffd537c746910fe6c03591a4766e67b9/0_257_4828_2898/master/4828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b47129eb5885523f95d7f6e542c38843","title":"norwich newcastle premier league match report","story":"Norwich earned their first Premier League victory of the season with ease, brushing a limited Newcastle aside thanks to a hat-trick from Teemu Pukki.Daniel Farke’s team dominated the match from the off, while the visitors ended the game in disarray after a clinical display of finishing by the Canaries’ No 22. Steve Bruce will also have an anxious wait to see the extent of an injury suffered by Joelinton, while Jonjo Shelvey scored a consolation in added time.Anyone who had seen Norwich’s opening fixture against Liverpool would have known that the Canaries are in the Premier League to attack. So there wasn’t much in the way of surprise when the hosts began to move the ball with pace and intent from the opening whistle.Their first chance came after five minutes after fullback Max Aarons released Pukki down the right-hand side. The Finn cut the ball back to Todd Cantwell, who was unmarked just six yards out, but the 21-year-old saw his cheeky flick smothered by Martin Dubravka.Three minutes later and Pukki had the next opportunity for himself, dragging a shot wide of Dubravka’s far post after a lengthy spell of flowing possession. Another 60 seconds later, however, and Norwich could have been behind as Matt Ritchie’s first time cross found Emil Krafth free in the box only for the Swedish international, making his debut at right wing-back, to screw his shot horribly over.That passage of play from one end to the other summed up the initial approach of both teams. Norwich wanted to dominate and the visitors were content to wait for their moment, disrupt the play and work a quick cross into the box, a tactic which had left Norwich so exposed at Anfield. It was lent further credence in the 26th minute, when Issac Hayden whipped a ball over Grant Hanley’s head from an ordinary position on the right flank, only for Joelinton to also place his header over.Newcastle had the best chances but Norwich had more of them and in the 32nd minute they deservedly took the lead. It came from a corner, sent in by Emi Buendía from the Norwich right. It was controlled in the area by Marco Stiepermann then worked out to Buendía again who delivered a deeper cross in a dangerous area. Paul Dummett got up to flick a header away, but the ball only spilled to the edge of the box. And that was where Pukki was waiting. The Finn made the call, hit the right foot volley and drove the ball past Dubravka for his second goal of the season.Norwich maintained their lead until half time and Newcastle came out after the restart with renewed vigour. They forced a series of corners and in the 59th minute Shelvey forced Krul to save low at his near post after the midfielder had been allowed to drift unchallenged into the Norwich box. The visitors looked like they had a foothold in the game, and then Pukki struck again.Jamal Lewis began the move by finding Cantwell, who  his marker and drove towards the box before laying off to Pukki on the left hand side of the area. It wasn’t a particularly promising position, but Pukki simply cut back inside and hit a shot low, true and beyond the ing Dubravka.Two-nil is a dangerous scoreline, but Newcastle showed no signs of realising it. Shortly after Pukki’s second, his £40m opposite number, Joelinton, collapsed to the ground and was forced off with an ankle injury.This had a visible effect on the visitors whose intensity dropped right off and soon Norwich, and Pukki, had their third. Cantwell provided the assist for a second time, dribbling into the area after a long move. He tapped the ball to Pukki who cut in right to left this time and once again his finish was true.An unmarked Shelvey struck for Newcastle with 60 seconds of added time remaining, the only blemish on an otherwise perfect summer’s afternoon for Norwich."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4a742934a0538164aaa1bd0af31d067d7ff22e2/0_238_4495_2697/master/4495.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bf0ee376d0c26347b92ee45d7807c31","title":"southampton liverpool premier league match report","story":"It was not dull but Liverpool squeaked over the line. Just as a tricky afternoon after precious little sleep and preparation seemed to have turned into a breeze, a calamitous error by Adrián allowed Southampton a sniff of the points after goals by Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino had given the visitor’s a healthy two-goal cushion.How Adrián must want to see the back of a week that featured his full Liverpool debut, a Super Cup victory, a freak injury sustained in the celebrations in Istanbul and then a true blooper here. After receiving a simple backpass from Virgil van Dijk, the keeper made a pig’s ear of a routine clearance, which cannoned straight against Danny Ings and into the net.Ings had scored against his former club and the Southampton substitute should have equalised moments later but failed to convert at the near post after charging on to Yan Valery’s low cross.For long periods, punctuated by Mané’s wonderful strike just before the interval, Liverpool were leggy and played like a team that had been given one session to prepare for this match. The squad returned from home after a penalty shootout victory over Chelsea in Turkey at 4.30am on Thursday and headed to Melwood for training six-and-a-half hours later. Twenty-four hours after that, they boarded another flight, this time to Southampton. The travelling appeared to have taken its toll and Liverpool’s sloppiness was encapsulated by Adrián’s slip-up seven minutes from time.Adrián received treatment on an ankle that Jürgen Klopp said had “swollen like an elephant’s” on the plane home. Andy Lonergan, the 35-year-old who was a free agent until mid-July, was named on the bench, while the young Irish keeper Caoimhin Kelleher also formed part of the travelling party.Adrián passed a fitness test to ease Klopp’s goalkeeping headache but the manager decided to freshen up his starting lineup by making three changes, with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Georginio Wijnaldum and Firmino replacing Joe Gomez, Jordan Henderson and Fabinho.Klopp also fielded his fabled front three of Mané, Firmino and Mohamed Salah for the first time since the Champions League final.Until Mané’s beautiful, caressed finish, it was a harum-scarum first half that provided painful viewing for Klopp, powerless as his players huffed and puffed, their overcooked and wonky passes bobbling out of touch. Southampton’s five-man midfield overran Liverpool’s rather meek three.There was a skewed shot by Salah that arced over the crossbar and a tired handball from James Milner – who spent several minutes receiving treatment after a clash of heads with James Ward-Prowse – as well as two instances of slack defending that allowed Che Adams to sneak into the channels to almost devastating effect. Van Dijk hoovered after Nathan Redmond’s ball over the top eluded a dozing Matip.Adams passed up Southampton’s best first-half opening when he headed a sweeping first-time cross by Oriol Romeu over the bar and Southampton were punished seven minutes later. Milner nudged the ball into the path of Mané, who stepped inside Jan Bednarek, keeping Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg at arm’s length before effortlessly curling the ball beyond a helpless Angus Gunn.Ralph Hasenhüttl, who had preached calm when groans from the stands met a long Bednarek backpass, stood hands-on-hips, baffled as to how his team had fallen behind despite dominating for large spells.It was a reminder of Liverpool’s stealth and a ruthlessness that has long eluded the Saints, who had their visitors on the ropes on several occasions. Valery failed to strike the ball with any conviction after Redmond and Adams exchanged possession down the left, with Adrián making a strong left-handed save. Liverpool also carved a couple of openings but always appeared vulnerable in defence.The frontline, though, has always been Liverpool’s pièce de résistance under Klopp, just as Southampton’s achilles heel has been an inability to keep the ball out of their own net. After the break, Liverpool ratcheted through the gears and poured forward as Southampton’s defence began to wilt.First, Bednarek did well to intervene after Salah slid in Firmino inside the box before Mané laid the ball on a plate for Firmino, only for the Brazilian to fluff his lines.Earlier Salah had failed to steer the ball into the corner, with Gunn spreading his legs to deny Liverpool a second.But eventually Firmino came up with the goods. When Ward-Prowse gifted possession to Liverpool on the edge of the box, the striker danced inside and displayed strength and composure before squeezing the ball into the corner beyond Gunn.Andy Robertson then thundered a volley wide after Mané, excellent on his return to St Mary’s, flicked the ball into his path but it was Ings who struck next when the striker seized on Adrián’s error. Saints should have then found parity but Ings squandered a golden chance to level."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab2a9bb927a190506c5fcf244642cdb85fe53a0/0_0_3120_1872/master/3120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db531ba87fec393c5b11dd6c0be51858","title":"manchester city v tottenham hotspur premier league live","story":"46 min: City are almost immediately on the attack, Walker sprinting down the right and whipping low towards the near post. Lloris does extremely well to gather a hard ball without spilling, Aguero lurking nearby.Here we go again! Spurs get the second half underway. No changes yet, though Lucas Moura and new boy Giovani Lo Celso have done plenty of warming up during the break. “We Liverpool faithful won’t believe it’s not the year until it’s statistically impossible,” sighs Roger Wallace, “and even then may hold out for City to be disqualified by some act of God. But I must admit some nerves when City look twice as dominant against Spurs as we do against Southampton.”Half-time entertainment. Our old pal Nick Ames has been to Berlin. Like Bowie, Eno and Fripp before him, he’s been very creative. Enjoy.Bernardo Silva performs some ball-glued-to-boot tricks out on the right. Rose eventually clatters him for his cheek. Then Lloris nearly gifts the ball to De Bruyne, but gets away with a weak pass. And then the whistle goes. It couldn’t come quickly enough for Spurs, who suddenly looked very ragged ... and not a little irritated at chasing shadows. A big half-time coming up for Mauricio Pochettino. Pep by contrast can get a cigar on.45 min: Spurs can’t get out of their final third. They’re desperate to hear the half-time whistle. They’ll need to get through an extra two minutes.43 min: And once again, City nearly punish Spurs after hypnotising them with their metronomic football. The ball’s suddenly slipped down the right for De Bruyne, who from the byline pulls back a pinpoint pass for Gundogan, rushing into the Spurs box. Gundogan meets it first time, and is inches away from passing the ball at speed into the bottom right. That would have been picture pretty.42 min: City continue to stroke it around the middle of the park. Spurs are being made to do a lot of running here.40 min: Lamela slips a long pass down the left, nearly releasing Kane. Ederson comes to the edge of his box to claim. Inches in it, but he gets to the ball ahead of the striker, and still inside his area to boot. Kane doesn’t look happy, claiming for something that presumably makes sense in his imagination. He’s just frustrated. It’s not about Ederson, is it.38 min: Bernardo Silva dances down the right and wedges a cross into a packed box. Easy pickings for Lloris. But the visitors are being run ragged again, after that brief mellow interlude. Such a strange rhythm to this match.36 min: De Bruyne sashays down the inside right, past Sanchez, leaving him spinning like a teenager after three cans of warm Special Brew. He’s clear in the box, with options in the middle. But he’s uncharacteristically foolish, slashing a wild shot high and miles right of the target. Spurs were in all sorts of trouble for a second there.As quick as a flash, City move up a gear. Bernardo Silva slips a ball down the right to release De Bruyne into space. De Bruyne flashes a low cross to the near post, where Aguero gets a yard on Alderweireld and flicks into the bottom right! Clinical. City lulled Spurs into a false sense of security there. Hypnotic.34 min: City try to regain some control. They stroke it around the midfield for a while. Baby steps. Then suddenly ...32 min: It’s all a bit scrappy at the moment. Such a contrast to the first 20 minutes, when City were so slick. Mauricio Pochettino will be delighted with his team’s response to falling behind.28 min: Ndombele slides in on De Bruyne and concedes a free kick 35 yards out, in a central position. Danger here. But City don’t make the most of the opportunity, instigating a lame game of head tennis in the Spurs box. Eventually Laporte, of all people, waves a leg at a loose ball and sends it looping towards Lloris.26 min: Nothing comes of the corner. Winks runs off down the right wing on the break, and is cynically tugged back by Sterling, who is booked for his sauce.25 min: Sterling skedaddles down the left and plays a ball through the six-yard box. Sissoko is on hand to slice out for a corner, with Bernardo Silva lurking. Sterling has Walker-Peters on toast.So, obviously, out of nothing, Spurs equalise! In strange super-slow motion as well. Ndombele wins the ball in the centre circle and lays off to Lamela, who is allowed to stride smoothly towards the City box. Lamela takes an early shot, opening his body and passing it past an extended Ederson and into the bottom left! Simple as that! A fine finish, but where on earth did that goal come from? And why were City so passive?22 min: That had been coming. A couple of bursts upfield apart, Spurs have been second best from the get-go. Illustrating their malaise, Harry Kane has only touched the ball on four occasions.This is such a sweet goal, yet so simple. Bernardo Silva dribbles slowly down the right, then checks and rolls a pass back up the wing for De Bruyne, who whips a vicious cross towards the back post. Sterling, rushing in, meets it with a glorious header, flush, sending the ball back across Lloris and into the right-hand portion of the net. What a move, what a finish. They’re not bad, this lot, are they?18 min: Rose takes another age over a throw. This time his stalling is so egregious that referee Michael Oliver is forced to come over and issue beneficial advice. If there’s any more of this, expect the yellow card to come out.16 min: Spurs have another drive at City. Aguero is bullied off the ball deep in Tottenham territory. That allows Kane to zip down the middle at great speed. He slips a pass wide right for Sissoko, who chips to the far stick for Lamela. A header’s sent goalwards, but it’s a harmless looping effort. At least City now know they’re in a game.15 min: Spurs haven’t done much in attack so far. Eriksen tries to address that with a determined dribble down the middle. He nearly successfully plays a wall pass off Lamela had it come off, he’d have been scampering into the City half with Kane for company. But Lamela can’t quite cushion the ball back to his team-mate. Better from Spurs, though.13 min: In fact, that tangle looks more like a penalty every time they show it. VAR, huh, kids.11 min: One corner leads to another. From the second, Lamela dances with Rodri, who goes down. He’s after a penalty kick. He’s not getting one, even though Lamela’s arm was around Rodri’s neck. You’ve certainly seen them given, but the VAR isn’t interested in overturning it. It would have been soft, but it was probably a spot kick. I guess they’ll be falling back on the “clear and obvious” get-out.10 min: De Bruyne, Gundogan and Sterling wreak havoc down the left. They very nearly open Spurs up with some cute triangles, but the last pass is deflected and a corner will suffice.8 min: City look lively, but then when do they not? Sterling has a shot that’s blocked and deflected out for a corner. Then after a quickly taken set piece, De Bruyne tries to thread one into the bottom right. Lloris claims. Spurs are doing their best to weather the storm, but they surely can’t go on like this.6 min: Zinchenko and Sterling combine again down the left. And once again Sterling is flagged offside. It was close, though. The Spurs back line are playing with fire. “It’s good to hear that Sky are still finding new and exciting new ways to entice me to leave the TV off until kick off,” writes David Flynn. You mean the MBM alone isn’t enough?5 min: Sterling nearly gets past Walker-Peters, as he twinkles down the left. Not quite. But City are coming at Spurs from all angles. The visitors have barely had a touch in these early exchanges.4 min: City continue to pass it around relentlessly. Zinchenko nearly releases Sterling down the left, but the City winger mistimes his run and the flag goes up.2 min: Rose takes a while over a throw, deep in Spurs territory. Clever move. Spurs started in a shaky fashion, they could do with finding their feet. And breathe.City get the big match underway! It’s not long before Bernardo Silva and De Bruyne are working their way down the right, forcing Alderweireld to hack clear. Then Sterling nearly gets onto a long pass down the left, but he’s ushered away from danger just when it looks as though he’ll latch onto the ball. A couple of statements of intent within the first 55 seconds or so.The teams are out! A cracking atmosphere for the first game of the new season at the home of the treble-winning champions. They wear their famous sky-blue shirts, while SpursSky Sports have had a chat with both managers. The main takeaway: Pep Guardiola has changed his line-up because he wants to give all his squad a run-out. “I want everyone involved. I want to see the players. We need everybody. If the players don’t play every game it could be two or three weeks without a game. I need to see them.” By contrast, Mauricio Pochettino has opted for his strongest side without any considerations regarding rotation. “It is so important that we pick the best starting XI. City love to dominate the midfield but we are strong there.”This is the second Saturday night match on Sky Sports under the new TV contract. And for some reason they’ve decided to stick with the wholly unnecessary innovation of sending pundit Jamie Redknapp out onto the pitch during the warm-up to take “a closer look” at a couple of the players. Last week it was Tanguy Ndombele, with reference to footage he’d already seen in the studio this week it’s Rodri, who was busy doing stretches 60 yards away. The long and the short of it, pretty much, is that the speck he sees in the distance is a “big unit”. Yes, well, this segment doesn’t work, does it. Having said that, it’s only a matter of time before poor old Jamie takes a loose one right in the clock, just like his old dad before him. It’s inevitable, and a possible reason why the producers are happy to keep this one going.The champions make four changes to the team named for the 5-0 win at West Ham last Saturday. Sergio Aguero, Bernardo Silva, Ilkay Gundogan and Nicolas Otamendi come in for John Stones, David Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus. Christian Eriksen returns to the Spurs starting line-up after coming on as substitute to turn around the opening-day fixture against Aston Villa. Lucas Moura makes way, the only change to Mauricio Pochettino’s side.Domestic treble-winners Manchester City versus Champions League runners-up Tottenham Hotspur. It’s fair to say this is a big one. We might only be nine days into the new season, but as both teams have designs on the Premier League title, this qualifies as a proper six-pointer. Sniff if you like, but there it is.City will be confident of making an early statement in their quest to join Huddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United as three-peat winners of the English top ision. As if sticking five past West Ham at their own gaff wasn’t enough. They’re currently on a 15-game winning streak in the league, and are on a four-match winning run against this evening’s opponents. They’ve beaten Tottenham seven times in their last nine visits. And Spurs have a dismal record against the top clubs of late: just seven points against the other members of the self-styled Big Six last year.On the flip side, that four-game winning streak of City’s is a league-only affair. It doesn’t include the Champions League quarter-final bedlam between the two sides last April, two matches that fair took the wind out of City’s continental sail, and briefly threatened to derail their Premier League campaign, as Pep’s men huffed and puffed to a one-goal win over the same opponents three days later. So Spurs are unlikely to feel too overawed, despite the overall picture.But they’ll need to perform a lot better than they did during those Christian-Eriksen-free minutes against Aston Villa last weekend. Can they raise their game and give the champions a fright? Or will City keep on keepin’ on? We’ll find out soon enough. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a51c752cdd62845d6c007dc76f8ae071b79fd08/0_61_2252_1351/master/2252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2277df1e0b12479a561efbffd7a9ef46","title":"southampton v liverpool everton v watford and more live clockwatch","story":"Here’s a roundup on today’s EFL action on Luke McLaughlin.

One bedroom is furnished entirely with pieces from the New York hotel room set seen in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again in which he reprises his character Sky. “I really needed to do the room up quickly and so I bought all of the furniture from that set after the film was finished. I call it the Mamma Mia! floor.”Occupying the second and third floors of a three-storey terrace, the property comprised a two-bedroom flat on the third floor and a one-bedroom on the second floor when Cooper bought it. Seeing the potential to extend into the eves of the roof, he enlisted E2 architects to create an upper floor open-plan loft-style kitchen-living space, adding reclaimed rustic timber joists in the ceiling and an exposed brick wall to contrast with the grey brick tiles in the sleek, modern white kitchen. A skylight punctuates the wood joists, flooding the room with natural light. “I’ve been slowly working my way down the building,” says Cooper, “buying different bits of it and turning it into a home.” The actor first stumbled across the property when he and his former flatmate James Corden were looking for places to buy. “The area had the same feel to it as Blackheath where I grew up, and I loved its proximity to Soho,” he says. “It’s so important to have a cosy nest to come back to, in among the chaos and madness of having a job where I travel so much. One of my favourite things now is to walk through Regent’s Park and get into the heart of the city. It’s a really nice, mind-clearing journey through greenery into the hustle and bustle.”A place to relax, the flat has also been a party pad in its time. “I actually have a letter framed on my wall from my next-door neighbour when she was much younger, which says, ‘Please, Mr Cooper, I have my Spelling B competition tomorrow morning and it’s now 5am and you’re still playing drum and bass.’”The home mixes modern design pieces, collected vintage furniture and an unusual number of lamps. “I have a kind of light fetish,” he admits. In the upper living area a record player from New Orleans sits on an old teak Danish sideboard and piles of photography books hold up a rickety glass coffee table that once belonged to a friend’s father, a scenic artist at the Royal Opera House.“He lived on a houseboat in Chelsea and that table reminds me of so many great times we had on the boat, like wonderful New Year’s Eve parties.” A rather sturdier dining table from Roche Bobois takes centre stage in the kitchen, with a set of Eames 1958 aluminium chairs.Prints of the Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers album cover and Kraftwerk’s 1975 Radio-Activity hang on the walls, the latter a gift from a friend for the opening night of the play Phèdre at the National Theatre, in which Dominic starred as Hippolytus opposite Helen Mirren.Downstairs, a figurative sculpture by his grandmother hides in a wall nook, and her sculpture of a ballerina swirling around in a snow globe is perched on the glass shelves in the guest room ensuite.“She sculpted the dancers along with other pieces,” he says. “I used to watch her make them in her conservatory when we lived in Blackheath, and remember her always being covered in clay, so I love having them around the place to remind me of her.” Her Ukiyo-e Japanese art prints, which she bought in the 80s at Liberty, now hang above an antique chest of drawers in one lilac-hued bedroom offset by a brown fabric feature wall that faces a painting of a female nude, another gift, this time from the artist Jonathan Yeo.A cherry maroon wall in an office-turned-guest bedroom provides a bold backdrop for a 60s fold-down bureau and shelves filled with artefacts, vintage cameras and, jokes Cooper, “all my OCD colour-coordinated books.” A bright red padded leather chair – one of two he acquired 15 years ago from the office of theatrical agent Pippa Markham, credited with helping Ian Dury’s acting career – sits under a midcentury glass and wood desk, yet another recycling gem from the set of Mamma Mia!At every turn there are smart colour touches and textures, such as the dark inky green palette in the ensuite bathroom that works a metal and glass industrial aesthetic. A bronze sculpture by his mother blends into the coppery tiled shower walls. “I chose those tiles because they reminded me of the stage in Waiting for Godot, a play I did years ago at drama school. We built this huge cube of rust,” he explains. “When I saw that tile it was exactly the same colour, and I thought it would look great.”There was never a grand interiors masterplan for Cooper’s home, but he likes how it’s worked out. “It’s been a progressive process. I’ve got to know the place and have added things along the way. I’ve loved buying little bits of furniture here and there over the years, and I think the more you do that and accumulate other things from different places, you add parts of your life into the building. It makes for a much more personal space, where each little corner has something to do with someone or somewhere you remember.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa7320506c0a41d5d973c85992429ab9caf4f3ee/13_0_1213_728/master/1213.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e74dd6d39d56b35c6fce4dfaf8a3a11a","title":"take on my kids fortnite romesh ranganathan","story":"Mastering Fortnite would make me the coolest dad, but I can’t even work out the controlsThe game Fortnite has just started its 10th season, and my children have become impossible to understand. They say things like: “There’s been a drop near the eye of the storm,” and “This guy using the Twistie skin is such a blatant noob.” They also seem to think my wife and I have some sort of contact with the makers of the game, as this morning my second son asked me if I could sort out the Fortnite servers. I said I would, and left the room to make a sandwich. When I returned, the servers had been fixed and my son thanked me. I accepted his gratitude, as my level of understanding is so minimal that for all I know all it needed was for me to make a sandwich.I have never worried about having my finger on the pulse, because I consume music and cinema voraciously, and assumed that meant I would know all of the things my kids were into, even if I didn’t like them. The other day I said to my son: “I’m taking ya missus, nah brother I’m joking,” because that is a song by Jay1, who I know kids love, and my son told me that a) that might have been impressive if I had done it four months ago, and b) what I was doing was obvious and pathetic. But I find Fortnite completely impenetrable, and I now have to listen to my kids talk about great Fortnite players with more affection than they do their parents. I constantly walk past their rooms to the sounds of, “Aw man Ninja 120 is the absolute best”, or “Alpha Bum posted up a video of him killing 12 enemies with just a crossbow!” I can feel the common ground between us disappearing.My kids are very different to how I remember being at their age with regards to interests. They are really keen for my wife and me to be across all this crap. I went into my eldest son’s room when he was in the middle of a game and asked him to talk me through it. He proceeded to give me an in-depth tutorial that consisted of him running around, building weird structures and shooting people, while asking me if I was getting it. I really wasn’t. And what’s frustrating is I’m a gamer, albeit a casual one. I’ll play anything Mario- or Zelda-related, but Fortnite is one step beyond me. I don’t get anything from it but motion sickness and an increased sense of anxiety about how violent future generations are going to be.He went on to YouTube and started showing me videos posted by the best players in the world, the likes of whom recently won shedloads of money in the Fortnite World Cup. I watched these videos of people running about shooting and drinking potion, and every now and again my son would say: “How sick was that move?” and I would nod while wondering how much longer I would have to watch before I could ask to stop, without hurting his feelings. I guess this is what it felt like when an earlier generation of kids started getting into punk or hip-hop. But that happened to teenagers. My kids aren’t even 10 yet.I am going to have to find a way into Fortnite. But I am now of the belief that this has to become an undercover mission, so that I can become good at it without looking like I’m trying. I am going to access it at work, train, and become incredible. Then I am going to enter one of their battles as DaddyKnowsBest and lay waste to them and their friends. I will unmask myself and wait for their adulation as they realise that I am the coolest dad in the country.The truth is, however, that I had a go the other night after they had gone to sleep and I couldn’t even figure out the bloody controls. I’ve decided that having a connection with my kids might not be worth the effort."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b926cacb1183668e927cf4cdc5beff6abaaf9555/0_187_1460_876/master/1460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea66dcecc1455447f2bc4baa83628500","title":"younger hotter boyfriend think his mother","story":"It’s not unusual to see older men dating more youthful, prettier women – so why are people so confused by my relationship? One fine Montréal fall morning, I sat at the kitchen table, writing, the cat fed and purring, the teapot still half full, in a sacred moment of flow, when the doorbell rang. I let my boyfriend answer it and eavesdropped from the kitchen.“Hello, I’m looking for the woman of the house.”Hopefully my Frenchman would dispatch him.“The woman of the house. The woman who lives here. She knows me.”“Vendeur du poisson. The woman who lives here. Can you get her for me?”Although we live in a Francophone neighbourhood, Fishman delivered these last lines in a slow and mocking English. He seemed insulted that his presence should be questioned. I could hear my usually calm Frenchman’s voice take on the particular irritation of a man who opens his front door to another man who refuses to tell him what he is doing there.“But what do you want?”“Look, the woman who lives here. The woman I guess would be your mother. Can you get her for me please?”Now, I am a little older than my fella. Seven years to be exact. Seven and a half to be exacter. We are not Harold and Maude. We are not even Brigitte and Macron. Could anyone realistically mistake me for his mother? Don’t get me wrong, his mother is very lovely and very pretty and, under different circumstances, I would be honoured to be mistaken for her. But she is also in her 60s, while I am in my 30s.The cogs of my brain smoked as I struggled to process the category error.I think that when Fishman – mid-50s, bearded, baseball-capped – first intruded upon me in the swelter of the summer he saw a woman in his dating bracket.This is not Fishman’s fault, bless his polycotton blend socks. He has, like many men in their 50s, spent his life being deeply misled by the telly, where male leads his age and older are paired with pretty, flitty wee fillies in their 20s and younger. This has skewed his sense of reality.It has skewed all of our senses of reality, to be honest. I remember watching the chemistry between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and thinking, “Woah, that’s weird, she’s too old for him.” But Fisher was 14 years younger than Ford. I was so used to seeing Harrison dripping in women a third of his age that a more demographically realistic romantic interest jarred.This is strange because if you stop looking at screens and look out of windows instead you notice that most people tend to date in and around their own age group. Beautiful 22-year-old women usually throw themselves at handsome 22-year-old men, not at dandies they picked up down the bingo. Decades-long age gaps are real and perfectly cool, and age is just a number, and love is love, and love is all you need etc, but such gaps are also not the norm. Yet, as a woman in her 30s, I can roundly attest that men in their 50s do not seem to know this.So Fishman gets to my door, and expects to find a woman in his general league. When the door is opened instead by a handsome young man in his 20s, it does not compute. Thus, I must be my boyfriend’s mother.Now, you might be thinking, what has handsome got to do with it? Is she just finding opportunities to boast about her sexy boyfriend? And yes I am, but, nonetheless, I think handsome is part of the equation. Because not only is my boyfriend a little younger than me, which is not the norm, he is also a little hotter than me, which is not de rigueur either. I know. It’s a cross I bear.When we first started dating, I thought I was just wearing my “I fancy you” glasses, which are very like beer googles except that you can’t take them off. But then I started to introduce the Frenchman to my friends, or to send the odd photo of us on a city break to my Irish girls WhatsApp group. The responses were less, “Aww, you guys are cute” and more “hot damn”. This gave me pause. Was everyone wearing my I fancy you glasses?After her first introduction to my Frenchman, my friend Alexa made a number of physical observations along the lines of: “But you didn’t tell me he was so… tall”, “But you didn’t tell me he was so… blond.” And I joked, “He is very good-looking, isn’t he? Maybe he’s just with me for my apartment.” “No offence,” said Alexa, “but if that man was gold-digging, he could sleep his way into a better apartment.” This was strangely comforting.It is evident that Fishman could not help but be confused, the poor lamb. I mean, take 20 seconds to think of a celebrity pairing – real or fictional, past or present – where the woman is more beautiful than the man. Easy, isn’t it? Harvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman. Beyoncé and Jay Z. Kirsten Dunst and that guy from Fargo. The romantic leads in every single Woody Allen film. It’s just too simple.Then try it in reverse. Twenty seconds. I’m counting. Whatcha got? Nothing? Me neither. So I Googled it and found my way to a chic listicle entitled, “Twenty-Five Smokin’ Hot Celebrities With Just Average-Looking Spouses” and was told that Christian Bale and Matt Damon are both married to less attractive women. I eagerly Googled their ostensibly homely honeys only to find that I’d been lied to and both wives are, disappointingly, very beautiful indeed.I’m not sure this trope can be dismissed by looking out of the window quite as easily. I think that very attractive women are more likely to date regular looking blokes than vice versa. Women are less shallow than men, you see. This is the only explanation I am interested in or will accept, and anyone coming at me with evolutionary psychology about women’s innate desire for resources and men’s innate desire for lithe yoga instructors will be put directly in the bin.(Wait – does this mean I’m shallow for dating a more attractive man? No, no. Not I. I’m so deep I don’t even see beauty.)On the doorstep, my Frenchman was out of patience. He told Fishman to wait and came to fetch me from my writing nest, from whence I made my finest “Don’t make me go out there” eyes, then reluctantly followed him out to the hall.“The woman of the house!” said Fishman.“Who’s this?” he said, gesturing to my Frenchman, “the security?”Yes, this is my son, the security. I birthed him when I was seven by way of a biological miracle and sent him directly to jujitsu camp in Paris, where he spent 25 years acquiring deadly martial arts skills and an impeccable French accent, before moving to Québec to protect me, his recently relocated Irish child-mother, from murderers, thieves, and door-to-door fish salesmen.I did not say this. Instead, I said, “That is my boyfriend.” But I am confident that my tone communicated “and your error, sir, in mistaking him for my son, has ensured that I will never, ever purchase any of your seafood.”Fishman curled his lips into a snarl. Then he circled, ed off my stoop, and cut his way through the crisp of the day.At first, I liked the story of Fishman thinking I was my boyfriend’s mother. I told it to everyone, laughing, in a “Can you believe it!” vein, and everyone obliged me by insisting that, no they could not believe it and isn’t it funny, and who could possibly make that mistake?My Frenchman, conversely, did not like the story one bit. He thinks Fishman was trying to provoke him by telling him to go get his mother and then asking me if he was the security. “Foo-king guy,” remains his main analysis of the situation, masking a depth of complex heterosexual man emotions.With time, I find I too like the tale of Fishman less, because it has made me sense the water in which we all swim in a way I didn’t before. When a fellow student at the art class my Frenchman and I attend remarked harmlessly, but with a note of surprise, “Oh, you two are together,” I parsed her meaning. After all, she’d sat right next to us for the last four still life sessions. We call each other “mon amour” and share all our brushes and paints. What did she think we were?There are plenty of metaphorical fish in the proverbial sea, but the expected patterns of how they should choose a mate are actually pretty limiting. I wonder how many women would never date a younger man, even if they wanted the same things from life, because of a subconscious awareness of social perception? I wonder how many men wouldn’t follow that delicious chemistry to a woman who lights them right up, because they feel that, looks-wise, they could do better?But fear not, my Frenchman and I will continue to swim bravely upstream to spawn, battling the current of social expectation, avoiding the anglers’ hooks of judgment, politely correcting other salmon who mistake us for Mama Fish and recently hatched fry. For feminism, you understand. It’s a tough job, and, admittedly, I am selfless, but if someone’s got to do it, why shouldn’t it be me?• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea0938b7af8606b4213e64bf839f711ae5515dd/0_83_2057_1234/master/2057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2942e4bf2407e9bf3831f7a792aacb7","title":"leonard bernstein japanese love letters hashimoto","story":"One was among the most brilliant composers and conductors of the 20th century, a sexagenarian who brought the world one of the great love stories of musical theatre. The other was a 26-year-old who worked in a Tokyo insurance company. Now, a newly revealed cache of letters shows that in the last decade of his life Leonard Bernstein embarked on a passionate relationship with a Japanese man.“I noticed that he was gazing upon me,” Kunihiko Hashimoto, now 66, said. It is hard to explain about his eyes. It was not to try to talk to me nor seduce me, just he was looking at me. It was irresistible.”Hashimoto’s role in Bernstein’s life had been almost completely overlooked until Mari Yoshihara, a Japanese-American academic, discovered some 350 letters at the Library of Congress in Washington. She found that they first met in 1979, when Hashimoto went backstage with a friend after a concert and ended up spending the night with Bernstein.The West Side Story composer was visiting Tokyo with the New York Philharmonic and when he left Hashimoto was devastated. The following day, he wrote to him: “After you left Japan, my mind became vacant, because the one night and afternoon that we had were like a beautiful dream.”Yoshihara, professor of American Studies at the University of Hawaii, said her “jaw dropped” when she first read the letters, having stumbled across them by chance in the library’s Bernstein collection.“They’ve got 1,700 boxes of some 400,000 items,” she said, “including manuscripts… It’s completely overwhelming. I was going through it and, by accident, came across these personal letters to Bernstein from two Japanese iniduals whose names I didn’t recognise.”Intrigued, she asked to see the rest of the correspondence: “It completely changed the course of my project.”Hashimoto’s letters  about 11 years until the summer of 1990, a few months before Bernstein’s death, aged 72. Yoshihara found that the Japanese man’s name appears only briefly in the most comprehensive Bernstein biography – as a business representative.“Beyond that, I couldn’t find anything about him,” she said. “He was working for an insurance company when he first met Bernstein. A few years after their relationship began, because Hashimoto was already an amateur actor, he auditioned for a major musical theatre company in Japan and became an actor. Bernstein’s manager later invited him to become the composer’s Japan representative ... Hashimoto played a crucial role in some of Bernstein’s major projects in his late career, including organising the Hiroshima peace concerts in 1985.”Their relationship went far beyond sexual intimacy. Hashimoto went on to work as a writer, director and producer in Australia and Japan, and his productions included a translation of Bernstein’s musical Candide.Bernstein, according to his West Side Story collaborator Arthur Laurents, was “a gay man who got married. He wasn’t conflicted about it at all. He was just gay.”After the death of his wife, actress Felicia Cohn Montealegre, in 1978, he had many lovers. Although Hashimoto was not the only object of Bernstein’s affections, the love was not unrequited, according to Yoshihara: “It was mutual. On two occasions Bernstein arranged to bring Hashimoto to Europe to spend time with him.”In one letter, Hashimoto wrote: “I have received the tenderest letter from you. I read it over and over again.”Describing the correspondence as “passionate, tender and sometimes heartbreaking”, Yoshihara said: “Hashimoto’s words exude every emotion of a young man who has fallen deeply in love.”The Japanese man was taken aback when he was told by Yoshihara that she had read his letters. “He was very shocked … He hadn’t even known that the letters were available for viewing at the Library of Congress,” she said. But she secured his trust once he realised that her forthcoming book, Dearest Lenny: Letters from Japan and the Making of the World Maestro (Oxford University Press, £19.99), is a scholarly study of Bernstein interwoven with the history, politics and economics of the 20th century.It will include Hashimoto’s letters, one of which reads: “I never forget that you asked me where we should live. Your question was where ‘we’ should live, wasn’t it?’ I would like to live with you. Even as a maid (but I am not good at cooking and sewing). Even as a secretary (but I cannot type quickly). Even as like a doll (but I have a mind) … I was born to meet you and to be with you.”Elsewhere, he wrote: “The letters you wrote to me … the pictures I took in Munich, Positano, Amsterdam, and the presents you gave me … I have kept all of them and locked them in a briefcase.”Yoshihara’s book, which is to be published on 2 September in the US and 28 November in the UK, also includes previously unpublished missives from a Japanese woman, also held in the Library of Congress: Kazuko Amano began writing fan letters to Bernstein in 1947 and became a close family friend over more than four decades.

Raised in Hertfordshire, she studied music and visual arts at the University of Brighton and worked as a nursery school teacher for four years before committing to music full-time. A rich seam of theatricality was woven into her songwriting from the start, taking shape in elaborate outfits and intense stage performances. Three of her four Bat for Lashes albums to date, including 2006 debut Fur and Gold, have been nominated for the Mercury prize (Khan also released an album via her side project Sexwitch in 2015). Her latest album, Lost Girls, comes out next month.Was there an overarching concept?I was developing a script for a film called The Lost Girls. It was heavily influenced by 80s children’s films and vampire films, many set in Portland and California. But as the songs progressed, I felt like I was writing the film soundtrack. Music does tend to overtake film ideas, as it comes out much more easily.Which 80s films did you have in mind?The Lost Boys, obviously, is a close link, and seeing LA’s hazy sunsets is making me think of films like ET and The Goonies. Moving to LA, I’ve basically been plonked inside the sets of all the films I loved as a kid.What switched you on to music?I saw Michael Jackson on his Bad tour when I was nine, with my mum, and I remember his Thriller video coming out – that was really exciting. And later on, seeing how pop musicians like Kate Bush and David Bowie were using the more theatrical aspects of music had a big influence on me. At art college, the way we approached music was very closely linked with visual art and performance. With my first band I said, “I want us to make headdresses”, and so we’d go down to the haberdashery and buy a bunch of sequins and old lady broaches in antique shops. It was a hodgepodge and it probably didn’t even make sense, but I was trying to figure out how we were going to stand out on stage and express ourselves in a playful way.What’s been the most surreal experience of your career so far?It’s always surreal when people I love come to shows, like Björk turning up to one of my first big shows in London, or seeing Tilda Swinton in the audience. Or supporting Radiohead on tour – as a teenager I was listening to The Bends every day on the train to school, and then 10 years later I’m supporting them around Europe. It’s also surreal when I make a video based on something I’ve had in my imagination for a really long time, and then I find myself stepping into my own dream. Who gets to do that?Have you acclimatised to California?I do love LA for its landscapes and light, and the optimism and ambition of the people, but being English I’m very aware that I probably couldn’t exist there for a long time. I miss the seasons, the grittiness and the English sense of humour. And part of the reality in America is having no health insurance. And heat that melts the pavements and so much traffic and smog. But there’s no perfect place.By temperament, do you lean towards sunny Californian optimism or British gloom?I go between the two. I think this album is demonstrating a side of me that’s happy and loves to dance, laugh and be silly – that’s a big part of who I am. I spent a long time trawling the depths and the darkness in my music. But being in LA, maybe it has liberated that side of me that is more fun.Do you keep up with the news?I’m obviously aware of things that are happening, but I don’t give a lot of time and energy to it, because it’s become such a big ball of knots. We used to think that we could rely on things we saw in the news to be real, but at the moment everything’s being exposed as lies and no one seems to really know what’s going on. It adds a lot to my anxiety and confusion, so I think my time is much better spent creating work that is quite positive and sublimating all these worries into something a bit more productive.You’re approaching your 40s. How do you feel about it?There’s a side of me that can’t believe I’m going to be 40, because I feel so young, and because what I do tethers me to a part of my psyche that’s full of childlike wonder. There’s a sadness about accepting that you’re getting older, and the way society views age doesn’t help. But when I think about all the people I have admired, film-makers and writers, they only get better with age. For me, I feel doors are only opening, not closing.Lost Girls is released via AWAL on 6 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7971d49c05634fccd9cafc49023f1e4a218feb84/0_0_4330_2887/master/4330.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8557f1dfec95922e0b53bf2d76308f0 480w","title":"labour to give councils power to seize boarded up shops","story":"Abandoned buildings could be turned into community centres in push to revive high streetsLabour will allow councils to seize abandoned shops to give them a new lease of life as cooperatives or community centres, a policy designed to revive struggling high streets.Jeremy Corbyn is expected to announce the shake-up on a visit to a high street in Bolton on Saturday, calling the sight of boarded-up shops a “symptom of economic decay” which is lowering living standards.Under the Labour proposals, local authorities could offer properties which had been vacant for 12 months to startups, cooperative businesses and community projects.“Boarded-up shops are a symptom of economic decay under the Conservatives and a sorry symbol of the malign neglect so many communities have suffered,” Corbyn will say.“Once-thriving high streets are becoming ghost streets. Labour has a radical plan to revive Britain’s struggling high streets by turning the blight of empty shops into the heart of the high street, with thousands of new businesses and projects getting the chance to fulfil their potential.”Initiatives to regenerate high streets were a key policy pledge at Labour’s party conference and are understood to be a significant part of the party’s strategy in less-affluent towns, particularly those in the Midlands and north-east targeted by the Conservatives after the Brexit vote.The party’s five-point plan for reviving the high street includes banning ATM charges and action to dissuade bank branch and post office closures, as well as free bus travel for under-25s and a review of the business rates system.The shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said: “Under this government, our high streets have suffered a retail apocalypse. High-street closures are at a historic high, leaving too many of our once thriving towns abandoned and awash with boarded-up shop fronts.“Labour’s radical plan will turn around the mess that the Tories have created and will give local authorities the power to make our high streets the pride of our communities that they once were.”Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said more action needed to be taken to stop shops from closing down, rather than just repurposing abandoned buildings.“Small businesses on our high streets are under pressure like never before, with costs rising, employment burdens weighing heavy and political uncertainty – and rows of boarded-up shops do not make for a healthy or inspiring town centre,” he said.“While finding new ways to reopen closed shops is positive, this is after the fact they have shut. Sustainable, erse and thriving high streets rest on good local investment to make the public realm more attractive, and stopping rents and rates bills becoming unaffordable for businesses in the first place.”The communities minister, Jake Berry, dismissed the proposal, alleging that Labour’s tax policies would cause more businesses to leave high streets. “Jeremy Corbyn would wreck the economy, tax small businesses and scare off the investment needed to help our high streets, meaning more boarded-up shops and fewer jobs,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ca98b7e340a28ba9da02b97c84181845ffb2b6/483_0_3454_2073/master/3454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8a28f18489f7159273c0b0968afd9cf","title":"sajid javid refuses to rule out stamp duty reversal so seller pays","story":"‘I’m a low-tax guy’ says chancellor as he reveals he is considering policy changes The chancellor has refused to rule out reversing stamp duty so it is paid by the seller, rather than the buyer.In an interview with the Times, Sajid Javid indicated he was willing to consider the policy, which was said to have been favoured by Boris Johnson during the Tory leadership campaign, among others.Asked about the proposal, Javid told the paper: “I’m looking at various options. I’m a low-tax guy. I want to see simpler taxes.”The Tory chancellor said he wanted to see “simpler” taxes, while suggesting the lowest paid would be first in line for any cuts. Asked about taxes for higher earners, he said: “Wait and see for the budget ... but it wouldn’t be any surprise that I think taxes should be efficient.“We want to set them at a rate where we are trying to maximise revenue, and that doesn’t always mean that you have the highest tax rate possible. Generally, I want to see lower taxes, but at a level that is going to pay for the public services.”He said the Treasury would consider whether to make changes to the fiscal rules including eliminating the deficit by the middle of the next decade before he delivered the budget – but that he had not yet decided whether to hold it before 31 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b68d24d475107acdc2a79b7094eae41a97f5b970/0_111_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e28e186303258c2b5f3d048c9c3aa3e","title":"sajid javid announces 600m of new infrastructure spending","story":"Chancellor says spending could ‘unlock’ construction of up to 50,000 homes in London, south-east and East AngliaSajid Javid has announced more than £600m of new infrastructure spending that will potentially support the construction of up to 50,000 homes in London, the south-east and east of England.The funding, which will come from the Housing Infrastructure Fund (HIF) that Javid launched in July 2017 when he was secretary of state for communities and local government, will go towards the building of roads, rail links, schools and other infrastructure projects.Almost £220m will be spent in Essex on a bypass and a new train station to the north of Chelmsford, which could support 14,000 new homes. Another £100m will be spent on a new road near Colchester that could lead to the construction of 7,500 homes.London will receive around £240m for two schemes in Enfield and the east of the capital, while just under £70m will be spent in central Bedfordshire to build a new secondary school and transport infrastructure.The chancellor said: “I want to see more homes built in the places people want to live, so more people realise the dream of homeownership.“But we need the roads, rail links, and schools to support the families living in those homes, which is why I set up a fund to put in place the infrastructure to unlock new homes in these areas.”The government’s £5.5bn housing fund has already allocated more than £1.6bn on 243 projects across the country, including rail links in Cumbria and transport infrastructure in Devon and Cornwall.London’s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the funding, tweeting: “I’m delighted we have secured funding for more frequent Overground services, station upgrades and other infrastructure to support growth in Enfield, Canada Water, New Bermondsey and Deptford – unlocking 21,000 homes that Londoners so desperately need.”The announcement will further fuel rumours that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is planning a blitz of public spending in the runup to a general election. But in an interview with the Times, Javid said “that when it comes to spending, you’ve got to pick priorities. Not everything can be a priority.”However, the chancellor’s commitment to infrastructure projects means that further projects are likely to unveiled in the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4fb5a94a318bf6c3c0e092f63f33de95bcc4f3b/0_719_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81c8106ce0d122951973090ffc569505","title":"students hired by gambling apps to entice peers to bet","story":"Students at prestigious UK universities are being recruited to promote betting apps on campus and, in some cases, are handing out free cash to entice others to gamble.An investigation by the Observer has found that students are being headhunted by marketing agencies that claim they are working on behalf of betting companies.At the University of Manchester, student promoters encouraged peers to take advantage of “free bets” on two gambling apps, Kwiff and BetBull, by handing out £5 notes around campus and other meeting places.Critics have condemned the marketing agencies for the “unscrupulous” ploy of targeting impressionable young people, and the National Union of Students raised concerns over the “deplorable tactics”. The makers of the apps, who contract the marketing agencies to promote their products, have denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, the scheme.Students can reportedly earn up to £12 for every person they sign up. Recruitment is often done by sharing links on social media but some students employ face-to-face marketing.It is unclear if handing out cash or gifts is encouraged by the marketing agencies, or if some students have taken the matter into their own hands, but one student promoter said they were given little guidance on accepting the job. The undergraduate said: “The goal is to get people to download the app and make a bet... it’s pretty much up to us.”It also denied any knowledge of marketing companies handing out gifts on its behalf. “This would be considered a breach of contract and would lead to immediate termination of an affiliate contract.”BetBull said that the flyer with its logo on being given out at universities was unauthorised. “Nobody at BetBull was aware of, or sanctioned, its production or distribution. Betbull does not tolerate or condone this practice – we take our marketing compliance obligations extremely seriously and ensure that our marketing affiliates are fully and regularly trained on these compliance requirements. We take all available measures to prevent misuse of our branding and have launched a full investigation into this matter.”The NUS commissioned a report into students and gambling at the end of last year and found that some undergraduates were gambling their student loan to afford increased living costs.The University of Manchester declined to comment other than saying it hadn’t had anything to do with the gambling app jobs.

Everybody thinks they are the best in the race. That’s how sprints work and that’s how it’s got to be. And I want to win.”The 23-year-old proved she was world class in Berlin last year, clocking world-leading times of 10.85sec and 21.89 to break her own national records, as she won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay. However, she knows she will have her work cut out on Sunday when she headlines the Birmingham Diamond League in a 200m that oozes extreme class and guile.When she looks around on the starting blocks she will see a who’s who of sprinting: Dafne Schippers, the world champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, a double Olympic gold medallist and seven-times world champion Blessing Okagbare and Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who have run the second and third fastest times in the world this year. There will also be a host of other top sprinters who are likely to be in the world championship finals in Doha next month.But the message from Asher-Smith is clear: bring it on. “You can’t be daunted by anybody,” she says. “There’s nobody in track and field who is infallible or unable to be beaten.”Her confidence is understandable. Asher-Smith has run under 11 seconds for the 100m three times this season and won two of her three Diamond League races over 200m, and she intends to double up in Doha. She also has happy memories of Birmingham, where she ran a personal best and nearly took down the legendary Allyson Felix as a teenager in 2015.“I love racing here,” she says. “One of my favourite races ever was in Birmingham when I first raced against Allyson and I ran a massive PB out of nowhere of 22.30sec. I was so dead I threw up on Ricky Simms’ shoes afterwards! It was right next to the media tent and I said to him: ‘How am I going to do media?’ And he said: ‘You’ll be fine!’“So I remember running out my skin here before and, obviously, I got rewarded,” she adds. “So I’m coming to run out my skin again. I’m naturally quite a chilled and quiet person but whenever I step on to the track, I’m fiercely competitive and every time I step on the line, I’m here to win.“I love running in the UK and I’m really happy I get to run in the UK late in the season and closer to the world championships. It’s not quite a final goodbye for the worlds but it’s as close as we can get.”And she is not even scared by the thought of facing someone as great as Fraser-Pryce, who ran an astonishing 10.73 earlier this season for 100m after coming back from pregnancy.“It actually makes me focus more,” she says. “I can’t be daunted by somebody else’s thing. If they want to break the world record, there’s nothing I can do to control it. All I can do is control my own performances. I am looking to do the best I can and if it comes in a nice glittery form in Doha then I will be really happy but even if it doesn’t and I run fast times I will have to take it.”Event organisers have confirmed that more than 60 global medallists – including 10 reigning Olympic champions, two Paralympic champions and 13 reigning world champions – will compete at the Alexander Stadium.Among them will be Christian Coleman, the fastest man in the world this year with a time of 9.81sec, who faces the Commonwealth champion Akani Simbine, triple Olympic medallist Andre De Grasse and the former European champion Adam Gemili. In the 400m, the European champion Matt Hudson-Smith returns to action in his local stadium for the men’s 400m – his first race since September 2018.British eyes will also be on the long jump clash between Katarina Johnson-Thompson and her great heptathlon rival Nafi Thiam. Both women are focusing more on Doha, and are not expected to challenge the event specialists for victory. However, Johnson-Thompson, who has a personal best of 6.93m, intends to leave her mark, by inching somewhere closer to her best.“It’s definitely important,” explained Johnson-Thompson. “It’s one of my strongest events but I haven’t been at the level which I’d like recently. So if I can produce a big jump, it would give me confidence.”Thiam, meanwhile, is playing down their rivalry. “It’s great that Katarina is here because we know each other and I’m used to competing with her, but it’s a long jump competition,” she said. “We’re not in a heptathlon, so I don’t think winning is the point here. I just want to see where I am. In Doha it will be something else but here, I’m not putting pressure on myself to win. But I think it’s going to be very interesting in Doha.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a25f6018fc93bf61494eef32fcd079e1e2c629e7/0_0_5316_3189/master/5316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=903c27d1dc56d39f09c18b0e82566d09","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia second test day four live","story":"27th over: England 78-4 (Buttler 4, Stokes 8) England’s batting heroes of the World Cup final face off Cummins, pawing the ground at the top of his mark. They play out another maiden. 25th over: England 78-4 (Buttler 4, Stokes 8) As late afternoon sun settles over Lord’s, Stokes attempts thekind of shot you might buy in a joke shop - but escapes, somehow, unscathed. And news - Steve Smith has not broken his arm and will be fit to bat tomorrow. 24th over: England 76-4 (Buttler 3, Stokes 7)Sweet Lord, someone explain the review system to Australia again. They don’t review an lbw shout off Lyon once more, and a DRS replay shows Stokes, then on six, would have been heading back to the pavilion. 23rd over: England 75-4 (Buttler 3, Stokes 6) A maiden from Siddle Here’s my hot take for the OBO, writes Sebastian Lloyd - Buttler’s out of nick, replace him with Curran in the role of a batsman who can bowl a few overs. More reliable, more useful. Hopefully this means Jos gets a 60 ball hundred.That is some jinx! 22nd over: England 75-4 (Buttler 3, Stokes 6) Just a leg bye off the over, and a flurry of emails about Joe Denly, kind but questioning.If only all the England batsmen followed Denly’s example and improved their Test average in both innings, they’d have no problems in this match, writes Geoff Wignall. On the other hand, after a single half century in 10 innings can should he be perservered with? Dave Adams asks for perspective: Hope the selectors judge Denly’s contributions in context. Scores of 30 and 26 might be underwhelming, but they were the hardest of hard runs - helping England to partially rebuild in both innings. 21st over: England 74-4 (Buttler 3, Stokes 6) Don’t forget we’ll be playing till seven tonight weather permitting... anyway, Buttler is off the mark with a tender shot through midwicket. Some rebuilding needed with some urgency. And we see Smith on the balcony, back from the hospital and somewhat dazed, but ok. An absolute cracker from Siddle that rears and spits and Burns can’t take hjs bat away in time. 20th over: England 64-3 (Burns 29, Stokes 6) With two left-handers at the crease, Paine whistles up for Lyon once again. And what an over he pulls out of the bag, having Stokes prodding and poking, until off the final ball Stokes goes forward and edges to first slip where Warner.... drops him. 19th over: England 64-3 (Burns 28, Stokes 0) Stokes leapfrogs Buttler up the order and is rewarded by a leave-aloner from Siddle. Another bright start from Denly, but no cigar. The ball before he was out, he’d sent Siddle to the boundary with a most gorgeous whip through mid-wicket. But that was then. Aw shucks, Denly drives straight back to Siddle who with soft hands grabs the ball in the follow through.18th over: England 56-2 (Burns 27, Denly 19) Hazlewood is back and Denly bears the brunt, fishing inelegantly at one that was wide enough for Moses to consider parting, before pulling one just short of deep square.  Lots more thoughtful emails, more than I can publish, for which apologies. First Damien Edgar from Victoria.I would say that, from the perspective of most Australian cricket fans and (I would guess) players, our perspective on seeing players get hit, particularly around the head, fundamentally changed following the death of Phil Hughes. When I’m watching cricket now and someone gets hit on the head, it doesn’t matter who he plays for, I feel physically sick, and that feeling lingers beyond finding out that the player is OK. And I don’t think that I am alone in this. And because the death of Phil Hughes had such a massive impact on the Australian sporting psyche, I think that we imagined that it would have had a similar impact throughout the world. There have been a few occasions since then when Australian fast bowlers have hit players on the head and they have immediately been at the player’s side to see if he is OK. From my perspective, it beggars belief that you would do anything different. Unless Archer was genuinely shaken and upset, in which case the appropriate response of his teammates is to actually see if he’s OK and put an arm around his shoulder and comfort him if he is not (or even if he says he is). It is not going over to him and sharing a joke and a giggle with him, while the opposing batsman is still being looked over by medical staff. And it is not clear that he was OK at this time – it can take hours and sometimes days for the side effects of head and brain injuries to present, let alone a couple of minutes. Bringing up Lillee and Thommo as some sort of rebuttal is callous and redundant – we no longer live in that world.17th over: England 54-2 (Burns 26, Denly 18) Siddle drifts wide of leg stump and the ball flies past Paine and down for four byes. I hear a shout from the other room and City have gone one-up against Tottenham - which can’t be true otherwise the new footall season is happening at the same time as the second Ashes Test. That would be ridiculous. Denly edges Siddle through the slips for four and a look of intense irritation passes over Siddle’s face. Stephen Davenport has an answer for Andrew Cosgrove’s musings on helmets. ..there is one way to protect that spot - get it out of the way of a bouncer. It’s a legitimate delivery, and I don’t recall any of this hue and cry when, for example, Malcolm Marshall was unapologetically picking bits of Mike Gatting’s nasal bone out of the ball. Then again, back then we didn’t have the raucous bear-pit that is Twitter. 16th over: England 46-2 (Burns 26, Denly 14) From the sublime to the ridiculous in two shots. First Joe Denly frolics down the pitch to lift Lyon over mid on for four glorious runs. Then he and Burns get in a right fix running between the wickets as Burns has his head in the clouds. Still, they’re still there, and that’s drinks. 15th over: England 41-2 (Burns 26, Denly 9) Summat simple from Peter Siddle. 14th over: England 39-2 (Burns 26, Denly 9) Rory Burns somehow survives an over from Nathan Lyon in which he would have been out lbw had Australia reviewed, and then plays a terrible slog-sweep that is heading for Neptune before falling back down but away from the Australian fielders. HE does manage a nice square cut too, to be fair. 13th over: England 30-2 (Burns 18, Denly 8) Denly is DROPPED by David Warner at first slip off Peter Siddle. He fends and Warner overbalances as he goes for the catch and the ball tips out of his fingertips. A lucky, lucky, lucky escape. 12th over: England 27-2 (Burns 18, Denly 6) Tim Pine goes for a double change, as Nathan Lyon replaces Hazlewood at the Nursery End. Burns, awkward, unconventional Burns, rouses the crowd with a boundary, a cut. David Hinde has not time for sentiment or sacred cows. He’s straight to the point, and it is hardcore. Hi Tanya. Hi DavidSo, can we now maybe confront the elephant in the room. “Joe Root is the only one of the big 4 not averaging over 50”. Err. There is no big 4. It’s a big 3. There have been and currently are countless batsmen whose career averages are higher than Root’s. But not one of them is english. There are 2 issues here. The inability of an english batsman to sustain an average over 50. And the complete blindness of cricket journalists to the state of the averages of the latest hyped-up english batsman. This issue is ancient. It goes back 4 decades. But no one wants to discuss it. And if Moeen needs a break from all forms of cricket, what about Joe Root? 11th over: England 23-2 (Burns 13, Denly 6) Cummins is sent for a brief period of pasture and Siddle is summoned up for the cause. It’s a simple acceleration process - and a simple delivery stride, no angles, nothing tricksy. No great speed either, but he’s a master of his art, as anyone at Essex could testify. Anyway, he starts with a maiden. 10th over: England 23-2 (Burns 13, Denly 6) Denly gets hit in the guts at high speed by Hazlewood. We see his mouth open and his eyes screw up in slow motion. That hurt. He escapes the danger end by tucking the ball down to long leg, though respite is short as Burns takes a single off the next ball.9th over: England 20-2 (Burns 12, Denly 4) Burns fiddles and twists - yes there are four slips behind you Rory. But he ducks a short one then knocks Cummins down to deep square leg for a couple more. At near parity with a just day to go, every run must have a value more than itself. Rr+3?8th over: England 18-2 (Burns 10, Denly 4) Hazlewood,, ears signalling east and west as he runs in, keeping it tight, but Burns manages a run, a pull to deep square. It’ll be a full house tomorrow I wager. Cheap tickets for kids in the school holidays Lord’s?7th over: England 17-2 (Burns 9, Denly 4) Cummins is bowling with fire here, but Burns and Denly survive. Denly even hits four, though without any conviction. Still, Gower has some kind words: “He’s got a good rhythm to him.”What an interesting situation this match is in writes Andrew Cosgrove. At tea, Sky was talking about how Smith wasn’t wearing a helmet with the new extra neck protection. But I don’t think that would have helped him, the ball looked like it hit him lower, and further forward. I don’t see how you can protect that spot without restricting head movement too much. 6th over: England 11-2 (Burns 7, Denly 0) Hazlewood has a plan for Burns. The plan is to bounce him. He nearly has his man, with an angry short ball that has Burns in a terrible tangle, arms up by his ears, chest facing the bowler. 5th over: England 9-2 (Burns 7, Denly 0) Who would you choose to face a hat-trick ball from Pat Cummins? Joe Denly is the man at the top of your pack. He survives, hit high, too high, on the pad. Cummins finishes the over by running through him. What an over. England look like a boiled egg with cracks. A golden duck for Joe Root. He prods at the ball and feathers behind to Paine. Cummins is on a hat-trick...A leading edge from a bouncer, that squares Roy up, sends the ball high and is well caught by Cummins running backwards. One thing - I think the hands were ok.4th over: England 9-0 (Burns 7, Roy 2) Jason - no! Those HARD HANDS push forward at Hazlewood and the ball falls a foot or so short of second slip. A nudge off the hip takes him out of the danger end. Plenty more emails on ArcherSmith:Simon Horbury has dug out a quote from the 1970s You might like this quote from a fast bowler:“I enjoy hitting a batsman more than getting him out. I like to see blood on the pitch.”Some bloke call Jeff Thomson...think he played for Engl...oops Aussie wasn’t he? 3rd over: England 8-0 (Burns 7, Roy 1) Roy is watchful, careful, all the fuls just making sure he’s not in any way reck2nd over: England 7-0 (Burns 7, Roy 0) Burns knocks Hazlewood through the off-side and three Aussies give chase, but it beats them all. Then he leaves a short ball in the style of Smith - dropping his hands low, but without the swat.1st over: England 1-0 (Burns 1, Roy 0) A tight over from Cummins to start the session - a crucial one for the match and a important one for Roy - who has already been dismissed by some as not good enough for Test cricket. Steve Smith is not on the field. TMS have some details on his injury: A compression bandage was put on his left arm on the field of play, he took a pain killer and the arm was iced in the dressing room prior to him returning to the field. He is now being assessed. No mention of the neck -so I assume all is ok. Roy and Burns are on the field and Cummins has the ball. Let’s go!And in the green corner:For my money, there’s been too much sanctimonious guff on Twitter regarding Archer’s reaction to hitting Smith. Would Jeff Thomson or Dennis Lillie have rushed to check on a batsmen’s well being having just hit them on? I don’t think so. Nor would Fred Truman, Andy Roberts, Micheal Holding or any fast bowler worth their salt. and from Ed Smyth:I don’t play at international level, and don’t play cricket other than casually, but I play hockey at a very high level. I play in goal, and in the course of that have injured or hurt people (by accident) - I know that immediately after I’ve been walked away by team mates who have done everything they can to make me smilelaugh because it’s that or let me feel guilty for something that crushes me, but they know I need to stay in game mode for the rest of the match. It’s not laughing at the injury, it’s laughing to avoid that stressed melt down.No idea if this explanation will satisfy the baying hordes, but Archer’s reaction makes sense.Oliver Atkinson has some all-round advice . After the previous email you mentioned about the reaction to Archer on twitter I searched his name on there. Lots of Aussies calling him “scum” and a “dog”. Not a good day for cricket fans showing their class this. Yes, I’m not sure twitter is a place of nuance on such things. All sorts of ugly things can rear their heads. Right: So from the beginning. As a German who had an Australian girlfriend for some time, I became a fan of cricket. She told me that it was played by gentleman. It can no longer be called so. Seeing Mr Archer laugh and joke as a man lay perhaps out of consciousness was a horrible thing to see more even than the replays of the sickening blow to the head that Mr Smith received.An article I read had a title like “how do England get this man out?”. It seems that they can’t, but resort to violent, dangerous bowling to incapacitated him instead. Are there sanctions for this form of behaviour, not trying to get an opponent out but trying to hurt and maim them? And then Malcolm Lamb: So you Poms can’t bowl the man out fair and square so resort to trying to kill him. As for laughing at his discomfiture after being hit - twice - that’s well beyond the pale. Add the booing from sections of the crowd and…this is what it’s come to. I might add that Smith turned a blind eye to what Warner and Bancroft were scheming - but he wasn’t the instigator of the cheating. That’s down to Warner and he’s getting his just desserts. Time to give Smith a break wouldn’t you say? Know many other batsman that can play as courageously as that? You could probably count them on one finger. What a session! Time for a quick cuppa and I’ll be back to go through all those emails, I promise. Meanwhile, arise Steve Smith. Whatever his past misdeeds, he’s been magnificent, courageous and the spine of his team.Cummins has a swing and gloves the ball behind. The England lead is just eight runs. Stuart Broad takes his fourth wicket of the innings.94th over: Australia 250-9 (Hazlewood 1 , Cummins 20) There’s something calming about Jack Leach. He’s a cup of tea after a bad day - and there’s not much better than that. The wicket, incidentally, came off the first ball of his spell. Clipping the middle of leg stump - Lyon reviewed but I’m not really sure why. The ball hit him on the front pad fairly middlingly. And that is Leach’s first wicket in a home Test!93rd over: Australia 246-8 (Lyon 6 , Cummins 20) Lovely by Lyon off Broad, on the up and through the covers for a handy three. Then Cummins drives and the ball falls just short of Root at firsts slipMy take on Archer’s giggling, before I hit the emails ...as someone who doesn’t play sport to any kind of level, I don’t understand not going to check if Smith was ok. But the giggling I can understand as a kind of nervous reaction - like you might have if someone told you something terrible.92nd over: Australia 243-8 (Lyon 3 , Cummins 20) Woakes wobbles the seam down and Cummins nudges him for four between slips. Frustration is just starting to show in Joe Root’s face - after the high drama, Australia are kicking the can towards parity. 91st over: Australia 238-8 (Lyon 2 , Cummins 16) Broad keeps it tight again, in an older brother kind of way as Lyon and Cummins tick off a few precious runs. Lisa Goldacre’s email pops in my inbox: Interesting email you have chosen to select. You might want to check the temperature on Twitter. Very different view of the giggling.... not cool at all Lisa I’ll go through them all at tea I promise.90th over: Australia 235-8 (Lyon 0 , Cummins 15) And amidst the drama, Australia now trail by only 23 - incidentally my lucky number. Woakes keeps it steady - I think everyone is holding on for arctic roll and a brew now.We’ve had this discussion about extra protection on helmets before on the OBO. You could have a modern equivalent of what used to be called an aventail on Persian-style helmets. Think Chris Gayle’s shade for the back of his neck, but in a stouter material.meanwhile Stephen Morley shakes his head in despairI am ashamed to be English hearing the English Lords mob booing Smith after he returns to the field.Has the country sunk to such lows even in cricket now?  I hear you Stephen. I filed something saying how great Lord’s was this morning - but that made me feel sick.

In a co-working space in Soho, the 39-year-old founder and CEO of Realeyes, an “emotion AI” startup which uses eye-tracking and facial expression to analyse mood, scrolls through a list of 20 festive ads from 2018. He settles on The Boy and the Piano, the offering from John Lewis that tells the life story of Elton John backwards, from megastardom to the gift of a piano from his parents as a child, accompanied by his timeless heartstring-puller Your Song. The ad was well received, but Jäätma is clearly unconvinced.He hits play, and the ad starts, but this time two lines – one grey (negative reactions), the other red (positive) – are traced across the action. These follow the second-by-second responses of a 200-person sample audience who watched the ad and allowed Realeyes to record them through the camera of their computer or smartphone. Realeyes then used its AI technology to analyse each inidual’s facial expression and body language. The company did this with all of Jäätma’s list of 20 Christmas ads from 2018, watching 4,000 people, before rating each commercial for attention, emotion, sentiment and finally giving it a mark out of 10.What is wrong with The Boy and the Piano, then? “So these are the metrics we measure: are you happy? Confused? Sad? Disgusted?” explains Jäätma, as the video plays. “If you look at the grey line, the negative emotions, you see that the UK audience is not that excited about the Elton John parts. The negativity goes up, people are tired about this promotion of the celebrity, they have had enough of this Elton John stuff.” Only when Elton as a child makes an appearance is there a spike of red. “Now when it goes into family and kids and it’s not the celebrity any more,” Jäätma goes on, “that’s where the positivity goes up.”Realeyes assigned the John Lewis commercial a score of 7.8 out of 10, placing it 12th out of the 20 Christmas ads they tested. It was rated fifth out of the retailer’s eight Christmas commercials since 2011. “So we concluded that this ad… the kid was the star,” says Jäätma. “It would have been better without Elton John almost. Or at least shorter.” The ad ran at 2min 20sec – “way too long. You can only put that on TV, no one’s going to watch that online.”This is clearly a big deal for John Lewis: their Christmas campaign is by far the most important of the year. But what difference does it make to us? Quite a lot, potentially, argues Jäätma. Realeyes was founded in 2007 with the goal of teaching computers how we feel. “There’s obviously this whole big debate about: is AI going to come and kill us or is it going to come and help us?” says Jäätma, an Estonian who started Realeyes with two friends while doing an MBA at the University of Oxford. “Right now, AI is like this big brain that is very intelligent and knows everything, but what we say is that it misses a heart. What we want to build into the AI is emotional understanding and consciousness. So the better we make it, the more likelihood that all this AI stuff will actually be good for humanity and not the other way around.”Jäätma and his partners – another Estonian, Martin Salo, and an Azerbaijani, Elnar Hajiyev, who work on the technical side – decided initially to focus on advertising because, they felt, it would be the quickest path to grow and make money. And, over a decade, they have created a database that they think is the richest and most sophisticated in the world. It is made up of 420m frames of people watching video on their devices (all have given their permission to be captured). These images are then labelled by seven different people, based on the American psychologist Paul Ekman’s list of basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. Realeyes has gone to efforts to make the training algorithm culturally sensitive, by having Europeans tag Europeans or Asians annotate Asians, but for Jäätma, the beauty of Ekman’s theory, which dates from the early 1970s, is that the basic emotions are expressed the same way whether the subject is from Japan or Madagascar.Realeyes is doing well. It now has a staff of 78 – including scientists and engineers in Budapest, with smaller sales and customer support teams in London and New York – and clients that include Coca-Cola and Mars. It has raised nearly £30m from investors, including £9.5m in the latest round, much of it from NTT, the Japanese telecoms company. And while its focus at the moment is advertising and entertainment, its aspirations are clearly much greater: education and healthcare are on Jäätma’s list of “86 new projects” (he’s serious). In fact, Realeyes believes that it won’t be long before emotion AI is a feature of almost every area of our lives.“AI is going to be the next industrial revolution,” Jäätma predicts. “So it’s going to have a huge impact on all industries. And emotion AI is going to be a core part of all AI, so we want to be at the forefront of when that happens and to have the right impact on that as well.”“The right impact” is a pertinent phrase. There are obvious advantages to our machines being more sensitive to our needs. It should mean a better, more intuitive service, less time wasted. Also, probably a billion things we haven’t thought of yet. One of Jäätma’s dreams is that soon emotion AI will be able to alert us when, for example, we are experiencing depression and encourage us to seek help.“Even today we spend more time with our phone than with our mothers or any other family member, so they just know and see you more than anything else,” he says. “And the technology is also getting to a place where you can get these facial and vocal reactions, which can be very early cues if you are too stressed for too long. If you can pick those signals up early, you can do something about it.”But emotion AI raises concerns, too. Do we really want our emotions to be machine-readable? How can we know that this data will be used in a way that will benefit citizens? Would we be happy for our employers to profile us at work, and perhaps make judgments on our stress management and overall competence? What about insurance companies using data accrued on our bodies and emotional state?Prof Andrew McStay, author of Emotional AI: The Rise of Empathic Media, cautions against going down a “Black Mirror avenue”, referring to the sci-fi TV series created by Charlie Brooker. “It’s quite easy to do the dystopian stuff,” he says, “and I always urge: rather than saying it’s really good or really bad, it’s about specifics.”For McStay, though, emotion AI is dangerous when it affects “future life opportunities” and he is especially concerned about its impact on the workplace. “What we are talking about is 360-degree surveillance,” he says. “Who benefits from that? I certainly don’t think it’s the mass of people within an organisation, ie its workers. We have this suite of technologies but then we also have this suite of financial opportunities. And it’s whether these financial opportunities are a little bit too lucrative for people to be ethically minded. Follow the money, as it were.”McStay also worries about the adoption of Ekman’s basic emotions. A recent report in the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest was damning about the idea that it was possible to accurately interpret emotions simply by analysing a person’s face. One example: you might scowl when you’re angry, but also when you are concentrating or have a headache. “I think you should be very, very sceptical of the Ekman-based approach,” McStay warns. “From the point of view of ad testing, it doesn’t really matter too much because it’s not terribly important. But when you start thinking about it in the context of where life decisions are made about a person, I find that very problematic.”Dr Brent Mittelstadt, a philosopher specialising in data ethics at the University of Oxford’s Internet Institute, finds that he has come across “more troubling examples than positive ones” with regard to emotion AI. “What if emotion AI is used to evaluate the honesty of an inidual, or whether they pose a threat?” he says. “With regard to the former, I’m thinking of the iBorderCtrl system, currently in a pilot phase on the Hungarian, Greek and Latvian borders, which is used to evaluate whether an inidual is giving truthful responses to questions at immigration control. As the relative risk of an application goes up, so too should our demands for accuracy and transparency. In the case of iBorderCtrl, the problem is that iniduals deemed to be lying are not given their test results or information about the functionality and accuracy of the system. Without these, it is very difficult to contest the decision of an automated system.”Despite these concerns, emotion AI looks set to become part of our lives, whether we like it or not. In fact, it already is. If you stand near the Eros statue in Piccadilly Circus looking at the vast advertising screens across the road (AKA the Piccadilly Lights) you will be recorded by two cameras (above Gap) that are the property of Land Securities Group, or LandSec. “When they identify a face, the technology works out an approximate age, sex, mood( –based on whether they think you are frowning or laughing – and notes some characteristics such as whether you wear glasses or whether you have a beard,” LandSec’s website explains.Why do they do this? “Based on the information,” the website continues, “we can display advertising on Piccadilly Lights that the audience are more likely to find relevant and interesting. We can also measure whether people are interested in the advertising by understanding how long they are staring towards the camera.”There are also clear advantages to emotion AI being utilised in retail – and again, it already is. Cameras track you as you move through shops, they see how you react to different products or what you think of in-store advertising displays. Have you given your consent for this exchange? By entering the store, perhaps you have, tacitly. Realeyes did an experiment with Mothercare where it found that customers who were greeted at the door with a smile tended to spend more.McStay notes that emotion AI is now attracting the attention, and funding, of the technology giants. For a long time, it was mainly worked on by startups, largely he thinks because “the Amazons, the Facebooks, the Googles” were put off by “the creepiness factor”. That, however, has now changed: Apple bought the emotion AI startup Emotient in 2016, while Facebook is developing its own emotion-based products. In May, Amazon announced that it had improved its smart assistant Alexa by using AI to detect human emotion. How much we are “aware or in control of” sensitive information we are sharing in these contexts, Mittelstadt argues, is a deeply troubling grey area.“Most companies and organisations agree that we are going to see more of this stuff in the early 2020s,” says McStay. “I would guess around 2021, 2022. That sounds quite fanciful in a sense, but if you begin from the premise that there’s personal, economic and organisational value in understanding human emotion, then there’s a certain inevitability about these technologies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business with The Deaf Traveller, and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

A petition demanding that the HBO channel reshoot it from scratch has now been signed by more than a million viewers.But the creator, George RR Martin, has insisted that the furore over the television adaptation of his fantasy novels won’t change what he writes next.In a rare interview with the Observer which will be published on Sunday, Martin said that the TV show had not been “very good” for him, admitting that its end in May had been “freeing”. He still has two more novels of the fantasy saga to write, but insisted their endings would be unaffected by the controversy over the show’s ending.“No, it doesn’t. It doesn’t change anything at all … You can’t please everybody, so you’ve got to please yourself,” he said.Martin published A Game of Thrones in 1996, the first in a planned seven-volume series called A Song of Ice and Fire. It was adapted by HBO for broadcast in 2011. With the combined success of his books and the show across the world, Martin, 70, is estimated to be worth $65m (£54m). But, he said, his increasing fame had made writing difficult.Martin said he would “let fans have their theories” but that he now steered clear of the intense emotional response the show provoked online.Martin spoke fondly of interactions with fans of his books, but said he was unable to attend the GoT conventions as he once did.“I don’t want to go to a party where an unending succession of people want to take selfies with me,” he said. “Because that’s not fun the way it was in the old days. That’s work.”When asked if he missed the early days, the author was clear: “Yeah. Honestly I do. I mean, I can’t go into a bookstore any more, and that used to be my favourite thing to do in the world. To go in and wander from stack to stack, take down some books, read a little, leave with a big stack of things I’d never heard of when I came in. Now when I go to a bookstore, I get recognised within 10 minutes and there’s a crowd around me. So you gain a lot but you also lose things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/440e545038d4e88ebf4fa18dd2b103b9ad911f9d/0_68_3546_2127/master/3546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a25569b48f3c9cc885a3d9fea7ac454","title":"back me stop salvini renzi casts himself italy saviour","story":"As political turmoil grips Rome, the former prime minister tells the Observer of his mission to thwart a far-right takeoverHis energetic stint at the helm of Italy’s government was brought to a juddering halt when, in 2016, he was effectively sacked by voters after suffering an embarrassing defeat in a constitutional referendum. Now Matteo Renzi is back, casting himself as the man to save Italy from the potential grip of a far-right government led by the League’s Matteo Salvini and calling on all “responsible politicians” to back him to thwart the extremist threat. He is re-entering the fray, he insists, for the sake of the country’s future – and not to reignite his own career.“For my personal rating and consensus it would be better to stay silent,” Renzi told the Observer in an exclusive interview last week. “But Salvini must be stopped, and it’s important to give a strong message – there is an alternative.”Italy, no stranger to political turmoil, has once again been plunged into uncertainty after Salvini, deputy prime minister and leader of the League, announced on 8 August that he was ending his party’s stormy relationship with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), saying it was unworkable due to the incessant quarrelling over policies. Seeking to exploit the League’s growing popularity, Salvini called for snap elections and immediately declared himself a candidate for prime minister, urging supporters to give the League “the strength to take this country in hand and save it”. He took to the campaign trail on the beach, DJ-ing topless and then Instagramming selfies afterwards.But he hadn’t counted on Renzi scheming to derail him. Renzi, a senator, is spearheading talks between factions of the Democratic party (PD) and the M5S, a longtime foe, with the idea of carving out a new majority that could see the government through the delicate autumn budget period, and possibly longer. At first, the idea seemed unthinkable, with the leader of Renzi’s centre-left PD, Nicola Zingaretti, describing it as “a gift to the dangerous right” and his M5S counterpart, Luigi Di Maio, saying he would never “sit at the table with Renzi”.But, since Tuesday, when both parties caught Salvini off-guard by voting against the League’s motion to inflict a vote of no-confidence on prime minister Giuseppe Conte, the proposal has looked more plausible. Conte will address the political crisis in parliament on Tuesday and may face a confidence vote.A return to the centre stage of Italian politics would be quite a turnaround for a man who crashed out spectacularly two and a half years ago. Renzi had intended the referendum on constitutional reform to lead to an ambitious revamp of the political system, with the aim of making it more stable and efficient. Instead, by promising to quit if he lost the vote, it led only to his own departure from Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister’s residence in Rome, and helped lay the foundations on which the League and M5S prospered.After more than a week of twists and turns and rampant speculation, how things will play out on Tuesday is anyone’s guess. If Conte’s address leads to a confidence vote, it might not take place on that day. He could choose to resign, avoiding the vote. There is also the prospect of Salvini resigning and withdrawing his ministers. The power to dissolve parliament rests with president Sergio Mattarella, who could seek an alternative majority or call an election. If he chooses the latter, then an election would need to take place within 45 to 70 days. The last time Italians voted in the autumn was in 1919, when the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini came to power.There are vast differences between the PD and M5S but the main impediment to them striking a deal is Renzi himself. An accord would need the full support of Zingaretti, who told the  in May that he wouldn’t work with a party sullied by the League. In the middle of last week, he was reportedly warming to the idea, but by Friday denied having any interest in a “patch-up” government, adding the PD is ready for elections.Meanwhile, rumours on Friday that a damaged Salvini was seeking to patch things up with the M5S, offering Di Maio the premiership, were blasted by M5S as “fake news”.Renzi may have more followers than Salvini on Twitter, and still wields significant influence within the PD, but there is no denying that his popularity was severely dented by the failed referendum. Many Italians balk at the prospect of him being back at the forefront of politics. He is banking, though, that they will balk more at the prospect of prime minister Salvini. “Salvini is weaker, and this showed on Tuesday: for the first time there was a message against his propaganda,” he said. “If the League won with fake news and propaganda, it will lose with reality and politics.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Respect for \u0026lsquoall the guys who didn\u0026rsquot make it and those still here suffering and injured\u0026rsquoRonan Scully embarks on latest Bay to Bay trek from Waterford to Galway this weekendDeveloper says reclaiming land near Clontarf would create homes for 65,000 peopleISPCA warns removing tails is illegal and weakens dog\u0026rsquos ability to communicate properlyGarda\u0026iacute say those travelling by road should leave plenty of time for journeysMaurice \u0026lsquoMossie\u0026rsquo Keane (79) suffered a stroke late last year and died on WednesdayRescue services called after man got into difficulty in Kilkee on Saturday morningMan in 50s dies in Clonmel after car crashes into pole woman in 60s dies in Thurles crashVictim in a critical condition in hospital after assault in Ballybough areaRomanticising the Troubles contributes to the risk of a return to violence, experts warnJust over a fifth of all stations are now open for 24 hours, analysis showsData Protection Commissioner\u0026rsquos report found documentation retention unlawfulChanges proposed will not fix traffic problems in the area, local councillor saysClaims made that two entrances to be used, one for elected members and one for staffLimerick non-profit calls on Government to ensure asylum seekers receive basic supportsThere are troubling parallels between conditions 50 years ago and the situation nowAugust 17th 1969: Drawing on contemporaneous reports, Donnacha \u0026Oacute Beach\u0026aacutein describes the day\u0026rsquos events as they unfoldedAmong objectors are An Taisce and two prominent international environmental lobbiesAuthorities accuse dual citizen Daniel Mullan (80) of abusing children for decadesMichael Downing was \u0026lsquosimply in the wrong place at the wrong time\u0026rsquo when shot in the Liberties"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3989751.1566063050!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"issues over public services card certainly require change varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at the Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann in  Drogheda, Co Louth, on Saturday. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Leo Varadkar has conceded there are “certainly issues that will need to be changed” in the wake of the controversy over the Public Services Card (PSC). There would have to be alterations involving such issues as retention of data and strengthening of the card’s basis in law, the Taoiseach said. In a damning report sent to the Department of Social Protection this week, the Data Protection Commission found there was no legal reason to make iniduals obtain the card in order to access State services. It was unlawful, the report also found, for the State to retain data gathered as part of the rollout of the card to 3.2 million citizens.Questioned during a weekend visit to the Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann in Drogheda, the Taoiseach said: “There will need to be some changes around the retention of data, transparency and strengthening the legal basis of the Public Services Card.”One of the issues the Government will soon address is the deletion of retained data on cardholders, he added.Response plannedThe Government would be examining the commission’s report in detail and planned to respond “as quickly as possible”.The Taoiseach also cautioned cardholders not to throw out their cards just yet. “Keep it, you’re still going to need it,” he said.The document would still be necessary as a form of identification for access to a number of public services, including pensions, benefits and treatments.Mr Varadkar said he believes the card has been successful in the fundamental purposes set out when it was first established. “The PSC was established a long time ago to help people access public services and crack down on fraud. It has been successful in that regard.‘A good project’“The PSC was around before I became minister for social protection, it continues to exist today and it will into the future,” he said. “It’s still a good project.”When asked whether he would like to see the card become a requirement for certain services, Mr Varadkar said that while that is not Government policy, “it’s something we’ll have to examine the legal basis for”.“So from the point of view of day-to-day experience of the public, it is not going to change very much – but there will be changes that we will have to make as a Government,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3989718.1566058426!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thousands mark 50 years since british army arrived on north s streets","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVeterans attend a parade in Lisburn at a memorial event organised by the Northern Ireland Veterans Association on Saturday to mark the 50th anniversary of the start of Operation Banner, the arrival of British troops onto the streets of Northern Ireland, in 1969. Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty Thousands of people have gathered at a commemorative event in Lisburn to mark the 50th anniversary of British troops being deployed in Northern Ireland in August 1969.Veterans of the British army’s longest-running military operation, Operation Banner, which ended in 2007, were among those to take part in a parade and drumhead and religious service at Wallace Park in the city.The Northern Ireland Veterans Association (NIVA) event on Saturday was organised to commemorate the 763 British soldiers killed during the conflict in the North, and others killed and injured from August 1969 to recent times.Soldier FThe NIVA had previously announced that Parachute Regiment flags or banners referencing “Soldier F”– the British army veteran being pursued on murder charges in connection with deaths on Bloody Sunday – would not be permitted, as the day was about commemoration and remembrance rather than protest.Organisers also said bands which had signed up to play music had agreed to no colour parties or flags.Coronation Street actor Charles Lawson, a NIVA ambassador, whose family served in the British army, said he was “very proud to be in attendance”.“It’s a commemoration, we are not here protesting, we are not here flying flegs (sic), we are not here about that, it’s about commemoration of Operation Banner, and I am very proud to do so,” he said.Mr Lawson said the conflict in the North was a “traumatic and horrible and particularly gruesome time for everyone right across the community”.He refused to be drawn on questions about Bloody Sunday or any other conflict-related incidents.“Terrible things were done by everybody to everybody,” he said.Yvonne Black, the widow of murdered prison officer David Black, said Saturday was a “special, difficult and more emotional day” than she had expected.She said her husband – shot dead by the New IRA in 2012 as he drove to work at Maghaberry prison – was never seen out in uniform, as he was “behind the walls”. “To see people here today representing the Prison Service makes me really proud,” she said.DUP leader Arlene Foster and party chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, a former UDR member, said marking the 50th anniversary was a significant moment for the men and women who served in Operation Banner.Ms Foster said it was a personal commemoration for her as her policeman father had been shot during the course of Operation Banner, so she would be thinking of him and also of “the wider impact the service and sacrifice had in Northern Ireland”.She said veterans “stood between us and anarchy actually during the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s, and therefore we are very grateful”.Mr Donaldson said there needed to be a proper process taken forward now around the legacy of the past, taking on board the concerns of victims and survivors, veterans and others.“This cannot be about the politics of the street,” he said. “It is far too important for that.”Yorkshireman John Hutchinson, a former soldier who served in Belfast, Omagh and South Armagh, was at the event with the Legion Riders motorcycle crew.‘Nobody should be exempt’On the issue of the prosecution of soldiers, he said: “Nobody should be exempt from rule of law, full stop – but if there is a witch hunt, that is not fair. If it was equal, 5050, and they were chasing everybody for crime, I would be quite happy, but it doesn’t seem to be at the moment.”On the wider debate about the appropriateness of commemorations he said, “It depends how you do them.”“There is no vitriol with today, it’s to commemorate the men who were actually murdered,” he said.“We did things for the good and benefit of the public to try and stop terrorism on both sides of the blanket. We weren’t just anti-IRA, we were anti-every bloody terrorist.”Belfast-born former army Captain Terry Bashford (73), who served in the army from 1961 to 2013, said he was “paying respect to all the guys who didn’t make it and those still here suffering and injured”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3988204.1565960800!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"n%C3%B3ra quoirin the unanswered questions","story":"Police in Malaysia have said Franco-Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin probably died of starvation and stress after spending a week in the jungle. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Vulnerable since the day she was born’: Nóra Quoirin. Photograph: Lucie Blackman TrustFamily handoutPA WireThe Quoirin family had planned to spend two weeks of August relaxing in Malaysia, and Nóra – “fun, funny and extremely loving” – was excited about the holiday. But the 15-year-old, who had special needs, was also “not like other teenagers… not independent”, they said.After she was found to be missing from the Dusun holiday resort, on Sunday, August 4th, shortly after their arrival, they explained: “Nóra can read like a young child, but she cannot write more than a few words. She has a good memory, but she cannot understand anything conceptual. She is unable to do maths, and so things like money are impossible to manage.”They added that Nóra’s balance was limited and that she struggled with co-ordination. “She has been to Asia, and many European countries before, and has never wandered off or got lost.Nóra Quoirin’s body was found on Tuesday, August 13th, by a group of hikers who had volunteered their help. It was the 10th day of the search for the schoolgirl.She was found unclothed, near a stream, in a hard-to-access hilly area that had already been covered by the search-and-rescue operation. The location is 2km from the resort the family had checked in to 11 days earlier. It is an area of dense jungle near the town of Seremban, about 60km from the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.Her body was flown to Seremban by helicopter. On Thursday, Malaysian police announced the results of a 10-hour postmortem and said there was no evidence of foul play. The chief of police in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Mohamad Mat Yusop, said: “The cause of death was upper-gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer complicated with perforation.” There was no evidence that Nóra had been abducted or raped, he added.The bleeding in Nóra’s intestine could have been caused by prolonged hunger and stress, Mohamad said the pathologists dated Nóra’s death to two or three days before her body was found, and to no more than four days.The Quoirin family, who have lived in London for about 20 years, have said they will now bring her home, “where she will finally be laid to rest, close to her loving families in France and Ireland”.Their statement issued on Friday says: “The initial postmortem results have given some information that help us to understand Nóra’s cause of death. But our beautiful, innocent girl died in extremely complex circumstances, and we are hoping that soon we will have more answers to our many questions. We are still struggling to understand the events of the last 10 days.”The Lucie Blackman Trust, which has been helping the family, says that investigations in France will continue. It also urges an end to public speculation. “The police hotline remains open, and the family are still seeking any information from the public that can help to provide clarity on the events of the last 10 days.”A reward of 50,000 ringgit, or about €10,800, had been offered the day before Nóra’s body was found, donated by an anonymous Belfast-based business. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which was set up to support British nationals in crisis overseas, has confirmed that none of the reward has been paid in connection with the discovery of the teenager’s body.Dusun Eco Resort sits in a durian orchard in the foothills of the Titiwangsa Mountains, next to the 1,600-hectare, or 4,000-acre, Berembun Forest Reserve, which is home to sun bears, white-handed gibbons, macaques, wild pigs, panthers, tapirs and muntjac. Locals have seen leopard tracks. The resort has six guest houses on the top of a small hill.Many visitors scale Gunung Telapak Buruk, the highest mountain in the vicinity, and some seek out a site where a second World War plane crashed. Locals say many hikers get lost without a torch when night falls, having underestimated the time it takes to get to the crash site.Several questions remain about Nóra’s disappearance and death. Why would she have left the resort in the middle of the night? Did she climb out of the downstairs window that was found open when she disappeared and on which police found unidentified fingerprints?Why was her body found unclothed? If Nóra did walk off into the jungle, why could sniffer dogs pick up her scent only in the immediate vicinity of the guest house? Does this suggest she was abducted?Nóra’s body was found in an area that had already been covered by search-and-rescue teams, so how is it that they did not see her?The area where Nóra’s body was found had been covered until day seven of Nóra’s disappearance. Perhaps, Mohamad Mat Yusop said, Nóra was still moving around at that time. After day seven the search-and-rescue teams concentrated on the Gunung Berembun area.A Daily Mail reporter, Paul Thompson, interviewed Sean Yeap, one of the hikers who discovered Nóra’s body. Yeap told him that the body was not hidden or covered with foliage and said he would have expected search teams that had passed through the area previously to have found it, had it been there at the time.Although police say the bleeding in Nóra’s intestine was most likely caused by prolonged hunger and stress, stomach ulcers can be caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria. Nóra might have drunk contaminated water, although this cannot be established.“It is not possible she would have willingly left with a stranger,” he said. “If she went out alone by mistake, she would have banged on the door and screamed to be let back in.”Pacôme Quoirin said the family did not question the information released by Malaysian police after the postmortem. “Her death was caused by a haemorrhage, as they said. But what were the conditions that led to it? The findings that were announced in no way discredit a criminal act. She could have been kidnapped and fed at the beginning. There is insufficient evidence to jump to definitive conclusions.”The Quoirins’ lawyer Sankara N Nair said on Wednesday that he would contact the Malaysian attorney general, Tommy Thomas, about holding an inquest into Nóra’s death if the postmortem provided evidence to support that course of action.On Thursday the Malay Mail quoted the Negeri Sembilan police chief as saying the Irish and French police who observed the postmortem were satisfied with the work of the team who had carried it out. The Irish authorities had not requested a second examination.The search for Nóra involved expert trackers from the Senoi Praaq special unit, made up mainly of members of the Orang Asli indigenous people, and members of the elite 69 Commando unit of the Royal Malaysian Police. Divers searched the river that runs through the forest, and helicopters and drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras were deployed.To aid in the search, a recording of Nóra’s mother’s voice was played via megaphones. Search teams also played the recording of Meabh Quoirin’s voice on their mobile phones as they went through the jungle.The Lucie Blackman Trust has been helping the family to deal with the media, and organised the printing of 10,000 flyers to be distributed in Kuala Lumpur and several Malaysian states, including Melaka and Johor.More than £104,000, or €114,000, has been raised by a GoFundMe appeal launched by Aisling Agnew, Nóra’s aunt, on behalf of Nóra’s family. Nearly €20,000 has been raised in a separate GoFundMe appeal set up by Pacôme Quoirin.Hundreds of people in Seremban prayed for Nóra during the Muslim festival of Hari Raya Aidiladha, as Malaysians call Eid ul-Fitr.The Dusun family and staff also expressed their condolences. “We are devastated by the turn of events, and we would like to extend our support and assistance in whatever way possible to the Quoirins during these very difficult times,” they said. A Dusun spokeswoman said on Friday that while investigations continued she could not respond to criticisms of the resort for having insufficient CCTV.There is much speculation about Nóra’s disappearance. It ranges from the cautious public statements by some members of the Quoirin family, gently probing aspects of the investigation, to the numerous theories – some fanciful – advanced on social media.Many Malaysians believe in spirits and there is even talk of her having being hidden by the Orang bunian, supernatural beings known as the hidden or whistling people, who are said to be invisible except to people with spiritual sight and are generally regarded as benevolent.The tragedy has had an impact both locally and internationally, but none have felt it so keenly as her family. After Nóra’s disappearance and the harrowing search for her, the Quoirins are having to deal not only with the results of the postmortem but also with the devastating loss of a girl her mother described as “precious” and “vulnerable since the day she was born”.Her family have many unanswered questions.

This year 25.5 per cent of A-level grades were A* or A, which is the lowest proportion since 2007. Boys saw a greater fall in the number of top grades, by 1.2 percentage points compared with a 0.7 percentage point fall among girls.

Listed alongside the litany of famous spots is Victoria Pier’s public toilets in Hull which is the book’s 483rd entry. Described as “gorgeous temples of lavatorial luxury” the Grade II Edwardian style bathrooms which cost a penny to enter were the “personal favourite” of Tom Hall, Lonely Planet editorial director, although he acknowledged that their presence on the list was controversial. “The toilet in Hull is marked 483, it’s not number one on the list, we’re not saying it’s the best place to visit in the UK but it’s important to have a little bit of fun with guides like this and we wanted to include some more quirky locations,” he said.  The toilet earned a spot on the list over other Hull destinations like Humber Bridge and Wilbeforce House Museum. The Deep described as “Britain’s most spectacular aquarium” is featured on the list. “There might be places in East York or Hull that people will feel has been overlooked but no one said they’re not great or don’t deserve a place,” Mr Hall said. “A book of 500 is always going to generate debate. I have been fielding complaints from people in South Yorkshire because their county doesn’t make the list. We are keen to hear people’s feedback.”Local councillor, Anita Harrison welcomed the inclusion of the bathrooms on the list. “These toilets are a step-back in time for the many that use them. They are a timeless feature offering a whole host of Edwardian character, and I am delighted to see it has been recommended as a place to visit as part of the Lonely Planet list,” she said.Hong Kong sells out of face masks and shin pads (and cakes) in mini-boom from protestsGhislaine Maxwell donated to hospital where Epstein victim was treated after alleged sexual assaultArchers matriarchs use their money to control their children, says Oxford academicEpstein\u0026#39s lawyers \u0026#39not satisfied\u0026#39 with autopsy conclusion and vow to carry out independent investigation\u0026#39We\u0026#39re in a bad place\u0026#39 says devastated father of murdered Pc Andrew Harper  Peter Duncan murder: teenager charged after devoted father stabbed with screwdriver in NewcastleHow China\u0026#39s propaganda machine is whitewashing Hong Kong protests and rallying mainlanders against pro-Democracy movementExodus at Italy\u0026#39s top museums as populist government sweeps away renaissanceComment: Spare me the peace and love mythology of Woodstock – there\u0026#39s nothing more phoney than a festival\u0026#39Only final victory over America can bring peace\u0026#39 -

Pick incorrectly and it could derail the whole enterprise.Find the right person, though – someone with the right blend of confidence, naivety and unselfconsciousness – and the results can be breathtaking.This week sees Jacob Tremblay continue his run of impressive roles with Good Boys, which follows three sixth grade boys who ditch school and embark on an epic journey while carrying accidentally stolen drugs. Before that, he starred in the 2015 drama Room, giving a performance that was as deserving of an Oscar as his co-star Brie Larson, who took home Best Actress. And he’s still only 12.In celebration, we\u0027ve counted down the 18 most memorable performances by children in cinema. Click through the gallery below to see who made the cut.Created with Sketch.18 best child performances in film history Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation. And it’s no surprise, given how convincingly she brought to life, at the age of 13, Ian McEwan’s precocious and stubborn protagonist Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of a romantic encounter between her sister and her childhood friend wreaks havoc in the lives of those around her. (EH)318 Quvenzhané Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)Quvenzhané Wallis is proof that lying sometimes gets you places. As a five-year-old, the child star convinced her parents to let her fib about her age so that she could audition for Beasts of the Southern Wild – their minimum age was six. So impressed was director Benh Zeitlin by Wallis that he changed his entire script so that the character of Hushpuppy matched her stubborn personality. At the age of nine, she became the youngest Best Actress nominee in Oscars history. (JS)418 Aleksei Kravchenko in Come and See (1985)Horrific war film Come and See – which depicts Nazism through a child’s eyes – is a nightmarish but essential experience, if only to witness the performance of Aleksei Kravchenko. It would have been tough for an actor of any age to film the scenes asked of him by director Elem Klimov let alone a 14-year old one, but Kravchenko commits so nobly it’s hard to tear your eyes from the screen. He found the shoot so troubling that he reportedly developed grey hair. (JS)518 Jean-Pierre Léaud in The 400 Blows (1959)Jean-Pierre Léaud was one of several hundred boys who François Truffaut auditioned for The 400 Blows and it’s easy to see why he won the role. In Truffaut, Léaud found a mentor –  he took control of the 15-year-old\u0027s upbringing when shooting ended after he was expelled from school and kicked out of his carers’ home – and Léaud would return as the character five more times. (JS)618 Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone (1990)Considering he starts Home Alone as an obnoxious “little jerk”, it’s a testament to Macaulay Culkin’s skill that Kevin McCallister manages to worm his way into viewers’ hearts . Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered. (AW)118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation. And it’s no surprise, given how convincingly she brought to life, at the age of 13, Ian McEwan’s precocious and stubborn protagonist Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of a romantic encounter between her sister and her childhood friend wreaks havoc in the lives of those around her. (EH)318 Quvenzhané Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)Quvenzhané Wallis is proof that lying sometimes gets you places. As a five-year-old, the child star convinced her parents to let her fib about her age so that she could audition for Beasts of the Southern Wild – their minimum age was six. So impressed was director Benh Zeitlin by Wallis that he changed his entire script so that the character of Hushpuppy matched her stubborn personality. At the age of nine, she became the youngest Best Actress nominee in Oscars history. (JS)418 Aleksei Kravchenko in Come and See (1985)Horrific war film Come and See – which depicts Nazism through a child’s eyes – is a nightmarish but essential experience, if only to witness the performance of Aleksei Kravchenko. It would have been tough for an actor of any age to film the scenes asked of him by director Elem Klimov let alone a 14-year old one, but Kravchenko commits so nobly it’s hard to tear your eyes from the screen. He found the shoot so troubling that he reportedly developed grey hair. (JS)518 Jean-Pierre Léaud in The 400 Blows (1959)Jean-Pierre Léaud was one of several hundred boys who François Truffaut auditioned for The 400 Blows and it’s easy to see why he won the role. In Truffaut, Léaud found a mentor –  he took control of the 15-year-old\u0027s upbringing when shooting ended after he was expelled from school and kicked out of his carers’ home – and Léaud would return as the character five more times. (JS)618 Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone (1990)Considering he starts Home Alone as an obnoxious “little jerk”, it’s a testament to Macaulay Culkin’s skill that Kevin McCallister manages to worm his way into viewers’ hearts . Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered.

And should we be worried?What’s going on in financial markets?A closely watched indicator has signalled that the markets are becoming increasingly pessimistic about the future\u0026nbspof the US and UK economies.Market indicator that preceded last 7 US recessions flips againTraders and economists are concerned that that the yields are\u0026nbsphigher for short-term bonds than for bonds maturing further away in the future. That is unusual as investors generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.The last time it happened in the US was in 2007.They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds. This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.It implies first of all that investors, fearing for the future, are looking for safety. US stock markets have fallen sharply as risky assets like shares have been sold off in favour of bonds which are government-backed and pay a fixed return.It\u0026nbspalso signals that investors think a recession is due which would prompt central banks - in this case the Federal Reserve and Bank of England - to cut interest rates in the future.How concerned should we be?Major economic downturns in the US, but also in other advanced economies, have usually been preceded by this economic indicator.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK hard.But there have also been examples were the\u0026nbspyield curve inverted but no recession followed, such as in the UK in the early 2000s.In the past there has also been a significant lag of around 10 months to three years between this indicator and a subsequent recession.Why has this happened?News on both the UK and US economies has been pretty negative of late. Under Boris Johnson the risk of a no-deal Brexit has risen sharply and last week we learned that the UK economy had unexpectedly shrink in the last quarter. This week, inflation came in higher than expected.The US outlook is being damaged by trade tensions with China which have seen the Trump administration hit the majority of Chinese imports with tariffs. Beijing has responded in kind with its own tariffs on US imports.Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, said the latest inversion of the yield curve said more about the global economy as a whole than the US in particular.“We are looking at Germany, we are looking at, above all, China and we are going, ‘This isn’t good, these are meant to be motors of global trade’.”China\u0027s latest figures show that industrial output grew much weaker than forecast.So how worried should we be?We should be wary, but not panicking.The US yield curve is not a failsafe predictor of recession. And there are various technical reasons why it may be distorted at the moment.Yet the voices arguing that the global financial system is not yet safe are credible and should be heeded\u0026nbspregardless of whether or not we are about to enter a new global recession.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Non-store retailing, which covers mostly online sales, jumped 6.9 per cent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCompared with July 2018, overall sales grew 3.3 per cent, again boosted by online shopping. This was a smaller rise than in June but above economists’ expectations. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever, on the three-month measure, which strips out some of the volatility in the figures, sales ticked up only by 0.5 per cent from the February-April period. This was the slowest pace of growth since the end of last year.\u0026nbspDuncan Brewer, retail and consumer partner at Oliver Wyman, says there were two main drivers behind July’s retail sales: a record-breaking heatwave that kept shoppers away from bricks-and-mortar shops and heavy discounting online.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbsp“Our research shows that 75 per cent of purchases during heavy discounting periods cannibalise full-price sales, as UK shoppers look to buy planned purchases rather than new, spontaneous products.”\u0026nbsp“Looking ahead, Brexit will be a major factor in consumer spending behaviour regardless of discounting. Shoppers will likely buy their Christmas shopping ahead of the 31 October deadline to avoid higher prices due to increased tariffs in the case of a no-deal Brexit.”Unlike farmers, British consumers seem to have been able to shrug off Brexit uncertainty, so far at least.\u0026nbspRanko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on today\u0027s UK retail sales data:\u0026nbspIt would seem UK consumers still don’t give a fig about Brexit, and remain more than willing to spend their real wage increases. \u0026nbspThe report bodes well for a likely growth bump in Q3, as there are few signs that consumers are growing anywhere near as wary of no-deal as businesses.One argument for chlorinated poultry is that it is cheaper.\u0026nbspZippy Duvall of the\u0026nbspAmerican Farm Bureau told the BBC that the UK public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspA lot of our farmers don\u0027t understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don\u0027t want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it\u0027s grown at.Is US chicken really cheaper?\u0026nbspUsing US government data from 2015, a report\u0026nbspfrom free-market think tank, The Adam Smith Institute,\u0026nbspcalculated\u0026nbspthat US consumers pay 21 per cent less for a kilogram\u0026nbspof chicken than their counterparts in the UK.The think tank has therefore advocated negotiating a trade deal that would allow for imports of chlorine-treated meat. The ASI report does not provide evidence demonstrating a causal link between chlorine washing and cheaper poultry prices in supermarkets. Other factors could also be at play.\u0026nbspWho funds the Adam Smith Institute?

Washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill off harmful bacteria is banned in the EU. And unlike the US, the EU has also not approved any fresh genetically modified (GM) fruit or vegetables for human consumption.But Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said concerns over the practices are not “science-based”.“There is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash, just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer in Georgia, told BBC Radio 4.“If there was something wrong with it, our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Created with Sketch.The exercise it takes to burn off high-calorie foods Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 calories310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 caloriesBoth the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the British Poultry Council have said eating meat treated in that way is safe.However, the EFSA opposes chlorine rinsing because it enables farmers to lower their standards of animal welfare and hygiene as they can simply use a chemical bath to kill off any harmful pathogens after animals are slaughtered.The EU takes what it calls an integrated approach to food safety, “from farm to fork covering all sectors of the food chain”. As part of that approach, there are minimum legal requirements for the amount of space, lighting and ventilation in EU poultry-rearing houses.As there are no laws governing this in the US, the birds can be crammed in tightly, according to Simon Dawson, a food safety expert at Cardiff politan University. This reduces production costs but increases the risks of disease and contamination in a flock.“Some US abattoirs and processing plants rely heavily on chlorination because their other hygiene standards are so poor that they would be illegal in Europe,” Mr Dawson wrote in 2017.“The process is also very good at removing odours and surface slime, meaning the meat can be passed off as fresh for much longer than it should be.”The EU is less strict on GM food, allowing some such products to be sold provided the EFSA has deemed them safe and they are labelled as GM.The World Health Organisation says it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM crops, and that each food should be assessed separately.Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s national security adviser said the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal with the US after Brexit.John Bolton suggested that the US could focus on striking bilateral trade deals in certain sectors like manufacturing and car-making and work out more complicated areas later.According to Mr Duvall, though, any trade agreement would have to include agriculture.“To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that’s where a big part of our population lives,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies.\u0026nbsp“We have been clear on numerous occasions that we will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards as part of any trade deals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

due in no small part to the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and amplified by the impact of weather and tracking against national sporting events in the same period last year.As a result our non-food business has been challenged during the period, however we\u0027re satisfied that our food business has continued to perform well and our online growth continues to outpace the market.Despite all this, Asda\u0027s\u0026nbsptotal sales were up 1.3 per cent\u0026nbspIn the three months to 30 June.Good morning and welcome to The Independent\u0027s coverage of today\u0027s business and economic events.\u0026nbspMore than half of farms will go bust if\u0026nbspBoris Johnson\u0026nbspforces through a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit,\u0026nbspfarmers\u0026nbspare warning, as some join the campaign for a fresh referendum.A deadly cocktail of immediate\u0026nbsptariffs, border checks, increased red tape and cheaper food imports from outside the EU will result in the “decimation of UK farming”, a detailed study finds.Read the full story here from our deputy political editor Rob Merrick:Brexit: Farmers call for fresh referendum as they warn half of farms will go bust after no-deal exit\u0026nbspThe UK has been told by the American farming lobby that it must accept US standards such as allowing chlorinated chicken and the sale of genetically modified crops as part of a post-Brexit trade deal.\u0026nbspZippy Duval, head of the American Farm Bureau, told the BBC\u0026nbspthat fears about US practices were not science-based.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspYou know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine, Mr Duvall told the BBC\u0027s Today programme.So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away.If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that, he added.The US has already laid out what it is looking for from a trade deal with the UK:\u0026nbsphttps:ustr.govsitesdefaultfilesSummary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf\u0026nbspIt specifically does not like EU measures it deems to be not science-based.\u0026nbspIn trade speak:\u0026nbspObtain commitment that the UK will not foreclose export opportunities to the United States with respect to third-country export markets, including by requiring third countries to align with non-science based restrictions and requirements or to adopt SPS measures that are not based on ascertainable risk.\u0026nbspSPS measures  food hygiene standards\u0026nbspWorth noting that while US farmers may not believe a ban on chlorinated chicken is science-based, there are far more cases of salmonella per person in the US than in the UK.\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit could force more than half of British farms out of business, farmers are warning.\u0026nbspWhy?\u0026nbsp* The EU, plus third countries with which it has trade agreements, would immediately slap tariffs on food exports from the UK.*\u0026nbspTariff-free imports of many agricultural products\u0026nbspwould have to be offered to non-EU countries as well, including the USA, Brazil and Australia – undermining domestic farming* It would also be hit by new non-tariff barriers, including administrative costs and border checks to ensure compliance with EU food safety and animal health regulations.* It would face an effective trade embargo on exports of animal-based products, while the UK and the EU negotiated an agreement.* The removal of support payments – with only a proportion likely to be covered by Whitehall – and an adverse trading environment will “render the majority of farm businesses unviable”.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the competition watchdog has called for the break-up of two recently-merged medical technology firms after finding the deal could lead to the NHS and charities paying higher prices.Sweden-based Tobii bought UK rival Smartbox for £11m last year, but the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has now ordered Tobii to sell off the business.The announcement comes after an investigation by independent CMA panel members concluded that the tie-up could result in a reduction in quality, less new product development, and higher prices.\u0026nbspPress AssociationIn the markets, the FTSE 100 has opened up 0.5\u0026nbspper cent down at 7,115.53.\u0026nbspTobacco companies are the biggest climbers, RBS and B\u0026ampQ owner Kingfisher are the worst performers.\u0026nbspEuropean stocks are stabilising after fears of a recession sparked a sell-off yesterday.UK retail sales grew in July, lifted by a surge in online sales, according to official data.\u0026nbspThe quantity bought last month rose 0.2 per cent compared with June, defying economists’ forecasts for a 0.2 per cent drop. Non-store retailing, which covers mostly online sales, jumped 6.9 per cent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCompared with July 2018, overall sales grew 3.3 per cent, again boosted by online shopping. This was a smaller rise than in June but above economists’ expectations. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever, on the three-month measure, which strips out some of the volatility in the figures, sales ticked up only by 0.5 per cent from the February-April period. This was the slowest pace of growth since the end of last year.\u0026nbspDuncan Brewer, retail and consumer partner at Oliver Wyman, says there were two main drivers behind July’s retail sales: a record-breaking heatwave that kept shoppers away from bricks-and-mortar shops and heavy discounting online.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbsp“Our research shows that 75 per cent of purchases during heavy discounting periods cannibalise full-price sales, as UK shoppers look to buy planned purchases rather than new, spontaneous products.”\u0026nbsp“Looking ahead, Brexit will be a major factor in consumer spending behaviour regardless of discounting. Shoppers will likely buy their Christmas shopping ahead of the 31 October deadline to avoid higher prices due to increased tariffs in the case of a no-deal Brexit.”Unlike farmers, British consumers seem to have been able to shrug off Brexit uncertainty, so far at least.\u0026nbspRanko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on today\u0027s UK retail sales data:\u0026nbspIt would seem UK consumers still don’t give a fig about Brexit, and remain more than willing to spend their real wage increases. \u0026nbspThe report bodes well for a likely growth bump in Q3, as there are few signs that consumers are growing anywhere near as wary of no-deal as businesses.One argument for chlorinated poultry is that it is cheaper.\u0026nbspZippy Duvall of the\u0026nbspAmerican Farm Bureau told the BBC that the UK public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspA lot of our farmers don\u0027t understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don\u0027t want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it\u0027s grown at.Is US chicken really cheaper?\u0026nbspUsing US government data from 2015, a report\u0026nbspfrom free-market think tank, The Adam Smith Institute,\u0026nbspcalculated\u0026nbspthat US consumers pay 21 per cent less for a kilogram\u0026nbspof chicken than their counterparts in the UK.The think tank has therefore advocated negotiating a trade deal that would allow for imports of chlorine-treated meat. The ASI report does not provide evidence demonstrating a causal link between chlorine washing and cheaper poultry prices in supermarkets. Other factors could also be at play.\u0026nbspWho funds the Adam Smith Institute? No one knows because they won\u0027t tell anyone.TSB has apologised yet again after more problems with its online banking and mobile app.\u0026nbspCustomers would not get into their accounts between 4am and 7am on Thursday morning after problems with routine maintenance.\u0026nbspTSB\u0027s suffered a disastrous IT meldown last year which caused many people to lose access to online banking services.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn\u0027s plan to bring down Boris Johnson with a no-confidence vote is boosting the pound.\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.64 per cent against the dollar to $1.2136\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspand 0.5 per cent against the euro to €1.088 so far.\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspsays it will attempt to bring down\u0026nbspBoris Johnson\u0027s government within days\u0026nbspof MPs returning to parliament after the summer recess, in an effort to stop a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit.Senior frontbencher\u0026nbspRebecca Long-Bailey\u0026nbspmade the remarks as\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspdelivered a\u0026nbspdramatic offer to be caretaker prime minister\u0026nbspand secure a Brexit extension if he is successful in toppling Mr Johnson.More from Ashley Cowburn:Labour to attempt to bring down Boris Johnson\u0027s government within \u0027days\u0027 of parliament resuming\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf Britain wants a trade deal with the US, it must accept American food standards, including those allowing genetic modification and chicken to be washed in chlorine, the head of America’s farming lobby has said.Both of those practices are controversial in the UK.

As such, it is unclear how Apple will choose to name them.The current line-up is made up of the iPhone XS, which is the luxury version the XS Max, which is the same but bigger and the iPhone XR, which is cheaper but in the middle of the sizes.The new phones are rumoured to have the same rough structure, which has led to questions about how they could be named. Apple could stick with the roman numerals and name the new phone XI, for instance, or could drop the numbers in the same way as it did with the iPads.But a new series of reports suggest that the new phones could actually be called the iPhone 11. The luxury version is rumoured to be called the iPhone 11 Pro, according to the same reports, and the bigger version is due to keep the Max branding.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

But they have been known to be wrong in the past, especially with the naming and branding of products, which can be changed at the last moment.Apple is expected to unveil the new phones in the second week of September, at a media event that will be broadcast around the world.

Why can’t he deliver that promise rather than the disaster of a no-mandate\u0026nbspno deal?”And Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “A no-deal Brexit must be taken off the table. Not only, as the poll shows, is there no public support for it, it is also incredibly irresponsible for any government to pursue something that will result in job losses, damage to our economy and hit our public services.”Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks -

But reality is more complicatedClick to followThe IndependentIf Britain wants a trade deal with the US, it must accept American food standards, including those allowing genetic modification and chicken to be washed in chlorine, the head of America’s farming lobby has said.Both of those practices are controversial in the UK. Washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill off harmful bacteria is banned in the EU. And unlike the US, the EU has also not approved any fresh genetically modified (GM) fruit or vegetables for human consumption.But Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said concerns over the practices are not “science-based”.“There is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash, just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer in Georgia, told BBC Radio 4.“If there was something wrong with it, our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Created with Sketch.The exercise it takes to burn off high-calorie foods Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 calories310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 caloriesBoth the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the British Poultry Council have said eating meat treated in that way is safe.However, the EFSA opposes chlorine rinsing because it enables farmers to lower their standards of animal welfare and hygiene as they can simply use a chemical bath to kill off any harmful pathogens after animals are slaughtered.The EU takes what it calls an integrated approach to food safety, “from farm to fork covering all sectors of the food chain”. As part of that approach, there are minimum legal requirements for the amount of space, lighting and ventilation in EU poultry-rearing houses.As there are no laws governing this in the US, the birds can be crammed in tightly, according to Simon Dawson, a food safety expert at Cardiff politan University. This reduces production costs but increases the risks of disease and contamination in a flock.“Some US abattoirs and processing plants rely heavily on chlorination because their other hygiene standards are so poor that they would be illegal in Europe,” Mr Dawson wrote in 2017.“The process is also very good at removing odours and surface slime, meaning the meat can be passed off as fresh for much longer than it should be.”The EU is less strict on GM food, allowing some such products to be sold provided the EFSA has deemed them safe and they are labelled as GM.The World Health Organisation says it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM crops, and that each food should be assessed separately.Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s national security adviser said the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal with the US after Brexit.John Bolton suggested that the US could focus on striking bilateral trade deals in certain sectors like manufacturing and car-making and work out more complicated areas later.According to Mr Duvall, though, any trade agreement would have to include agriculture.“To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that’s where a big part of our population lives,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies.\u0026nbsp“We have been clear on numerous occasions that we will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards as part of any trade deals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There were security checkpoints in every city centre street, bag searches in most shops.In my teenage years, when I attended school in the west of Ulster, one of my fellow pupils was killed in the infamous IRA bomb attack on Lord Mountbatten’s boat off the Irish coast in .Two years later, the terrorist and hunger striker Bobby Sands was briefly my MP before his self-inflicted death, an event that provoked more rioting.Despite the ruthlessness of the IRA, the British security forces never wavered in their duty.Even in the face of mortal danger from petrol bombs, stones and even bullets, the soldiers did not buckle.In the cauldron of historic animosities, stoked by the venom of the IRA, they showed impressive forbearance, undermining the Republican propaganda about British oppression.There were disastrous failures, however, like the loss of discipline at Bloody Sunday in Derry, , when British paratroopers fired on a group of protesters, killing  of them.Over the years, their tenacity gradually wore down the enemy, particularly through the use of sophisticated military intelligence.Towards the end of the s, the entire IRA network was riddled with British agents.Even Frank Scappaticci, the Republicans’ own head of its feared Internal Security Unit – known as the “Nutting Squad” - was alleged to be an informer.Such deep penetration made it almost impossible for the IRA to carry on using the bomb and the bullet effectively .By the close of the Troubles, British security forces were estimated to be foiling two out of every three planned IRA operations.One former IRA man, now a Dublin solicitor, admitted, “It was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.”It was a defeat that heralded a new era in Northern Ireland.In practice, the peace process was a declaration of surrender by the IRA.Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness did not suddenly see the light and become peaceniks.They embraced democratic politics because they recognised that their terror movement, beaten by the British forces, could no longerproperly.After the Good Friday Agreement of , the Republicans agreed to decommission their weapons without achieving any of their key political aims. Northern Ireland remains in the United Kingdom, while the partition of Ireland continues.For political reasons, the British army has never received the credit it deserves for its remarkable victory.In the new climate of co-operation, there is an understandable wish to avoid any triumphalism.But what is reprehensible is the persistent hounding of British veterans who bravely served their country in the Troubles, but are now the subject of official inquiries into past misconduct.No fewer than  of these veterans are said to be currently under investigation, despite endless pledges from politicians about an end to the grotesque witch-hunts.The gross betrayal of their service is bad enough, but even more offensive are the double-standards, for the Good Friday Agreement facilitated the early release of scores of terrorists, as well an amnesty for many on the run.If the peace process is meant to draw a line in the sand about Ulster’s dark past, it should apply to everyone.Thanks in large part to the efforts of the British army, the future should be bright for Northern Ireland.But clouds are gathering, due to suspension of the devolved assembly and concerns about a hard border because of Brexit.The fragility of the situation means that British politicians should tread carefully, respecting the rights of both communities in the province, as well as the interests of Dublin, our closest neighbour.But the Tories have done anything but that.Having thrown away their majority in , they have formed a dubious alliance with the DUP, a reactionary outfit which presents itself as the voice of Ulster but in fact won only  per cent of the vote at the last election.As cheerleaders for unionism, the Conservatives now talk about “our precious union”, while regrettably Boris Johnson has even given himself the additional title of “Minister for the Union.”Whilst many Brits feel passionate about keeping the union together, this rhetoric may not be what Northern Ireland needs.The British Government is meant to be an honest broker rather than a partisan advocate for one side.“Rigorous impartiality” was central to the success of the Good Friday Agreement. For the sake of harmony, that spirit cannot be allowed to disappear.The campaign in Northern Ireland may not have had the glamour of victories like Egypts El Alamein or Waterloo, but it was still one of the British army’s greatest achievements.It would be a tragedypast military determination were to be squandered by present political bungling.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasn’t fake fur at all,” the trader said.“It looked like he needed to be dusted.”And the tiger, the trader said, “was huge.”“I don’t think the pictures really give proper dimensions,” he said.“The desk had to be one of the biggest desks I’ve ever seen, and that tiger just dwarfed it.”The trader said he was ushered out of Epstein’s office after about  minutes and brought to a nondescript waiting room before being introduced to the financier.“I remember he had a really hot secretary and he came off with a lot of bravado,” the trader said.But while Epstein was “very enthusiastic during the presentation,” he never followed up afterward, despite the fact that he heard pitches from a group of hedge funders who offered “four dferent strategies and styles.”“There were some really quality guys that we put before him,” the trader said.“It makes me think – just purely speculation – that they weren’t really trading, just pretending to trade.” The paedophile banker, , died from hanging last Saturday in his jail cell while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges.Since his arrest and suicide, Epstein’s New York townhouse has become a dark tourism attraction with people posing for pictures outside the Upper East Side property.Earlier this week, it was revealed that the disgraced financier kept a bizarre painting of former US President Bill Clinton wearing a blue dress.A version of this story originally appeared on The New York Post."},{"url":null,"title":"giant spiders to invade uk homes again summer washout","story":"The August washout could bring the insects into our homes quicker than expected - as spiders believe its already autumn.Spiders usually seek shelter in warm places during September, but frantic homeowners across the country are already spotting the creepy crawlies in their homes.Central heating provides the perfect conditions for the females to lay their eggs, and the summer deluge has tricked the spiders into thinking its already mating season.This summer has been a weather whirlwind for Britain - as the hottest July ever was recorded, swtly followed by one of the wettest Augusts on record.The hottest day EVER was recorded this July, as mercury reached a sweltering .C in Cambridge.However, the warm weather didnt last long - as August brought downpours, severe weather warnings, and is now on track to be the wettest August on record.The dramatic weather change has caused confusion for the eight-legged creatures, bringing them into our homes sooner than expected.Pest controller Clive Boase has also warned of a rise in  widows — the UKs only native poisonous spider, which have shiny black bodies.He said: “They’re more common than most people think.There are half-a-dozen dferent species of the  widow and they can survive both indoors and outdoors.They prefer suburban areas and are most commonly found around domestic and commercial premises.They love conservatories and toilet blocks, window frames, porches, lofts and garages and they like to live beneath kitchen appliances and cupboards.“They certainly can give a painful bite but only as a last resort.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cycling leave women struggling to orgasm no satisfaction between sheets","story":"It revealed that  per cent of female cyclists reported bedroom issues, including loss of desire, lower satisfaction and dficulty reaching orgasm.That compares to rates of sexual dys in the general population of around  per cent.US research involving  women cyclists with an average age of  found nearly seven out of ten were left saddle sore, with pain or numbness to their genitals.The effects were shown to last up to a week.Doctors think sitting in the saddle blocks blood flow to vital organs and traps key nerves.Writing in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, lead researcher Daniel Greenberg from Stanford University, Calornia, said: “We found genital pain and numbness from cycling were strongly associated with both decreased arousal and satisfaction with orgasm.“This suggests that repeated interruptions of blood flow or nerve entrapment can decrease genital sensation and increase odds of sexual dys.”Fewer than three per cent of the participants were professional cyclists.Those who used wider saddles were  per cent less likely to suffer pain, experts found.Cycling has been linked to erectile problems in men, but until now there has been little research on its effects on women.Prof Raj Persad, consultant urologist with Bristol Urology Associates, said: “Spreading the pressure points over a larger area, by using a wider seat, and reducing time in the saddle would seem to be good advice.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His purple, bloated face was captured by a photographer as paramedics rushed him to a New York hospital.Hours later, The Bureau of Prisons said he had died “from an apparent suicide”. His death came just over a month after he stepped off his private jet in New Jersey and was arrested by FBI agents. Epstein was charged with child sex trafficking offences.Prosecutors said the disgraced financier – jailed in  on child prostitution charges – had abused “dozens” of girls as young as . Victims revealed he would lure them to his home on the premise of giving him massages for money – before sexually abusing them behind closed doors.Judge Richard Berman denied Epstein bail – preventing him from plotting his defence from within the walls of his £million New York mansion.Speculation had turned to whether the ex-investment banker might co-operate with authorities. Big-name friends and associates might have had to give evidence – or be the subject of incriminating testimony from the girls Epstein allegedly abused.THE politan Correctional Center in the heart of Manhattan, New York, has been described as a “mini Guantanamo Bay” because it is so tough.It has formerly housed terrorists and Mexican drug lord El Chapo. Inmates in the jail’s Special Housing Unit where Epstein was held are kept in their tiny cells for  hours a day with the lights on at all times.Prisoners are only rarely allowed outside – in a cage on the roof. The notorious unit is said to be infested with rats and cockroaches. One former inmate at the prison, right, told the New York Post that it would have been “impossible” for Epstein to have hanged himself in his cell.He said: “You have sheets, but they’re paper level, not strong enough. He was  lbs – it would never happen.”ON July  –  days before his death – Epstein had been found curled up in the fetal position on the floor of his cell. One witness said he was “blue in the face” with bruising around his neck. Prison bosses suspected a suicide attempt.But they launched a probe to seehe had been attacked and even quizzed ex-cop Nicholas Tartaglione locked up in the jail on suspicion of killing four men. Another source said the incident could have been a ploy to get Epstein moved to a cushier jail.He was placed on suicide watch. Such prisoners are monitored. But just six days later – on July  – Epstein was taken off suicide watch. One source said Epstein’s lawyers asked for the change.He was put back in the Special Housing Unit and downgraded to “special observation status”, requiring two guards to check on him separately every  minutes. Epstein was also supposed to have a cell mate but was alone the night before he was found dead.His two guards reportedly fell asleep and failed to check on him. They also falsied records to cover up their error, sources told the New York Times. Both guards were working overtime. One was not even a corrections officer at the short-staffed jail.It was not the first time that the authorities had failed Epstein’s victims. His  conviction had been extremely lenient. Last year, it emerged that the US Attorney’s Office scrapped a -page indictment against Epstein, allowing him to plead guilty to minor state prostitution charges.He served  months in the private wing of a county jail and spent most of that on work release. Alex Acosta, who handled Epstein’s plea deal, resigned last month as US President Donald Trump’s Labor Secretary in the wake of the scandal.EPSTEIN had apparently hanged himself with a bedsheet. The office of New York City’s chief medical examiner, Barbara Sampson, completed an autopsy of Epstein’s body on Sunday.She found that he had suffered multiple breaks in his neck bones, deepening the mystery. Among them was the hyoid bone which is near the Adam’s apple. Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves but they are far more common in victims of murder by strangulation.Sampson listed the cause of his death as pending and is seeking further information. But authorities are still said to be confident that Epstein killed himself.IN the s, Prince Andrew was introduced to Epstein by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. The Duke of York, now , went to his private Caribbean island and attended celeb-filled dinner parties with Woody Allen at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion.In a  court affidavit, Epstein’s ex-masseuse Virginia Roberts claimed she was lent out to Prince Andrew for sex as a teen. A picture also emerged of Andrew with his arm round Virginia, then , in . Andrew has always vigorously denied the claims which were later struck from a court case by a judge.A statement from Buckingham Palace said: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is .”In , after Epstein had served time for child prostitution offences, Andrew was snapped speaking with him in New York. He strongly denied any wrongdoing but his role as a trade envoy was terminated.A friend of Maxwell’s told Vanity Fair this week that Epstein was videotaping everyone on his island as an insurance policy. Ex-US President Bill Clinton took trips on Epstein’s private jet – later dubbed the Lolita Express due to the alleged orgies on board – as did actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. Clinton recently said he and Epstein hadn’t spoken in “well over a decade”.US President Donald Trump re-tweeted a conspiracy theory that Clinton had Epstein killed. In , Trump praised Epstein, both inset: “He likes beautul women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”FOLLOWING his death, the criminal case against Epstein can no longer be pursued. But victims will now launch legal claims against his estate for a slice of his fortune.Jenner Araoz, , became the first to sue this week. She said she was just  when Epstein raped her. US Attorney General Bill Barr has also vowed to hunt down others involved with Epstein’s sex trafficking conspiracy.Investigators are thought to be focusing on allegations regarding his ex-lover Ghislaine Maxwell, . She has been accused of procuring underage girls for him. Maxwell has denied the claims. The elusive former socialite sold her New York townhouse in .She was spotted for the first time on Monday at a fast food joint in LA, reading a book titled The Secret Lives And Deaths Of CIA Operatives. Others accused of aiding Epstein include assistants Sarah Kellen, Lesley Groff, Nadia Marcinkova and Adriana Ross, who are alleged to have booked his massages with young girls.Those four were named in Epstein’s  prostitution case as “potential co-conspirators” – which saw him jailed but then go free. US prosecutors are also said to want to speak to Emmy Tayler, , from Oxford – referred to in court testimony as Maxwell’s “sex slave”.

Here was her chance to pay back Andrew for his years of support and to cement their status as a reunited couple.A senior royal insider says: “She wants to be his shoulder to cry on. She wants to be there for him in his hour of need.“She feels this is like the old days when they would take on the world together.”Behind the scenes, the Royal Family and staff, who call the pair the “royal odd couple”, are shocked by the twists and turns of the embattled twosome. Some courtiers are even asking the previously unthinkable question: Could Andrew and Fergie go public as a couple They are now not seeing anybody  and are desperate to keep their rekindled relationship under wraps.Indeed, for the visit to Balmoral last week, they flew there separately to avoid being pictured together.The charade saw Andrew take his private jet, while Fergie landed a day later on a commercial flight ahead of their daughters Beatrice and Eugenie.The Queen’s insistence on having them both there is a sign that she has given their relationship her approval and now sees them as a reunited family.This gives Fergie further confidence that she can re-establish herself in the royal fold.But despite being together privately, two pivotal figures in the Royal Family are putting the brakes on them going public — Prince Philip and future king Prince Charles.The staunch opposition has led to friends of Sarah and Andrew, both , having ided opinions about where the relationship is heading in the long term.Many feel the prospect of remarrying remains unlikely while Philip is around, despite his hostility towards Fergie thawing.Another royal insider says: “They could never remarry while Prince Philip is alive.“He is dead against Sarah and blames her for bringing shame on the royals in the Nineties.“He still won’t be in the same room as herhe can help it, but made an exception for the royal weddings last year.“The Queen has always had a soft spot for Sarah and says she has been a wonderful mother to Beatrice and Eugenie.“She accepts that they have turned out well because their parents have been together in all but name.”A major moment of national sadness could provide Fergie’s biggest window of opportunity.The insider adds: “When Philip has gone, it wouldn’t surprise methey remarry.“They have both been through a lot and many relationships but there is something between them, an unbreakable bond which keeps them close. It’s a shame they broke up in the first place.”But another royal source has a dferent take: “I don’t think they will ever remarry. The truth is that it suits Sarah to stay friendly with Andrew and it always has done.“He has bailed her out financially on numerous occasions. She would be broke without him. Her trouble is she is actually very generous,perhaps based on insecurity.“As soon as she has any money she buys people presents and it’s almost asshe’s buying love and affection.”Fergie has remained close to another former lover, the millionaire motorsports businessman Paddy McNally who was her first serious boyfriend. So an attachment to an ex is nothing new.But Philip does not understand why The Duke of York has never been able to distance himself from his ex-we.The source adds: “Fergie does exert some sort of hold over him however, and he seems too weak to let go.“Their daughters are now grown up, so they don’t have to live together. But he seems incapable of splitting up totally, which dismays Prince Philip, who can’t understand the set-up.“It’s been like this for years and I don’t see it changing any time soon.”Prince Charles is opposed to the idea of Fergie rejoining “the Firm”, believing she has brought embarrassment to the Royal Family.His relationship with younger brother Andrew has been strained as a result. They do not get on personally, perhaps triggered by Fergie siding with Princess Diana over Camilla.In her  book, Fergie says of Diana: “She was two years younger than I, and I strove to support and protect her as I would a younger sister — as I still do today, as a best friend.”Prince Harry is supportive of his aunt, who still has the title Duchess of York, given his close relationship with cousins Beatrice and Eugenie.And Prince William is also on board with her renaissance, despite failing to invite Fergie to his  wedding to Kate Middleton.But the other major fear within the royal camp is Fergie’s desire to make money off her royal position.It was revealed last week that she was handed almost £, from a firm chaired by Hong Kong businessman Dr Johnny Hon, as well as a £,-a-year retainer for her non-executive directorship of his film- investment company.According to multi-millionaire Dr Hon, Fergie’s role was introducing him to key contacts.As far back as January , she signed a £million deal to become a WeightWatchers ambassador in the US, having already appeared in commercials for fruit juice brands and Olympus cameras.She has also released  books, including Dieting With The Duchess in , and even got cameos in hit comedies Friends and The Vicar Of Dibley, playing herself. Cash from these jobs went some way in helping Andrew to clear the huge debts she racked up.Andrew, meanwhile, continues to enjoy an enviable lestyle courtesy of a trust fund set up for him as a child.There is also an annual allowance from the Queen via The Sovereign Grant, which also pays for staff costs his Royal Navy pension plus substantial investments in businesses and property.ITV’s Royal Editor Chris Ship was the first to reveal Andrew and Fergie were “back together” in April.But his bombshell story was officially denied by Fergie.Later that month, The Sun confirmed that the couple were back together in a romantic relationship which pals branded “friends with benefits”.Fergie had married Andrew in July  at Westminster Abbey, sealing the union with a kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace in front of , people.The couple announced their separation in  after Fergie was pictured topless and having her toes sucked by her American financial adviser John Bryan on holiday in France.Their orce was finalised four years later, with the Palace announcing that the duchess would no longer carry out public engagements on behalf of the Queen.These days the Yorks live together at the Royal Lodge in Windsor, but brought up their daughters in their official residence, Sunninghill Park in Berkshire, until .Just four years ago, Fergie described herself and Andrew as “the happiest orced couple in the world”, saying: “Extraordinary, really, isn’t it. We live in the same house, but then, it’s a big house, so that’s OK. But I think it’s really good that we believe in compromise and communication and compassion. And family.”Fergie also says of Andrew: “He’s still my handsome prince, he’ll always be my handsome prince.”In this extraordinary royal romance, the possibility can’t be ruled out.FERGIE is no stranger to embarrassing situations.In  she was pictured topless and having her toes sucked by her US financial adviser John Bryan in St Tropez.She used her links with the royals to sign a £.million contract with WeightWatchers in .And six months before Princess Diana died, Fergie claimed to have got a wart from shoes she had borrowed from her.She scaled back plans for lavish th birthday celebrations in  due to a lack of cash.After being snubbed from William and Kate’s wedding in , Fergie claimed: “I really love the feeling that sort of Diana and I both weren’t there.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

worth  million or £ million - has a private runway for his plane, dubbed the Lolita Express.The disgraced financier, , used his plane to fly in his powerful pals – and young girls to entertain them, court documents claim.Epstein’s alleged ‘sex slave’ Virginia Giuffre claimed she was lent out to the sex beasts influential pals when she was just .In a trove of court papers, released hours before Epstein’s jail suicide, Virginia claimed Prince Andrew visited the New Mexico ranch.She claims his visit came after she had sex with the royal at the London home of Epstein’s alleged ‘madam’ Ghislaine Maxwell in .Andrew has always vehemently denied the claims - which were struck from the record in  by a US judge who deemed them immaterial.A Buckingham Palace spokesman previously said: “This relates to proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party.“Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.“It is emphatically denied that the Duke had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts .“Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.”During a stay at the ranch, Virginia claims Epstein offered to pay her to have a baby that he and his Brit socialite lover could bring up.Epstein allegedly offered the teen a mansion and a monthly allowance to go through with the sordid deal, according to court papers.Virginia, who is now , alleges she was warnedshe ever left Epstein she would have to sign over the baby to him and his then-girlfriend Ghislaine.The allegations were made in a lawsuit filed in Florida in  but emerged after Epstein, , was charged with underage sex trafficking charges.Giuffre told lawyers: “He came up with a proposition that I thought was disgustingly sick.He offered me a mansion and money every month, a monthly allowance,to bear one of his children.The proposition was thatanything ever happened between Jeffrey and I, that I would have to sign my child over to him basically and that the child would be his and Ghislaine and I would be looking after it as nothing happened between Jeffrey and I.”It’s been claimed that the paedo confided in scientists that he planned to impregnate dozens of women at his New Mexico ranch.He wanted up to  women to be pregnant with his children at a time - in a bizarre sci-fi-like plot to improve the human race with his genes, the New York Times said.Multiple sources told the paper that convicted paedophile Epstein would boast of his sick plans at champagne-fuelled parties.The shamed financier apparently began sharing his vision for his ,sq ft Zorro Ranch in the early s.He would allegedly tell scientists and businessmen he wanted the vast New Mexico property to be turned into his own personal baby-making factory.There, women would be inseminated with his sperm and give birth to his babies, two top scientists and a leading business adviser told the Times.It was not clearEpsteins stranger-than-fiction dream would involve him having sex with the women or them being articially inseminated.Epstein told of the plot at least twice - at his Manhattan mansion in  and a luxury science conference he hosted in the Virgin Islands, its alleged.But the business adviser claimed he heard others discussing Epsteins apparent warped idea, the paper added - suggesting it was no secret.Computer scientist and writer Jaron Lanier told the Times he heard about the plot from a NASA scientist at an Epstein gathering in New York.Lanier said the scientist told him that Epstein was inspired by the controversial sperm bank the Repository for Germinal Choice in Calornia.It was stocked by high-achieving white males – reportedly including as many as five Nobel Prize winners – from  to .He was arrested on July ,  for sex trafficking minors in Florida and New York.Epstein was arrested on July ,  on sex trafficking charges.Court documents allege that at least  underage girls were brought to Epstein’s mansion for sexual encounters.He was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey.FBI agents are also said to have broken down the door to his Manhattan townhouse.He pleaded not guilty to child sex trafficking charges in New York and could face  years in prisonfound guilty.On July , a federal judge said that the disgraced financier presented a danger to the community and must stay in one of New Yorks toughest prisons while he awaits a trial over the sex trafficking accusations.The shamed financier was locked up amid fears he would flee the country.Epstein was also reportedly fascinated with the unproven science of cryogenics.It involves people’s bodies or body parts being frozen at very low temperatures in the hope they can be brought back to le in the future.According to another source, Epstein described wanting to have his penis and head cryogenically preserved.Mr Balderas has been in contact with prosecutors in New York, where Epstein has already been charged and is awaiting trial.Epstein, , was first convicted of underage sex offences in  when he agreed to a so-called ‘sweetheart deal’ in Florida.He admitted a single charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution in exchange for a  month jail sentence, and registering as a sex offender.Shortly after completing his sentence he bought the New Mexico ranch from the family of the late New Mexico governor Bruce King.Under New Mexico law he was not required to register as a sex offender there.According to local reports Epstein did voluntarily contact the sherfs office in Santa Fe when he bought the ranch, alerting them about his conviction.But the New Mexico Department of Public Safety then told him he did not need to.New Mexico attorney general Hector Balderas said the fact Epstein had not been required to register as a sex offender in the region was a huge black eye for our state."},{"url":null,"title":"brit trophy hunters safari extinction","story":"In Glastonbury, an ex gamekeepers company flogs holidays where hunters pay to kill threatened species including monkeys, elephants, giraffes and zebras.The Mirror revealed earlier this month that hunters can pay ProStalk £, extra to shoot a giraffe, £, for a hippo or £ for monkeys.The grim sport has been newly brought into focus as delegates from  countries meet in Geneva to consider proposals to protect threatened animals.There are currently no international trade rules that protect giraffes, meaning trophies can be exported and imported without checks.But a proposal by six African nations would mean records would have to be kept - and mean the sick sport would at least have to be monitored.Charlie Reynolds is one of a number of hunters who track down giraffes for pleasure - but he claims to be doing nature a favour.He told The Times how he followed a young giraffe around a ranch in South Africas Eastern Cape for a day before killing it with a single shot to the head.“It was dead before it hit the ground,” said Mr Reynolds, who said he was quite proud of the kill in , which cost him £.He made the kill on a trip organised by Umlilo Safaris, a South African company that offers trophy hunts and management hunts to shoot threatened species including elephants, rhinos, leopards and lions.Hunting and habitat loss contributing to giraffe numbers falling by  per cent to , in  -

Not for a moment did they envisage having to act on it.The letter was — like almost everything Mr Corbyn has ever said or done — about posturing rather than acting. The Labour leader spent  years as a backbencher before his elevation to being Leader of the Opposition.During those three decades he achieved precisely nothing.Had he not been elected leader, the few people to have been aware of his existence would have known him as a minor fringe MP who hung out with terrorists and racists.The sum total of his contribution to politics as a backbencher was to have proposed  Early Day Motions, the parliamentary equivalent of tweeting.Topics which he considered worth his time included “seal genitalia”, “Disney children’s pyjamas” and an MI proposal to use pigeons as flying bombs.Mr Corbyn’s natural disposition is to tear down, to criticise and to oppose.He could not even bring himself to support his own party when it was in power, voting against the last Labour government  times.There is not a single piece of legislation that owes anything to his contribution.This is the context in which his and Labour’s seemingly incoherent stance on Brexit — one day against another referendum, another day for one one day for Brexit, another day for Remain — must be seen.He is uninterested in the mechanics of a concrete solution. He has no real views on the details of Brexit or even how we get there.For Mr Corbyn, Brexit is a means to an end — which is as a vehicle to power.That is why, for example, he has on  occasions instructed Labour MPs either to abstain or to vote with the Government on Brexit, rather than attempting in any serious way to force the Government to change course, either over the type or Brexit on offer or a second referendum.He wants Brexit.He and his coterie of revolutionary socialists believe that leaving without a deal will be chaotic and that in that chaos Labour will be swept into office.But that, by definition, requires Brexit both to happen and to be chaotic.Most of his party take a dferent view — most are Remainers — so every so often the Corbynites view it as tactically wise to offer the appearance of wanting to work against the Government’s version of Brexit.Hence yesterday’s letter. But it is all meaningless posing. In her speech yesterday rejecting Mr Corbyn’s demand that she support him as PM, Jo Swinson hit the nail on the head.She said: “In my first week as leader of the Liberal Democrats I called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence in the Government and I asked him to table it before summer recess, because that was the only way to be sure we could hold an election before crashing out on the st of October.”You do not have to share Ms Swinson’s opposition to Brexit to accept that her analysis is spot on.Mr Corbyn refused to table such a vote of no confidence at the end of July. Had he actually wanted to avoid No Deal, he would have done.There was every chance Boris Johnson’s new government would have lost and we would now be in the middle of an election campaign.Whatever the outcome of that election, we would not — as we are now — be spending time analysing the prospects of a so-called government of national unity or looking at cynical letters written by the Labour leader.Mr Corbyn and his allies doubtless think they are being extremely clever, riding two horses at the same time.But his problem is that every time he opens his mouth, the unsuitability for office becomes ever clearer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wouldnt be able to support that, no.”But Sir Oliver did not rule out backing a no confidence motion in Boris Johnson’s administration to prevent a no-deal but added he would not back such a moveit meant Mr Corbyn became Prime Minister.He said: “Im not very inclined to do thatit could possibly be avoided - its not something I would do under any circumstances in normal le and Id much prefer to find some other means of getting to a substantive result.”Mr Corbyn had written to a number of senior Tories asking them for their support as a caretaker PMhe managed to topple Mr Johnson.Caroline Spelman, one of the other Tories who was targeted by the Labour leader, made it clear she would not vote against Mr Johnson in a vote of no confidence.Sir Oliver’s comments come after another rebel Tory MP Dominic Grieve backed down in giving help to the opposition.He wrote in a letter seen by the New Statesman which said he was “not about to facilitate Jeremy Corbyn’s arrival in Downing Street”.Former justice secretary David Gauke, another likely Remainer rebel, added: “If anyone thinks the answer is Jeremy Corbyn, I think they’re probably asking the wrong question.”Thank you for your letter.We agree that our common priority should be to work together in Parliament to prevent No Deal Brexit and welcome your invitation to discuss the dferent ways that this might be achieved.We would be happy to meet with you as well as colleagues from other opposition parties whenever convenient in the weeks before Parliament s.Yours sincerelyNick BolesDominic GrieveOliver LetwinCaroline SpelmanPhilip Hammond, the former Chancellor, also faced a backlash from the party after he launched an attack on Mr Johnson.He said leaving with No Deal would be a “betrayal” of the people and he was “very confident” that MPs would be able to team up and stop it in the weeks ahead.Tories hit back and accused him of undermining Britain’s negotiating position, and for making it even more likely the EU would give us nothing.And one Tory, Guto Bebb, said that “a short term Jeremy Corbyn government is less damaging… than a No Deal Brexit.”A source at Sir Oliver’s West Dorset Conservative Association said: “We are completely at odds with our MP over this.”In Mr Grieve’s constituency, association chairman Jackson Ng said he’d been inundated with irate calls from members – and said his behaviour was “un-Conservative”.“Should he entertain the idea of siding with Jeremy Corbyn or any other Government other than the existing Conservative Government currently being led by Boris Johnson, he will leave us no choice at all as an Association,” he warned.Tory MP Steve Double added earlier: “Does anyone actually think once Jeremy Corbyn was in No he will be easy to remove  He would have all the machinery of government behind him  would fight an election as PM. Remember no one thought he would win the Labour leadership. This is a dangerous game some are playing.”And Assembly Member Gareth Bacon added: “Unbelievable.

Today flowers were laid at the scene of the killing in Berkshire. A witness told the Daily Mail that they saw a fellow officer crouched over  PC Harper. They said: The officeraposs crewmate was shouting, saying aposstay with me, stay with me. Keep breathingapos.  PC Harper died from his injuries after reportedly being dragged under a aposgetawayapos van at about .pm on Thursday at the village of Sulhamstead in Berkshire. Thames Valley Police said  boys and men aged between  and  have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are in custody at ious police stations in the force area. An emergency call was made reporting a burglary at a residential property at .pm on Thursday, said Thames Valley Police spokesman Jack Abell. An officer on duty with PC Harper was not physically injured but is being provided with emotional support, he added. Police are currently focusing their inquiries on one vehicle, understood to be a Seat. The police cordon has been extended by around  metres as around  white-suited forensics officers conduct a sweep of the area. Chief Constable John Campbell said PC Harper was at the scene with a fellow officer and was out of his police car when the incident occurred, adding: What we do know is Andrew had been dragged along by a vehicle. He said the suspects were detained within about an hour of the incident and officers are working hard and diligently to find out what happened. A post-mortem examination is taking place to establish the cause of death.  Mr Campbell added that PC Harper joined as a special constable in  before becoming a police officer a year later, serving in the Roads Policing Proactive Unit based at Abingdon Police Station. He added that the officer only married four weeks ago, and pictures show PC Harper and his new we Lissie celebrating their wedding at the award-winning stately venue Ardington House, a Georgian manor in Oxfordshire set in gardens and parkland. Relatives described the day as a dream wedding. Mr Campbell said Pc Harper was a highly regarded, popular member of the team, adding: Everybody Iaposve spoken to about Andrew talked about the incredible personality he was, what a fantastic police officer, and what a great friend and man he was, and heaposll be sorely missed by everybody.  Mr Campbell said: My thanks go to all those staff and officers who attended this incident, as well as our colleagues at the fire service and also the ambulance service for their professionalism and support at what you can imagine was obviously a distressing scene. He said the forceaposs flags are flying at half mast as a sign of respect in honour and memory of Andrew. The incident took place at the crossroads of Ufton Lane and Lambdens Hill, near to the village of Sulhamstead - near Bucklebury where Carole and Michael Middleton, the mother and father of the Duchess of Cambridge, live. On Friday, forensic investigators could be seen gathering items that lay on the road and taking photographs, and two white tents were erected. Police were also seen searching the inside of a grey BMW that was at the scene, according to witnesses.  Pictures of the scene show a blood trail on the road leading across the junction. Police officers laid two bunches of flowers inside the cordon, while other officers guarded the perimeter. On Friday evening there was a police presence at a caravan site near Burghfield Common, not far from where the incident took place. PC Harper is the first officer to be killed on duty since March , when unarmed Pc Keith Palmer was stabbed by Khalid Masood during the Westminster Bridge terror attack. The incident comes after a police constable was run over by a suspected car thief in Birmingham last week. The married -year-old traffic officer from West Midlands Police is facing potentially le-changing injuries, a senior officer told the PA news agency.  This came just days after politan Police constable Stuart Outten, , was left with head and hand injuries after challenging a motor offences suspect allegedly armed with a machete in Leyton, east London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a mindless and brutal crime, saying he was shocked and appalled by the attack. Mr Johnsonaposs comments followed his pledge to hire , more police officers and an announcement of a range of investments to boost the criminal justice system. He also vowed to see violent offenders locked up for longer as a result of an urgent review of sentencing laws. Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for the Thames Valley, Matthew Barber, said the incident raises the issue of whether officers should be routinely armed. Speaking to BBC Radio  Liveaposs Stephen Nolan, he said: Undoubtedly this has raised the issue of arming police routinely. I think we need to await the outcome of this investigation, itaposs not clear at the moment whether that would have made any dference in these circumstances anyway. I think one of the great things about British policing is that officers arenapost routinely armed. Thataposs obviously a point for discussion going forward.

A judge found the couple benefited from crime to the tune of around £,. They spent that sum in around five years, police said. Prosecutors will now try to claw back some of the cash through a Proceeds of Crime investigation. Henry Blackshaw, prosecuting, said the Clayton couple were ‘living well on the back of criminality’. He said the pair spent ‘extravagantly’, holidaying in Cancun, Gran Canaria, Bulgaria and buying BMWs, Audis and Mercedes cars. Coleen worked part-time at Matalan and received working tax credits.

Skies will start clearing from Monday, with warm air arriving by midweek, the Met Office says. It will be a welcome change for Brits who have had to put up with a storm-hit August which could be on track to be the wettest for seven years. The Met Office has forecast C sunny spells in the South and East at the start of the week, with C on the cards by the long weekend. High pressure is set to bring subtropical air from the Azores, while the North and West will still see showers at times. The Met Office forecasts three weeks of mainly warm and dry conditions for many for the last week of August and first half of September.    And ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond, of weathertrending, said temperatures could push C. He said: Summer lurched from hot to cool and wet, but warmer weather in time for the Bank Holiday will lt the mood of weather-beaten Brits. Temperatures should be not far from C for some at the end of August. Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: Thereaposs an improvement after wet and windy weather, with plenty of sunny spells through the next week and C possible by the Bank Holiday weekend. Low pressure clears from Monday and high pressure slowly builds, with a southerly flow possible, with fewer showers in the South and East while the North and West remain less settled.    High pressure looks like dominating in the last week of August, with mainly settled conditions and the mid-s possible. That is likely to continue into September, his Met Office colleague Sarah Kent continued. She said: August  to September  has signs high pressure will increasingly dominate. Temperatures are likely to be warmer than average.  The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “August has been shocking but summer is poised to be rescued by high pressure pulling up subtropical air from the Azores by the Bank Holiday weekend. “Highs approaching C are expected into September.”  With rainfall to add from Fridayaposs deluge and the second half of August, a total of over mm would make this summer the wettest since aposs wettest summer for  years, when mm fell.  James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, said: The second half of August is likely to deliver a much more settled weather pattern compared to what we have seen over the past few days. While above-average temperatures are expected through the run up to September, it will only take a small nudge in the right direction for Britain to get something much hotter.

The clan are the descendants of Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart , and are worth a combined wealth of about  billion - or £ billion. He and his we, Helen, had four children - Rob, John, Jim and Alice, all of whom are billionaires. After Samaposs death in , Rob took over as chairman, while John served as a director before dying in a plane crash in the mid-s. Jim and Alice are not directly involved in the running of the company - although Jimaposs son, Steuart is on the board.

He allegedly only flew first class once in his le, and lived in a modest home, driving a beaten-up red truck. Rob, his eldest child, seems to be more happy to splash his cash. According to Business Insider , he owns a collection of expensive vintage cars , and in  he managed to wreck an ultra-rare Daytona Coupe, which was thought to be worth £. million.    When John Walton died in a plane crash in , he left around  per cent of his fortune to we, Christy, with the rest going to an assortment of charities and his son, Lukas. Jim Walton, , who is married to Lynne McNabb Walton, holds an estimated net worth of £. billion. Jim and Lynne have four children — Alice A Proietti, Thomas L Walton, James M Walton and Steuart Walton. The latter is one of the companyaposs directors and married Baywatch star Kelly Rohrbach earlier this year.  He and his brother, Thomas are reportedly avid mountain bikers, and together they co-founded an investment company, RZC Investments. Alice Walton has a fortune of around £ billion.

Sharon tate was married to acclaimed director, Roman Polanski, and had just earned her first Golden Globe nomination for her role in Valley Of The Dolls. But then, on August , , she was stabbed to death in her own home alongside dinner guests and friends by Charles Mansonaposs family. The -year-old is reported to have pleaded to be taken as a hostage and kept alive for long enough for her baby to be born. Her desperate requests fell on deaf ears and Tate was brutally stabbed  times and strangled.    Tate, who is portrayed by Margot Robbie in the new Quentin Tarantino film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, was renowned for her doe-eyes and comic film roles. She first appeared on film in Barbabbas in  but it was five years until she made her next movie, Eye Of The Devil. The Fearless Vampire Killers, directed by her husband-to-be saw Tate don a red wig. Despite his harsh words during early filming, Polanski was impressed with tateaposs performance and the pair began a relationship. Next she made Donapost Make Waves with icon, Tony Curtis, and then came her major role in Valley Of The Dolls.    Tate was nominated for a Golden Globe for her work on the film. Next she shot The Wrecking Crew with Dean Martin and even performed her own martial arts stunts. Towards the end of , Tate fell pregnant and moved into the house in Cielo Drive, Los Angeles. This was a decision that would ultimately cost her her le. But despite being married and pregnant, Tateaposs le was anything but surburban.    While she may have wanted a traditional marriage, she had promised not to try to change her husband, who was said to be promiscious. One biography claims that tate was often cheated on by Polanski, who also persuaded her to make home-made sex films and take part in threesomes. When she was a young struggling actress, Tate is believed to have dated Richard Beymer, who was  years older than her. And she was once engaged to actor Philippe Forquet, who it is claimed had a temper. Tate is rumoured to have been beaten by her lover and is even said to have once stabbed him in the chest with a wine bottle.    Great Escape legend Steve McQueen is also rumoured to have had a relationship with Tate before she started dating hairdress Jay Sebring, who was killed alongside her by Mansonaposs followers. Their relationship ended when she started seeing Polanski while he was directing her. Urban legend claims he made her re-shoot a scene in The Fearless Vampire KIllers  times before he was happy with it. Tate also appeared naked on screen in the movie, something that was still considered controversial in the s. Ed Sanders, the biographer who wrote Sharon Tate: A Le, claims that Polanski liked to hold orgies at the home he shared with his we in LA.    He would film these sex parties and then play the tapes at parties with his famous pals. Polanski is also said to have tried to control what Tate wore. Then, on August , , Tateaposs le ended in the most horric way. Each of the murders was brutal -  Jay was was shot after he tried to stop the gang attacking Sharon and then stabbed seven times. Steven Parent, a friend of the houseaposs caretaker, was shot and killed as The Family, minus Charles, burst into the home in Los Angeles.    He was just . Wojciech was asleep on the sofa when The Family barged in and was kicked in the head by Tex Watson. When Wojciech asked him what he was doing he chillingly replied I am the devil and Iaposm here to do the devilaposs business. Watson then started to tie Sharon and Jay together with a rope round their necks and slung it over the beam in the living room. Abigail was ordered into the bedroom to get her purse and handed  over to The Family.    She managed to flee out of a bedroom door but was followed by Patricia Krenwinkel, who caught her and stabbed her. But worse was the come for Abigail who was eventually killed by Watson, who stabbed her  times. Wojciechaposs hands had been bound by a towel but he managed to free himself and started to struggle with Atkins. She kept stabbing at his legs but as he struggled out of the house, he was caught by Watson and hit over the head with a gun. He was then stabbed multiple times, shot twice but still fought to escape the house.    Wojciech was eventually killed when he was stabbed  times. Sharon herself was stabbed many times in the chest and strangled. Her mutilated and broken body was found with the cord used in the killing still around her neck. Tragically, her baby - due to be born within weeks - did not survive the horric injuries suffered by his mother. Meanwhile, Sharon was desperately not only fighting for her own le but also that of her unborn baby.    The -year-old actress made the ultimate sacrice to keep herself alive for long enough for her baby to be born. She offered herself up as a hostage - her pleas fell on deaf ears. Itaposs not clearWatson or Atkins stabbed Tate and delivered the fatal blow. But she was kned  times and as she was being attacked she cried out mother... mother. Once the killers had butchered their victims, they used the bloody towel that had bound Wojciechaposs hands to write the word apospigapos on the front door of Sharonaposs home in blood.    Just a day after the Tate murder, The Family struck again. Supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his we, Rosemary, were killed at their home in LA. Officers did not link the two crime scenes. Then, in December , members of the Manson Family were arrested for a series of car thefts and while she was in custody she told her fellow prisoners of the other crimes she had been involved in - including the murders.

The post encourages people to ask Google why Corn Flakes were invented, adding: You will thank me later.So many people began enquiring about the creation of the humble corn flake only to discover something pretty shocking.     John Kellogg, a physician, and anti-sex campaigner is said to have believed that eating a bland diet would help reduce sexual urges. Thus some people think his Corn Flakes, being bland, were developed to stop people from experiencing these urges and pleasuring themselves.This unusual theory has recently resurfaced in a new book by Kate Devlin called Turned On: Science Sex and Robots, where itaposs claimed the breakfast was invented as an anti-masturbatory morning meal.However, before you got telling all your friends, it seems that this might not quite be the case.   After bizarre theories about Corn Flakes began to swirl online, fact-checking resource Snopes decided to do a little digging.They say that the aposanti-masturbatoryapos claims are mostly  - as Kellogg never specically advertised the cereal in this way. In a post on their site, they explain: The creation of Corn Flakes was part of J.H. Kelloggaposs broader advocacy for a plain, bland diet. Without referring to Corn Flakes in particular, Kellogg where recommended a plain, bland diet as one of several methods to discourage masturbation. They added: According to the available evidence, Corn Flakes were primary created as an easy-to-digest, pre-prepared and healthy breakfast food, in particular for patients at the Kellogg sanitarium in Michigan. The product was never advertised as an aposanti-masturbatory morning mealapos.[The phrase] originated instead with a  article by Mental Floss, which  reported  that aposKellogg developed a few dferent flaked grain breakfast cereals — including corn flakes — as healthy, ready-to-eat anti-masturbatory morning meals.aposWhether or not itaposs true, we can probably all agree that thereaposs nothing particularly sexy about Corn Flakes as Devlin hilariously points out in her book: Having visited a Corn Flakes factory, I can confirm that it was one of the least arousing places I have ever been.

Red Square was packed. The crowd stared at a huge screen. As on every New Year’s Eve, they were straining to hear the annual presidential message. Boris Yeltsin, his speech slurred either due to his heart condition or alcohol, rarely disappointed. But as the new millennium dawned, he did just that. Instead of Yeltsin, an awkward bureaucrat filled the screen. He wore the kind of ill-fitting suit that was a hallmark of the Russian secret police, the KGB. The man explained that President Yeltsin had asked him to take over his duties. The speech continued in such a wooden manner, it could have been an episode of Thunderbirds. In his late s, the civil servant tried to reassure his audience. He promised that as acting President, he would uphold the rule of law, freedom of speech and the right to private property.  This man, Vladimir Putin, had been appointed Prime Minister the previous August,  years ago this week. After studying law in his native Leningrad , Putin joined the KGB and for five years in the s was stationed in Dresden where he lived with his we, Lyudmila and his two daughters. The marriage lasted  years before Putin confirmed their orce in . But in  few Russians recognised him or even knew who he was. Boris Berezovsky and his small band of super-wealthy oligarchs had steered Putin’s passage through the Kremlin corridors. They were all convinced that once Putin assumed the presidency, he would do their bidding, just as Yeltsin had. Two decades on, most of those oligarchs are dead or in exile fearing for their lives. And the President himself  In terms of both longevity in office and influence, he is on a par with Russia’s three overwhelming leaders: Peter the Great, ­Catherine the Great and Joseph Stalin. He is virtually unchallenged within Russia and outside he strolls around the global stage like a Marvel comic hero.  The original political Iron Man, he fashioned a system dubbed by one of his admirers as an “illiberal democracy”. His tough-guy image has spawned wannabes as far apart as Brazil and Turkey.Just over a year ago he held a summit in Helsinki with President Trump. The body language spoke volumes. In the US, the thin-skinned Mr Trump unleashes intemperate Twitter attacks against anyone who has offended him.But with Putin, Trump was fawning. He readily accepted Putin’s assurances that Russia had not interfered in the US elections of  despite the clear insistence of the FBI, the CIA and Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, that there was massive interference. A narcissist such as Trump is putty in the hands of an ­experienced KGB officer like Putin, whose achievements are remarkable given that Russia has an economy which is  times smaller than that of the United States. It’s only half the size of Brexit-battered Britain and yet Putin is now one of the most powerful and, many believe, richest men on the planet. Although he stands at just ft in, exactly the same height as Napoleon, in Russia Putin has carefully cultivated the image of the tough guy: releasing photos of him fishing with no shirt on, riding motorbikes and hunting bears. Early on in the presidency, Putin found himself in a battle with the oligarchs, notably Boris Berezovsky. Until then the super-rich had controlled presidents. Putin flipped that around, using all the tricks in the KGB playbook: arrest,  corruption charges, murder and bribery.  When Berezovsky continued to organise political resistance to Putin from his refuge in Britain, the Russian secret service went into overdrive. Up to  Russian and British associates of Berezovsky have since died, including the oligarch himself, in the murkiest of circumstances. After asserting domestic authority, Putin focused on foreign policy. In , he used the constitutional crisis in neighbouring Ukraine to move troops into Crimea in clear violation of international law. This was followed by the occupation of large tracts of eastern Ukraine by volunteers and mercenaries. Seizing parts of Ukraine proved popular among ordinary Russians. But provoked a reaction in the West. The EU and the US imposed sanctions on Russia, hampering investment in the country’s main sources of revenue: gas and oil. Given the structural weakness of the Russian economy, Putin realised he had limited options to fight the sanctions. So, Russia expanded its covert activities designed to unsettle the West. Centred around a cyber criminal community and a successful Moscow troll farm, Russia began a co-ordinated programme of spreading fake news in advance of the Brexit referendum, the  US presidential election and polls in Germany, France and Italy.Putin has extended the hand of friendship to Turkey, Israel and EU member, Hungary. This has contributed to political chaos in the West which is now less able to formulate coherent policies to counter Russian influence from Venezuela to Eastern Europe and the Middle East.It has been Putin’s masterstroke. In terms of political tactics, Trump and new PM Boris Johnson are minnows in comparison. But in the long term Despite projecting the strong-man image, Putin now faces an array of domestic problems. In Moscow and other cities, people are taking to the streets, furious at the corrupt networks which suck in the country’s riches. Damaging fires sweep across Siberia, exposing the weakness of the Russian government’s response. Just last week, a mysterious nuclear explosion occurred in the north of Russia. Some have compared it to the  nuclear disaster at Chernobyl.

It is believed that some of the crowd control devices are capable of emitting electric shocks in a bid to neutralise any perceived threat.  The ft poles with U-shaped prongs on the top are being used by both police and armed forces in practice drills as they prepare to enter Hong Kong. Rising tensions in the area have seen thousands of Hong Kong protesters take over the cityaposs airport.  The protesters, who have five demands, even stopped planes arriving or departing for an entire day. The unrest, now in its th week, shows no sign of easing – and there were ugly scenes as riot police clashed with the crowds earlier this week. In an emotional appeal, Hong Kongaposs leader Carrie Lam begged thousands of anti-government activists ­occupying the airport to leave after flights were seriously disrupted for a second day. Hundreds of members of Chinaaposs paramilitary forces conducted exercises at a sports stadium amid fears they could be sent to Hong Kong to break up the protests.  Chinaaposs military had issued a stark warning in a bid to intimidate protesters, saying troops could meet the demonstrators in  minutes, while sharing a photo of a queue of armoured vehicles. The control weapons, which potentially have the ability to shock people, have been part of the training.  Amnesty International said: A wide range of direct contact electric shock weapons including electric shock stun guns, stun batons and stun shields have been developed, traded and employed by police and security forces throughout the world. The use of such weapons results in intense, both localised and general pain but not incapacitation of the subject.

Millions of rodents are increasingly targeting the birds and their young, prompting scientists to give them the chilling name. The terror is being unleashed on Marion Island, in the southern Indian Ocean between the southern tip of Africa and Antarctica. It has become such a big problem that conservationalists are attempting to wipe them out. Stunned experts have voiced their shock at discovering the predators were striking under the cover of darkness.Andrea Angel, of Birdle South Africa , told News : I donapost think Iaposve ever seen anything so gruesome.   Attacks on nesting albatross and their chicks have increased in recent years, and Angel said she was revolted. She stated: Ravenous with hunger, the mice on Marion began to attack the nesting albatross – adults and chicks. There are millions of mice. Although they normally eat grain, seeds and small insects, attacks on the large birds have now become commonplace. Scientists believe the soaring winter temperature is to blame for more mice surviving, making them less discerning about what they eat. The mice, Angel said, are beyond starving.

the sides prepare for cup tie","story":"Dundee host Aberdeen in the Betfred Cup on Sunday and, eventhe Dons have had a few early season problems, it’s fair to say anything other than a win for them would be a shock.On the back of relegation, James McPake’s Dark Blues are finding their feet after a major overhaul of the squad during the summer.It means they go into this tie as major underdogs, though history does tell us this is a competition in which Dundee are capable of upsetting the odds.Tonight Tele Sport looks back at a couple of occasions when they have – and some others when the result has been true to the form book.While unlike the present format, this tie was over two legs, it was similar to this clash in that Dundee had just been relegated at the end of the previous season.Aberdeen were at the peak of their powers under Alex Ferguson and, as reigning champions, a bigger knockout tie for them was a European Cup meeting with Liverpool around the same time.That they went out of that competition to the team that would eventually win it was no great surprise but losing to Dundee was.After a draw at Dens in the first leg, the feeling was Donald Mackay’s team were heading to the Granite City hoping for little more than to keep the score respectable.In the end, however, a battling performance saw them hold their own and progress to the semi-finals thanks to a Cammy Fraser strike.Dundee would go on to make the final before losing to city rivals United on a historic day at Dens Park.The only time the north-east rivals have faced up in a national final and it was Aberdeen who lted the trophy with a comfortable Hampden victory.Once again, the pair met with Dundee, under Jim Duffy, out of the top flight but going into the tie on the back of a fine unbeaten run that saw them riding high in the First Division and making the final.For those of a Dark Blue persuasion, however, it quickly became a day to forget as their team didn’t really show up.An effort from former Dens favourite Billy Dodds had Aberdeen ahead by the break and, when Duncan Shearer added a second right at the start of the second half, it was all over bar the shouting.Although Dundee were again in the second tier, with the backing of Aberdeen-based businessman Callum Melville, their strong line-up was always going to provide a stern test for the visiting Dons.So it proved as, despite losing experienced goalkeeper Rab Douglas through injury in the first half, Jocky Scott’s team pulled off the result of the round by winning in extra-time.Goals from Eddie Malone and Craig Forsyth had the home team apparently cruising but a double from Michael Paton saw the proceedings heading into extra-time.As the game ebbed and flowed, one of those Melville-backed signings, a young Leigh Grfiths, came up trumps with the winner.The last time the teams met in a League Cup tie saw Dundee still recovering from a second period of administration that had seen the team almost fold the previous year.Having performed a miracle in keeping the team in the First Division in the   season, boss Barry Smith was looking to pull off a shock at Pittodrie.They battled hard to give him the scalp he wanted but, on the night, came up just short.A tight tie was decided as early as the th minute when home attacker Darren Mackie grabbed the only goal."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/27lgjmusic1.jpg ","title":"council to put dundee music centre on the market for 250000","story":"Music tuition in Dundee will continue unimpeded despite the intention to sell Bell Street Music Centre, council bosses have vowed.Dundee City Council is set to list the four-floor music centre – which boasts a first-floor performance hall – for sale in the coming days.The centre has been the city’s home of public music tuition for decades, with records showing its use as far back as the s.As recently as June the venue has been used for community concerts, such as that staged by the Help For Kids choir supported by the Eveningand Overgate.However, the local authority has drawn up plans to sell the local facility, along with a number of other public buildings, in a bid to cut down on maintenance costs.An advance notice touts the building as a “development opportunity” with a price tag of £,.“The main building was originally designed as a church and has more recently been used as a music centre with the outstanding feature being the large performance hall at first floor level,” it reads.A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council said: “The provision of music tuition will be unaffected by the sale of Bell Street Music Centre.“Music tuition will continue at alternate sites throughout the city.”The spokeswoman declined to elaborate on where these may be.However, it is likely the council will look to harness the facilities in its newer school buildings under its  Schools initiative.The Bell Street plan is part of the council’s “property rationalisation” scheme, drawn up to reduce its real estate footprint.Among the other buildings set for redundancy are Claverhouse Social Work Office, Dudhope Castle and a former Technology Park lab.The costs of keeping surplus properties has contributed to a £. million overspend in the council’s city development budget.Earlier this week the Tele reported the council had sold and leased back its own HQ to a Canadian firm to balance its books.Finance boss Greg Colgan’s latest financial assessment concludes: “Property rationalisation . . . will lead to properties being vacated thus generating revenue savings . . . and the possibility of a capital receipt from a sale of the asset.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special. While McAndrew has the harmonic range, Smalls almost monotoned meanderings, accompanied by the backing vocals of Grant Pringle and Cameron Jack, creates the rawest of emotions.Concluding the new EP is the orchestral art-song, A Theory of Everything. Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace. For the imprints you leave, have changed the fabric of time and space.If there is any justice in the supersonic space-age future, Electron Masss four EPs will hopefully have changed the fabric of

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use.

This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire. Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic.... We anticipate Levenseat will determine the best routes over the coming weeks.An SBC spokesperson added: ldquoThe number of trips to the waste transfer station is largely in line with trips to the previous landfill site, and signicantly less than could have been generated by an integrated waste management facility at Easter Langlee.ldquoAs part of the planning application which was approved in November , the council committed to improving the road network through additional street-lighting, better signage, localised road widening and removal of trees and vegetation, all of which have taken place.ldquoThe council was not able to define a route during the planning process as the procurement exercise had not been completed and therefore SBC did not know the end destination or the preferred route.ldquoThe new residual waste contract will see the majority of the waste treated to produce a refuse derived fuel ndash to generate heat and electricity ndash as well as recover materials which can be recycled.ldquoThe closure of the landfill site and opening of waste transfer station will also see a reduction in harmful greenhouse gases from landfilling the waste and we believe it will also result in an improved recycling performance."},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-set-17th-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock this weekend as it welcomes musicians, dancers and performers to the towns th annual music festival.The StRonans Hotel and Live  Local at the Vale Club have put together a jam-packed programme of bands overthree days.And the Church of Scotland, Tweedside Hotel, Masons Club and the Union Club are all set to host a number of events.The music kicks off on Friday at pm in the St Ronanrsquos Hotel with the Redwood Rejects, at pm with Fin Price at lsquoLive  Localrsquo and at pm with Sparky  The Choirboys at the Tweedside Hotel.On Saturday, alongside the full programmes of bands around Innerleithen, the town is packed with events, starting with the St Ronanrsquos Silver Band coffee morning.Afterwards, the band will be continuing their eight-hour sponsored play out and about in the town.At the Church of Scotland therersquos concerts galore with The Taylor Family  Friends, Borders piper Matt Seattle accompanied by guitarist Donald Knox, and superb Innerleithen-born singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby.Over at the Masons, the regions favourite cover band The Derivatives are appearing, while Rory Speirs is at the Tweedside.There will be something for all the family to enjoy, with a wide selection of workshops, including beginnerrsquos ballet and line dance with the Fiona Henderson School of Dance, as well as singing, belly-dancing and an introduction to ukelele.There will also be an opportunity to learn more about the town on a historical walk with local experts from the Innerleithen Community Trust.Sunday sees the music continue over at the Church of Scotland, with a concert by leading Scots folk singer Christine Kydd, supported by the Borders Gaelic singing group lsquoTurasrsquo and Folksters.And to round off the weekend, therersquos informal music sessions at the Gordon Arms and the Corner House hotels.One of the festivals organisers, Robin Dempsey said: ldquoWe are really excited that we have possibly our biggest ever line up, with around  performances and events on the programme, spread over eight venues.ldquoThe music festival is truly encouraging local talent in the community and it is great to see so many locals and visitors coming together to share their love of music.ldquoWhat has really helped this year is support from our new sponsor, private development group, Whiteburn, who are currently regenerating the former Caerlee Mill site in the town.

This is standard, legal practice. Safety is our number one priority when arranging home to school transport.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe are working with colleagues across the council and in schools to ensure that all pupils who have been issued with a bus pass are on the transport providersrsquo lists and to improve access to the school transport timetables.ldquoWe recognise that this may have caused uncertainty for parents, carers and pupils.ldquoOur staff and the transport providers will continue to work closely together to manage the transition to these new arrangements.Councillor Craig Hoy, ward member, said: ldquoI was relieved to get clear reassurance from council staff on the issues of vehicle safety and the safety of children travelling from Gford and outlying areas to Knox Academy.ldquoItrsquos clear that there were communications problems which impacted parents and pupils.

spin no deposit bonuses over the last few years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The ,-capacity venue, one of the best-known in Britain, with a giant neon sign that has become a landmark, has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan to REM, U, David Bowie and Oasis. Next to it lies the Barras, the famed open-air weekend market. All around are pubs, shops and restaurants. An adult shop sits just opposite.This is a street that stirs all sorts of opinions, some of them fairer than others. \"A walk up the Gallowgate ndash takeaways, pawnshops and Celtic pubs ahoy ndash can feel a bit dicey on occasion, but its all part of the Barrowlands experience,\" an English newspaper noted a few years ago. \"A dingy red-light area of Glasgow,\" one architecture magazine said disapprovingly, back in .An encyclopedia of Scotland notes that Gallowgate retained \"much of its distinctive earthy charm\" despite wholesale demolition and regeneration. \"This part of town is gritty, and a far cry from the historical tenement buildings of the centre, but it gives you a taste of the citys authentic character,\" observed the Dubai-based Business Traveller Middle East in .Relive the Roaring Twenties - The Ivy, Glasgow: restaurant review by Ron MackennaGoing back even further, the Edinburgh-born novelist Naomi Mitchison, in her notes for a post-war novel, wrote impatiently of the Gallowgate: \"Notice how many children you see with obvious rickets, impetigo or heads close clipped for lice see the wild, slippered, sluts, not caring anymore to look decent!\"You get the picture.But things are changing. The area is increasingly home to creative businesses and a new generation of pubs and restaurants. The Creative East End organisation is one such based at  Gallowgate, and led by Lauren Stewart and Jen McGlone, it provides space for initiatives and ideas to flourish in the interests of economic growth and regeneration. Over at Calton Entry, the thriving BAaD - Barras Art and Design - includes a fish restaurant, AChalltainn, as well as concerts and a Sunday indoor market.Just next to the Barrowland lies what was once a well-known Celtic pub. Bairds Bar, it was called: here,  years ago, the then interim Celtic manager Kenny Dalglish held one of the more unusual press conferences in the clubs history. Bairds was shut down amid ious well-publicised dficulties in , but recently it was reopened as a restaurant,  Gallowgate, which has been praised by none other than the Herald on Sundays exacting restaurant critic, Joanna Blythman. \"The people who opened  Gallowgate,\" read her concluding paragraph, seem to get old Glasgow, its mood, its character, its value.\"In Bain Street, close by the Barrowland, there is Saint Lukes, a noted live-music venue, and the award-winning Winged Ox Bar  Kitchen. Other key local venues are the Van Winkle Bourbon BBQ Grill, at  and the award-winning pub. Hielan Jessie, at . WEST Brewery, at the Templeton Building on Glasgow Green, has been flying the flag for the east end for  years.Something, it seems, is stirring in the Gallowgate.Cross the road from the Barrowland and, next door to the adult shop youll see another new venture: The Gate, a lounge bar, a \"modern Scottish pub\", the brainchild of Andy Gemmell, a well-known drinks consultant who is also a columnist on the Herald on Sundays Scottish Le magazine.Together with Tom Joyes, general manager of the Barrowland, Gemmell discloses plans to rebrand the area as the East End Quarter - to, in their words, \"create the visual reason for people to visit East and make it a must-visit neighbourhood in Glasgow.\":The  best seaside pubs in ScotlandMore of The Gate first, though. Its hard to miss, with a vivid yellow diagonal stripe across its facade and front door. It occupies a site that, from next year, will have been home to a remarkable succession of Gallowgate watering-holes for  years. Its quite a thought: since , the year of Scotlands short-lived Radical War, locals have been knocking back beer and whisky in industrial quantities in this very space. Its more recent inhabitants included The Haven, and The Emerald Isle.Gemmell, whose CV has seen him work in award-winning bars and travel the world as a whisky ambassador, speaks with some pride of the history of these premises the fact, for example, that when you enter them, youre in the original close of a tenement that once loomed over the Gallowgate, two centuries ago. Faded uncovered signs, advertising long-forgotten businesses that once traded here, can also be glimpsed.Gemmell knows the area well. His previous role ndash the marketing consultancy, The Drink Cabinet ndash was one of the many businesses based round the corner in East Campbell Street, at the Glasgow Collective, whose founders, brothers John and David McBeth, were, he says, the first to bring a creative side to the Gallowgate. .\"Their premise was to bring young, up-and-coming businesses into the area. Its that basic equation that we see, for example, in Hoxton or Shoreditch [in Londons East End] ndash affordable business space for younger people. I fell in love with the area after that. Its had its issues, its troubles and everything , but I just fell in love with it.\"Three years ago this place came up for sale. It was a good price, and I saw the opportunity. Everyone thought I was mad.\" Why  \"Because of its general reputation, which I felt was exaggerated peoples perception of the area was always asthere was an invisible force-field when you get to The Tron [on the other side of Glasgow Cross from the Gallowgate].\"He notes that both the Trongate and the adjacent Merchant City have been flourishing in terms of bars and entertainment, but laments that \"a stigma\" has attached itself to the Gallowgate. \"There are lots of factors that have given rise to this,\" he argues, \"but people have highlighted these rather than looking at the positives of an amazing village in the middle of Glasgow city centre, with amazing people in it as well. Incredible people. I felt the area has what it takes to be an exciting hub for the city,\"The premises were sitting in now were in a neglected condition when he first saw it. There were, for example, six dferent ceilings, all layered one over the other: \"The place,\" he says, \"was like a Russian doll.\"It was only at the start of this year that he finally decided to focus all his energies on turning the space into The Gate. \"People were steering me off, saying, what are you doing, opening a pub in the Gallowgate \" He knows that a more obvious choice would have been Finnieston, the West End or the Merchant City, \"but I just see the potential down here. I see the potential for the area. If there was an actual physical equation of what makes an area, then the closest Ive seen in the UK isnt Shoreditch or Hoxton. Its a place in Manchester called the Northern Quarter. Its got a live-music venue, a high concentration of licensed premises, and lots of character ndash much, in other words, like the Gallowgate.\"What I wanted to create was a modern pub,\" he adds. \"I grew up in Greenock, my family owned pubs, and what Ive always been obsessed with is the ideology of a pub.\" The decor includes original features, such as fireplaces and oak beams the interior is dark forest green with copper touches, a reclaimed wooden floor and textured tartan wallpaper the gantry is extensive. The toasties include chorizo and chilli jam.:Bioersity projects share fund to boost nature in urban areasGemmell insists that \"gentrication\" of the Gallowgate is absolutely the last thing on his mind. \"As soon as I got the keys for this place, the first thing I did was go across the road and introduce myself to every single person I saw, and told them what I was going to do. I know the old-school way in which things work.\"I couldnt be happier with the way things have gone so far. On the opening night recently I had Stevie, from [nearby] Bar  and his we having a cocktail, alongside many local people, all enjoying the atmosphere. Im not here to gentry anything: Im here to highlight what I think is a great area, and hopefully use my travels and my experience to make this place a success.\"\"Weve just got a feeling for the area,\" Tom Joyes says with emphasis in his wood-led office, deep within the Barrowland Ballroom. \"Not just myself, not just Andy, but everyone in the general area.\"Our company, Maggie McIver Ltd, founded the Barras way back in  and opened the ballroom in . In two years time the market will be a hundred years old.\"Now, in all the  years Ive been here, weve always been in a void so far as the ious authorities ndash Glasgow City Council, the GDA [Glasgow Development Agency], the SDA [Scottish Development Agency], you name it.\"Weve never been city centre, weve never been really east end ndash well, we are east end, but nowhere actually in it: its such a vast place. We were neither one thing nor the other. The void was the word that they all seemed to use.In the wider Gallowgate, Joyes observes that what has been evolving \"are entrepreneurs, artistic types, artisans\". Entertainment has improved, too: the ballroom is gaining in fame and worldwide prestige. And he argues that the area is right on the city centres doorstep, not out in a distant scheme.\"Were in this East End quarter,\" he continues. \"I think you should look at the map of Glasgow and should be seeing Finnieston, the West End, Collegelands, the city centre, Merchant City ndash and the East End Quarter. Its all the city centre, sprawling outwards. The sooner we get a recognised address of where we are, the better.\"He foresees a time when the Barras location can be given as the East End Quarter. \"A nice address it spruces it up a wee bit, to go with the nice streets and things like that.\" More: there could be a time when London Road, and businesses currently based at the Templeton building at Glasgow Green, can also say theyre based in the Quarter. \"Everything gains a wee bit value, a wee bit of prestige, a wee bit of credibility, as the whole area is improving.\"Up until a couple of years ago, Joyes confides, the area around the Barras wasnt a place he would have considered visiting for a meal on a Saturday night, but he and his partner have done just that, several times - BAad, Saint Lukes. He recently took some male members of his family on a pub-crawl. \"I told them we were going to the East End Quarter. They said, whats that  The places we visited were all very pleasant.\"Theres CCTV being installed: the place can only become safer. The streets and pavements have been upgraded. The whole area is evolving. Our message is that, of an evening in the entertainment sides, you can go to Merchant City, or the East End Quarter.\"The group behind the plan for an East End quarter brings together many of the influential people, including Joyes and Gemmell, who are reshaping the Gallowgate. Promotional material, shown to The Herald, speaks of an intention to ldquoshowcase the best of hospitality, music and the arts in The East End of Glasgow.It continues: \"Glasgowrsquos East End, [based] around the iconic Barrowland Ballroom, has seen a resurgence over recent years with some great food and drink operators and creatives hustling hard to drive tourism and bring a new focus to the area.\"It is our mission to create a  to showcase these erse venues, the people, music and attractions, to propel Glasgowrsquos East End Quarter into the spotlight as the lsquoplace to gorsquo.\"There will be heavy promotion of #EastEndQuarter across Instagram and Facebook, and, the material says, \"we will create beautul photography, immersive video and styled posts to champion East End Quarter businesses, attractions, art venues, people and more, with a strategic plan that engages stakeholders and visitors.\"Tourism will play a key part. \"There is so much potential for tourism and we will galvanise operators and businesses in the area to collaborate and thrive together.

Despite best efforts, this proved to be the only option for @scotgov to prevent job losses and ensure that ferries for the Clyde and Hebrides service can be completed. @DerekMackaySNP is visiting the yard now to speak with workers. https:t.co NjrvEGrjziThe yards owners accused the government of ousting them in a \"behind the scenes\" deal.The Scottish Tories called for a full parliamentary inquiry into the \"national embarrassment\".Administrators Deloitte have beenappointed to take over the yard initially before it is leasedto the government in the absence of anycommercial interest.There willa clear-out of the existing management.A new \"turn-around director\" has been appointed to stabilise the business and help recruitment a newmanagement team, including a Chief Executive Officer.Former BAE Systems boss Vic Emery has been tipped for the CEO job.The Government said it would operate the yard under a \"management agreement\" with the administrators while it was put for sale for around a month.If, as expected, no buyer is found, the government will acquire Ferguson Marine itself.It said it would developa ldquorevised cost analysis to helpcomplete the two ferries, then ldquoconduct further work to identy a viable future structure for the yard.Around  staff and  agency jobs had been at risk after Jim McColls Clyde Blowers Capitaltook the first steps towards administration last Friday.The firm bought Fergusons out of administration five years ago then landed a poundm contract to build two dual-fuel ferries for CalMac.However the deal rapidly soured, with runaway costs, design changes and a two-year delay.The government has already loaned Fergusons poundm to stay afloat.:Scots face paying out millions to nationalise shipyardCBC made it plain it had not agreed to the administration or public ownership move.In a statement, it said: \"We are aware that an administrator has been appointed today.\"The Scottish Government have not involved CBC or the directors of Ferguson Marine in any of the discussions leading up to this appointment.\"We are unaware of the deal that the Scottish Government have made behind the scenes and, as a result, are unable to provide any further comment at this stage.\"The First Minister said it was the \"only option\" to save jobs and the ferry contract.Mr Mackay said the new arrangement with the administrators would enable the ferries to be completed and secure a future for the yard through continuity of employment.It follows two years of faileddiscussions to find a commercial solution.Hesaid: ldquoWe have always been clear that we want to complete the vessels, secure jobs and give the yard a future. I am here today to ensure that we hit the ground running in making that happen and to reassure Fergusonrsquos excellent staff of the governmentrsquos commitment.ldquoPublic control will provide much-needed continuity of employment now and ensure the completion of the ferry contracts at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer.\"It is absolutely essential that the outstanding contracts to build these two ferries are completed in order to sustain the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services network and provide vital support for the economies of our island communities.ldquoThe alternative was for the government to stand aside while the company went into administration, resulting in the jobs being lost and the vessels not being completed. That was not an outcome I was willing to consider.ldquoWe are now working to put in place a management team which will refocus all efforts on completing this vital government contract. We will also be working closely with staff and the trades unions ndash as well as suppliers and customers - to achieve the best possible outcome for the yard.The government now faces a possible Scottish Parliament inquiry into how the ferry contract went awry and questions over how much taxpayers could end up paying.It also emerged today that a poundm Scottish Government loan to Fe engineering firm BiFab whicht was converted into shares was now worth just poundm.Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said:\"Some serious mistakes have been made which have resulted in delayed ferries for west coast communities and the jobs of hundreds of workers put at risk.\"Today is not the day to apportion blame and urgent lessons must be learnt. \"Now that Ferguson Shipyard is heading into government hands it is imperative that they set out a clear plan which should include a change of the leadership team at the yard.\"The GMB Union cautiously welcomed the governments intervention.GMB Scotland Organiser and CSEU Scotland Chair, Gary Cook, said: ldquoNationalisation secures the immediate future of the yard and that is a very welcome development, particularly after all the recent uncertainty.\"Our members were caught in the middle of a situation that had nothing to do with them and their relief will be palpable. It is five years since the yard went bust and the Scottish Government has prevented that from happening again.ldquoWe must be clear that nationalisation will not be a quick-fix and there will be challenges. There will for example be limits to the amount of private sector work for which the yard can compete but the alternative to nationalisation was closure and that was no choice at all.ldquoOur immediate priority is to secure the re-employment of the workers released last weekend because their skills are essential and then we will insist the government works with us to develop a proper industrial plan for the yard because lessons must be learned.ldquoWe can now look to the future and everyone should do so with a sense of purpose. With vision and competency we can get on with building the ships Scotland needs and together we can grow jobs and prosperity on the lower Clyde.:Letters: Ferguson Marine drama is yet another example of Scotlandrsquos total lack of industrial strategyTory MSP Jamie Greene said: \"The SNP Governmentrsquos decision to barge in and use ministerial powers to take over the yard simply covers up the true extent of how much they have messed up this bungled ferry contract.ldquoWe all want to save the yard, save jobs and see these new ferries completed.ldquoBut Derek Mackay has not explored all of the options available, and he has refused to compromise with the shipbuilders over the disputed costs.ldquoItrsquos clear that SNP have no clue how much it will now cost the taxpayer to run the yard, whether they can complete the ferries, and no idea what effect state ownership will have on the yardrsquos ability to secure other contracts.ldquoThis whole fiasco is a national embarrassment and a full parliamentary enquiry is the only we will get to the bottom of this mess.Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP opposition on Inverclyde Council, who had opposed nationalisation, said: \"This is an immediate relief for the community and the workers at the yard. A priority must be to now re-engage the agency staff who have been out of work due to the uncertainty.\"This however is a bitter sweet announcement. The level of investment by Clyde Blowers Capital helped completely transform the yard, putting it in good stead to grow by another  workers over the next  months. These are vital growth plans that I hope the Scottish Government can follow through on.\"I would call on the Scottish Government to publish a  year plan for the renewal of the  vessels in public ownership, work that must be the foundations of the long term security and growth of Fergusonrsquos.\"Inverclyde has been crying out for inward investment therefore its bitterly disappointing that we have lost the business leadership skills and economic input of Clyde Blowers and Jim McColl.\"Unite Scottish SecretaryPat Raffertyadded:ldquoUnite fully supports the actions of the Scottish Government to intervene and nationalise Ferguson Marine shipyards.\"Itrsquos clear at this stage that nationalisation was the only serious option on the table to save the yard and more than  highly skilled jobs.\"The Scottish Government have rightly acknowledged their obligations to the workforce, and the people the ferries would serve which must be acknowledged.ldquoUnite also welcomes the fact that the trade unions have been fully engaged in this process so far. This must remain the case going forward to ensure that the ferries on the existing contract become operable and future contracts can be secured. The yard can have a very successful future and we must all now play our part to make sure this happens.Ferguson Marine had been at the centre of an increasingly bitter row between ministers and Mr McColl, who sits on Nicola Sturgeonrsquos Council of Economic Advisers.He had blamed CalMacrsquos state-owned parent company Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd , which is behind the CalMac order, for design changes and rising costs.However CMAL insist Ferguson Marine took on the work knowing it was challenging.Mr McColl suggested the government absorb the cost of half the poundm overrun infor an equity stake, but Mr Mackay refused on the grounds it could breach EU state aid rules.Mr Mackay said on Monday that the government would not ldquohand over a cheque to complete the ferries because it would be \"illegal\" .Mr McCollrsquos frustration boiled over at the weekend when he accused ministers of ldquoabusing their power and failing to understand basic economics.:SNP ministers abusing their power over ferry contract, says Sturgeon adviserHe said: ldquoWe get soundbites from ministers, tweeting about finishing the ferries and saving the jobs in the yard.

They are always thinking about the next election. Eventheyrsquore barely out of one campaign, theyrsquore already planning and calculating for the next.Therersquos no need to be cynical about this. Itrsquos fundamental to the job.I think this universal trait helps explain Jo Swinsonrsquos freak-out over the idea of a caretaker government led by Jeremy Corbyn to stop a no-deal Brexit.The LibDems are going through a purple patch at the moment, their hardline on Remain lting them to second in Mayrsquos European election with a . per cent vote share and  MEPs.:Tory grandee Ken Clarke willing to lead unity governmentCompare that to the EU election of , when they were in a tuition fee hiking Coalition with the Tories, and came fth as their vote halved to .% and they crashed from  MEPs to one.Ms Swinson has taken over the reins just as her party seems poised to recover its former clout and become a kingmaker again after the next election.But that path runs through Tory turf in the south and south-west of England where Mr Corbyn is toxic and an alliance with him could scupper her dream.At the  election, the LibDems came second in  seats across the UK. They came behind the SNP and Plaid Cymru in single seats and behind Labour in seven. But they are the second place challengers to the Tories in .They recently picked up one of those in last monthrsquos Brecon  Radnorshire byelection, but you get the picture.If the LibDems are to build on the momentum of the EU election, in which proportional representation greatly helped them, they must defeat sitting Tory MPs under the much tougher first-past-the-post system.If they help install Mr Corbyn in Downing Street, even for a few days to extend the Brexit deadline and call an election, those incumbent Tories will use that against them at every turn.You can see the posters now. A giant Nicola Sturgeon with a smaller Mr Corbyn in her pocket and Ms Swinson tucked into his, like a set of Russian dolls.The other opposition parties will be making similar calculations about the next election too, of course. But they face less pain than the LibDems.:Humza Yousaf says he struggles with the name of the SNP and its connotationsThe SNP are consistently high in the polls and see little threat from Mr Corbynrsquos plan. Better, they may even get a snf of Indyref. And itrsquos not astheir Tory opponents in the north-east could get even angrier at the Nationalists.Labour meanwhile would love to be able to go into an election with ldquoRe-elect Jeremy Corbyn as a slogan after their leader had had a dry run at the job.So when Mr Corbyn proposed talks on a time-limited government of national unitywith him at the helm, it was understandable that Ms Swinson instantly discounted it as ldquononsense.The Labour leader could never persuade a majority of MPs to support the idea, including many Labour MPs, far less would-be Tory rebels, so it wasnrsquot worth considering, she said.Nor does she trust Mr Corbyn. Besides his endless havering on Brexit, she has said she regards him as a danger to national security and the economy.She may be right about all of the above, but she was still wrong to dismiss it.The proposal is a useful thing per se. It gets the ball-rolling and the parties talking. What,anything, emerges from those talks may be a quite dferent plan. But the main thing for Remainers now is to put a sht in and arrive at a workable scheme. Mr Corbynrsquos invitation to parley has at least got that process underway.It also forces Remainers to face up to the fact that passing a no-confidence vote in Boris Johnsonrsquos government is not sufficient to stop no-deal. You canrsquot spend half a fiver. You need a credible plan to give value to the first part.Indeed, without knowing what comes next, Tory rebels are unlikely to vote no-confidence and end their political careers. If Remainers ever find it, the missing piece may turn out to be a GNU or emergency legislation or some other improbable novelty. No one knows. And so you have to keep all options open.Following that logic, Nicola Sturgeon was right to say she could work with Mr Corbyn to stop no-deal. She later said she wasnrsquot a fan, and would prefer not to start from here, but, hey, needs must.Even Sarah Wollaston, the former Tory MP turned LibDem, accepted the Labour leader may be ldquothe lesser of two evils when set against no-deal.There are a lot of mind games and brinkmanship around no-deal.With his lsquodo or diersquo promise about October , Mr Johnson is trying to create a sense of inevitability about Brexit and instil fatalism in his opponents. The mop-topped Moses hopes theyrsquoll part like the Red Sea and let him bumble into the promised land.Despite leakers reportedly being threatened with the sack, his government keeps leaking tit-bits to reinforce this.

If the party also let an avoidable no-deal Brexit take place when it might have acted, it would never recover."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10287161.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-highland-solution-southern-europes-depopulation","story":"The TV reporter has come to the sleepy community in Spainrsquos vast and central Castilla La Mancha province to talk depopulation.

A majority are pensioners. Only four of them are children.FULL STORY:Spain to copy the Highlands on stopping people exodusMs Acedo, from local public broadcaster CMM, is doing vox pops, vox populi, where there is barely a populus to have a voice.ldquoHalf the houses are shut up, said one middle-aged woman in the street. ldquoThere are entire barrios, neighbourhoods, that are nearly closed, added another.One interviewee, an elderly woman standing in Torrejoncillorsquos deserted main square, sums up why her community is dying. ldquoThere was no work, ldquo she tells Ms Acedo, ldquoand the people emigrated.It is more than a year since CMM TV covered the depopulation of Torrejoncillo. That came after figures showed the town had lost % of its population in  alone.But this one town is just part of a bigger picture. It is in Cuenca region, part of Castilla-La Mancha whose population has dropped a third since the beginning of the th century, a period that has included a civil war, depression and decades of authoritarian right rule.Cuenca region is, along with the Arctic north of the Nordic world, is suffering the steepest depopulation in the European Union.Local authorities and business and civic society lobbies in the region - whose stunning capital, also Cuenca, is famed for its homes hanging from its clfs - think they have a solution. They want to copy Scotland and its half-century long effort to keep people in the Highlands and Islands.Last week Pedro Saacutenchez, Spainrsquos acting prime minister, took an interest in the scheme at a depopulation summit.Cuenca, along with neighbouring Soria, also in Castilla La Mancha, and Teruel in Aragon, is part of an international network called Southern Sparsely Populated Areas or SSPA.They are joined by a Croatiarsquos biggest county by area, Lika-Senj and Evrytania, a mountainous region of central Greece. These areas are being hollowed out.Impoverished Lika-Senj, despite being home to some of Croatiarsquos top tourist sites, such as the deep blue Plitvice Lakes and waterfalls, is haemorrhaging people.Plitvice LakesIts population was estimated at , in mid-.

Young people leave.It is easy to see therefore why Scotlandrsquos efforts look like a success from afar.After all, there are around as many people in the Highlands and Islands as there were in the middle of the th century.A hundred thousand souls have been added to the region - which includes Moray, most of Argyll and Bute, as well as Arran and the Cumbraes on the Firth of Clyde - since Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson created the old Highlands and Islands Development Boardin .VIEWPOINT:Brian Wilson: the unfinished business of the Highlands and Islands Development BoardNobody in Scotland thinks the job is done - eventhe post Clearances population decline has been effectively reversed.HIDB has morphed in to Highlands and Islands Enterprise or HIE but it still has a fundamental remit: giving people a reason to live in the region.That is because, those close to development projects stress, there are still communities on the very edge of viability. Scotland has its Torrejoncillos, such as islands which are just one family leaving away from losing their schools.ldquoOrkney or Oban might be booming, said one source. ldquoBut there are still parts of the Western Isles or the Cowal peninsula that are losing people.More people are dying in Outer Hebrides than are being born.

They want to politics-proof re-population.SSPA, funded by the European Union and ious regional governments, produced a major report on the Highlands and Islands. One of its main conclusions was the importance of having ldquoa strategy and an agency of great autonomy to guarantee long-term continuous action.

I expect it will be booked solid next year after this prime time advertisement, but worth a try.

The Tay stared back. ldquoCome on salmon, cooed Paul.One fish for every , casts, said Calum, sending an Exocet missile straight into their ballooning hopes. But then Bob had a bite. Paul leapt into action, ditto Calum . It was not to be, and in the middle of the melee, Bob fell over. The mood turned sombre. Silence reigned. Then all three burst into laughter. You had to laugh.Come the end of the half hour mix of silliness and gentle rumination, Paul had made peace with their failed quest. ldquoThatrsquos salmon fishing, Bob.

Then we can all go out and bring this sorry debacle to an end.Andrew Chamberlain, Glasgow.NICOLA Sturgeon accuses the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, of being \"daft\" . Nothing could be further from the truth. Ms Swinson is being a genuine politician standing up for what her party believes in without resorting to fake attraction to others. She understands that this sudden \"love\", by the SNP, for Labour is only a ploy in regards to Labours new position, it seems, vis a vis another Scottish independence referendum.Ms Sturgeon used to be seen as an astute politician. No longer. Such brazen attempts to obtain indyref by any means possible simply exposes the lack of a true ability to persuade a sceptical population of the merits of independence. In doing so, she has completely wrecked the careful build up of this idea by her predecessor, Alex Salmond. To go from around  per cent acceptance of independence to  per cent was the easy bit. Gaining more is an uphill struggle. Fake friendship with Labour will not do it, nor will getting other party leaders on board who will only destroy their own credibility.Independence needs a firm foundation to be viable both in the short and long terms. Nothing the SNP has posited suggest this will be the case, hence the need to try to gain it by the back door.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.I THINK Ian Blackford is right. All parties should work together to stop Boris Johnsons No Deal. The \"advisory\" Brexit referendum was achieved through lies peddled by the Leave campaign.Dominic Cummings, the Leave mastermind is now at the heart of government directing the UK leaving the EU without a deal, accelerating the UKs descent into economic and political decline. We cannot allow this to happen.Stuart Baillie Strong, Edinburgh EH.I MUST admire Jo Swinsons barefaced political arrogance, trying to replace the leader of the official opposition with Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman, both wise enough to keep their own counsel, on the subject of an Emergency government.May I remind Ms Swinson that Jeremy Corbyn was elected by more than , Labour members and supporters. Although it looks unlikely that Mr Corbyn will ever become Prime Minister, democratically he still should be given the opportunity.Since recently becoming leader of the LibDems, Ms Swinson has stated that she is willing to form a coalition with the Tories, and that she would not work with the SNP, even though it is the third-largest party in Westminster.As Ms Swinson parades in the media circus, claiming to be a Liberal and Democrat, lets examine her previous voting record -: Voted for the bedroom tax, the trebling of tuition fees, supported housing benefit cuts, invalidity and benefit sanctions, cuts to youth employment funding, voted in favour of the mansion tax and finally. voted  times with the Tories.After seeing this the electorate of her constituency, East Dunbartonshire, must surely conclude Ms Jo Swinson is neither liberal nor democratic, and that she is not representing their opinions and views, but is instead self promoting her own political agenda and making herself more electable to Southern Britain.Robert McCaw, Renfrew.I WOULD remind Peter A Russellthat the political landscape in Scotland, the UK and the EU is unrecognisable from that of five years ago, when Scotland was assured that only by remaining within the UK could we secure our place in Europe. Now, with Scotland dragged to the edge of the hard Brexit clf, it is heartening that not one EU country has declared that they will oppose an independent Scotlands membership of the EU. Elma Brok, the former MEP, and considered to be one of the foremost authorities on the EU constitution has said \"it would be easy to have membership negotiations because Scotland fulfils all the needs for membership\", Spanish Minister Josep Borrell has said Scotland would be accepted into the EUit voted for independence, Manfred Weber, leader of the European People Partys Group, Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group and Gunther Kirchbaum, head of the Bundestag Committee for EU affairs have all made supportive comments regarding Scotland becoming a member of the EU. And Ursula von der Leyen, elected as President of the EU Commission has expressed herself as a fan of Nicola Sturgeon, and stated that she knew \"first hand how the debates in the UK are.

If you see a hedgehog lay still in the open, or with flies round it orit’s struggling to walk properly, it is in urgent need of rescue.”If you find a hedgehog in need of help the society suggest you use gardening gloves or an old towel to collect the animal, placing it inside a high sided cardboard or plastic box with the towel or an old t-shirt in the bottom for it to hide under. Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances that led up to the incident\"  Appeal for information following suspicious fire in Peterhead viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

Now we want to reach out to the public and local organisations theand breadth of Scotland to get their feedback.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to consider the new strategy and to join the conversation. “The consultation is available online but we will also be going out to communities across rural, island and urban locations in the next  weeks where it would be great to hear as many views as possible.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin points out a wall during the Bennachie dig.\"  Open day for people to see dig at Bennachie viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"The strategy aims to protect our climate as well as meeting the needs of its people and businesses.It’s a fine balancing act but the government believes the strategy will tackle climate change, help the economy prosper and improve our health and well-being. There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started. With their support together we can protect Orkney’s unique wildle for future generations.”The traps will be laid around  metres apart in preferred stoat habitat, which may include some road verges. They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay. Those involved said that they are grateful for any sightings of stoats which can be reported via the Stoats in Orkney Facebook page giving a map grid reference.Stoats pose a very serious threat to Orkney#s native wildle particularly the Orkney vole, hen harrier, short-eared owl and other ground nesting birds such as red-throated ers, Arctic terns and curlews for which Orkney is internationally important and upon which Orkney’s thriving wildle tourism industry relies.Keep up to date with the blog ‘Stoat Snippets’, the Orkney Native Wildle Project Facebook page at www.facebook OrkneyNativeWildleProject or visit www.ONWP.orgcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

To make sure you can have your say at future elections, simply check the form you receive and respond as soon as possible.“All responses can now be made online and we would encourage householders, where possible, to use this method rather than ing the form in the post.”People who have changed address recently are particularly encouraged to keep an eye out for the form and check the details.Research by the independent Electoral Commission indicates that recent home movers are far less likely to be registered than those who have lived at the same address for a long period of time.Across the UK,  per cent of people who have been at their property for more than sixteen years will be registered, compared to  per cent of people who have lived at an address for less than a year.Further information about registering to vote is available on the Electoral Commission website at https:www.yourvotematters Any residents who have any questions can contact the Electoral Registration Office at  Broad Street, Kirkwall.

No doubt our very own Prince Philip will have been pulling the strings, emboldened from ordering the security service to make the deaths of our very own Diana, the People’s Princess, and Dodi Fayed look like an ‘accident’ back in . Dedicated conspiracy theorists understand this, to suggest otherwise is akin to being seen out with your best mate who’s wearing an ‘I’m with this Idiot’ t-shirt. Duh.However, there comes a point in everyone’s le, say around the age of , where you have to put down the joint and the beef-flavoured Monster Munch and leave the conspiracy theories to the likes of Netflix.: : It’s great fun discussing who shot JFK with your mates , be it down the boozer or in the comfort of your own home, after the Wall’s Viennetta has been served with Simply Red playing gently in the background.But in my experience these types of encounters can often act as a social tell, like a poor poker player giving their hand away. If without really noticing it, the conversation veers from fake moon landings towards “the Rothschilds control everything” or “MI rigged the  Indy referendum” then chances are you’ve got a KP nutter on your hands and next time it might be besttheir homemade lasagne stays at home with them. Gently guide them on their way as you hand back the six cans of Kestrel Super Premium Lager they brought. Bless. Be seeing ya. This kind of nonsense can easily creep in to these types of chats and all too often goes largely unchecked.Without wanting to sound overly harsh, you’re definitely a bit of a saddoyou’re still hankering after conspiracy theories to explain why le hasn’t quite panned out the way you expected by the time you’ve hit your s. Stuck in a boring - office job, we, kids and the boss doing your nut in, drinking a wee bit too much and not clearing the overdraft Easy, that’s the fault of shadowy elites who have infiltrated HR, ensuring that only young people who understand the bloody computers and something called ‘digital’ get promoted. Yip, the deep state has genuinely conspired to stop you – Rab fi Leith – from getting oan in the world. Pass the herb.Most of the ‘really good’ conspiracy theories come from the US and are borne out of people’s fears and a desire to understand the basic question: how could that happen They often evolve from a perceived failing of the state to protect, be it the le of a president or a politician in the case of JFK or his brother Robert who were both gunned down in their prime. It feels like our personal security has been compromised in some way. The   terrorist attacks are a great example of how conspiracy theories evolve. In this case, they range from a controlled demolition contributing to the collapse of the Twin Towers caused by government insiders to the bringing down of the mysterious World Trade Center  building which housed the CIA and Secret Service – as part of a cover-up to hide state complicity in the attacks. And United Airlines Flight  was shot down by fighter jets before it could reach the White House.In this conspiracy-driven environment, hundredsnot thousands of eye-witness accounts are pushed aside in favour of a narrative chosen by those who spend too much time sitting in their Y-fronts browsing the internet.The desire to push the truth to one side in this instance seems overwhelming for some. Nineteen hijackers armed with nothing more than craft knives – or Stanley knives like the football casuals of the s – hijacked, then weaponised three out of four planes, murdering around , people in the richest, most powerful country in the world. The knock-on effect of this was two wars – one in Iraq, which had as much to do with the   attacks as Iceland – at a total cost that is still running into the trillions. It’s no surprise some folk embrace conspiracy theory alternatives when the truth, as was the case on  September, , is so shocking to accept.The list of conspiracy theories is endless, a shopping list of bampottery from the Flat Earth Society to anti-vaccination types, global warming deniers and everything in between. Believers clearly haven’t got over being lied to as kids and I do have a modicum of sympathy with this. From our first steps, we’re fed a constant stream of lies, designed to regulate our behaviour – Santa will take you off his list, look what the the tooth fairy has brought in the middle of the night, and the police will come and take you away to the school for bad boys.In this environement, it’s no wonder some ‘damaged people’ seek their own alternative truth.

Like most parts of the world, we have more reasons to be ashamed of ourselves than just one. How many of us can say we have never heard a racist word spoken : Edinburgh Festivals : Bringing Red Dust Road to the stageFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereSo when Jackie Kay, Scotland’s Makar, says Scotland is decades behind cities in England when it comes to tackling racism and facing up to this country’s participation in the slave trade, we should listen.Kay, born to a Nigerian father and a Scottish mother in Edinburgh, said in Scotland “it seems to be acceptable to keep on asking people where they are from in the way that you just don’t do with a black Liverpudlian, a black Brummie or a black Londoner. You can’t accept that now, in ... It’s not just about people being there and a erse population, it’s about how we actually change our image of ourselves when we think of what it means to be Scottish.”In a world where the far-right is on the march – quite literally in places like Charlottesville, Virginia – and ‘identitarianism’, which is just racism and fascism in an ‘alt-right’ disguise, Scotland has bucked the trend. Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP and every other mainstream political party have stood foursquare in opposition to the kind of hate-filled populist nationalism that has attracted considerable support in places like Hungary.But that doesn’t mean we can be in any way complacent. It’s not accurate to call Scotland a “racist country”, but it’s equally untrue to say that we do not have a problem with racism, equally wrong to think we can simply ignore the evils of the slave trade – which still echo in our society today – in discussions about our history.Kay’s point is quite a subtle, philosophical one. As we go about our everyday lives, it’s not all that often that we contemplate “our image of ourselves”. But it is important to do so, because it is something that informs our day-to-day interactions with other people.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why the greens are wrong over catholic education representatives john mclellan","story":"As long as we have Catholic schools, it#s not unreasonable to have church representatives on council education committees, writes John McLellan.It is a sign of the febrile political times in which we live that, in pondering over this week’s column, I quickly concluded that even for someone brought up in a Rangers-supporting, Protestant Glasgow household it would be easier to write about Catholic schools than Brexit.In the two years since I was elected as a Conservative councillor , there is no question the letter-writing campaign orchestrated by the Catholic Church to fight a Green Party move to strip church representatives on Edinburgh’s education committee of voting rights is the strongest cross-city protest we have received.Yes, we get bombarded with cut-and-paste anti-Zionist complaints about the Lothian Pension Fund’s investment in the Israeli Bank Hapoalim, but this is dferent after Archbishop Leo Cushley’s condemnation was read from pulpits a few weeks back, scores of hand-written letters and Catholic Church postcards arrive every day to demand that voting rights are preserved.The place of three religious representatives on Scottish education committees is a statutory guarantee, going back to the  Education Act when ‘voluntary’ Catholic schools were brought into a new state system along with board schools and given the same funding under new county education authorities.: Archbishop brands removal of church education committee voting rights as ‘a serious threat’ to future of faith schoolsFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereNext week Edinburgh Council will vote on a Green Party proposal to remove voting rights following a similar move in Perth  Kinross after religious representatives sealed the fate of Blairingone Primary, a school near Dollar with just six pupils which the council administration was recommending for closure because it only had the prospect of five more.In Edinburgh, the same situation is unlikely to arise because of a convention that the religious representatives only vote on matters directly related to faith-based education, and as yet no-one has been able to point to an issue in which the religious representatives have caused controversy or swung a decision against a political majority. In Edinburgh, this is an issue looking for a problem. This week, an editorial in the Scottish Catholic Observer didn’t pull its punches, saying that while the Green Party had some good ideas “a strain of absolute lunacy also runs through it... The party is arrogant and blindly devoted to its cause. ‘Religion is bad, therefore state-funded religious schools are bad’ is their thinking.”The Church regards undermining the place of religious representatives as the start of a process which will lead to the dismantling of Catholic schools and so presents a threat to the entire system, pointing to the history of discrimination as evidence of their continued relevance.While claims that Catholics face an ever-present threat of sectarian exclusion might still have some substance in small pockets in the West, in the East of Scotland it is weak to say the least. But not so the threat to Catholic identity of which, in an increasingly secular age, the schools are an essential part, and as Catholicism is an essential part of Scotland’s heritage this is something which should be valued and understood.But the schools also represent state-supported choice in education, which councils did so much to destroy in the s with the dismantling of historic institutions like the Royal High, the High School of Glasgowand Allan Glen’s. Like those schools, the choice they represent is one of improving standards. There might be a pointCatholic schools and their representatives were a drag on attainment and a threat to their children’s learning, but the opposite is the case with Catholic schools consistently out-performing their non-denominational neighbours.Judging by the attack on private school funding and the withdrawal from all but one international education measurement system, comparison and competition spell danger for the Scottish Government and eroding the position of Catholic schools would be one more step down that road.The Edinburgh Green Party’s position has grown from their enthusiasm for giving children the day off to go on climate strikes to a desire to give pupil representatives a place on the education committee, but realising this is a non-starter it has decided thatthe kids can’t have a say then neither can the churches. This article started with a declaration of my background and some will no doubt argue that in itself is an illustration of a problem which separate schooling perpetuates. But ersity and choice is not the same as ision and as long as there are Catholic schools then giving the Church one voice on matters which directly affect the faith in those institutions does not seem to be controversial. The Green Party has chosen to make it so. As they say, hell mend them.Say no to Hangover DayOn choice, shops currently can choose whether to open on Ne’er Day, but a Holyrood motion from Labour MSP Jackie Baillie bids to force large shops to close to give staff a guaranteed break.

For once not the main event, Gordon Brown was on stage at the Edinburgh Book Festival this week to interview Serbian economist Branko Milanovic about his new book Capitalism Alone: The Future of the System That Rules the World. “It’s a privilege to be interviewed by a Prime Minister,” said Milanovic, to which Mr Brown quickly replied, “Former Prime Minister. I’m unemployed.” Aw.An expert on income inequality, Mr Milanovic’s book ides global capitalism into two categories: liberal capitalism, such as the UK and US, and political capitalism, like China and Russia, the former characterised by self-perpetuating affluent middle upper classes, the latter by corruption. He did not offer an alternative and many in the audience would have been disappointed about his view that global capitalism offered the best way to reduce global income inequality. Judging by the age profile, more than a few would baulk at his medicine for the evils of liberal capitalism – inheritance taxes.Mr Brown had a wrestle with Mr Milanovic, not over ideas but which member of the audience got to ask a question, but he takes back control is back at the Book Festival a week on Monday when he shares his observations about Scotland’s place in the UK and Europe and “the challenges around understanding of national identity”.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there. I have a fantastic photo of my grandmother working in the mill taken during the Coronation in . I am seeking anything relating to the mill and its history such as receipts, packaging or advertising or even furniture.”Neil commented: “I am part of a local history group, who meet regularly to discuss past events and places and we regularly showcase items so that they can be shared by all.“I would really love to put on an exhibition in Banbridge and that’s probably where this is going.”Open Day raises over £, Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Sadly Neil’s we Kate doesn’t share his enthusiasm for artefacts from the past: “She thinks it’s a load of junk, she’s a minimalist.”If you can help Neil add to his collection email him at neilreid@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed the 20 ni sights on lonely planet s ultimate uk travel guide","story":"The Giant#s Causeway has been ranked as the UK#s third best tourist destination by respected travel guide Lonely Planet, finishing ahead of attractions such as Hadrian#s Wall and London#s Tate Modern art gallery.For the first time Lonely Planet has picked its  most unmissable experiences and hidden gems across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands to form its ultimate UK travel hitlist.Titanic Belfast was also ranked in the top  UK destinations by Lonely PlanetIn total,  sights and experiences in Northern Ireland feature in the list which was unveiled today, including the Crown Liquor Saloon in Belfast, Rathlin Island and Londonderry’s walls.Out of the score of attractions only one is in Co Armagh , while none of the sights in Co Tyrone feature in the Lonely Planet must see list.Welcoming the news, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “The inclusion of  Northern Ireland experiences and attractions – including the Giant’s Causeway at number three – in Lonely Planet’s ‘Ultimate UK Travelist’ is good news and will surely help to inspire GB travellers to put Northern Ireland on their holiday wish-list. “It is another well-deserved accolade for all of these attractions, which provides Tourism Ireland with a great hook to continue to promote Northern Ireland as a ‘must visit’ destination.”Lonely Planet’s VP of Experience, Tom Hall, said: “Lonely Planet’s Ultimate United Kingdom Travelist brings together the UK’s most compelling sights and experiences, ranging from world-class museums and giant cathedrals to rollicking festivals, inky lochs and tiny pubs. “We’re thrilled to name the Giant’s Causeway one of the UK’s very best sights - alongside many other wonderful experiences in Northern Ireland including spotting puffins and seals on Rathlin Island and riding a boat through Co Fermanagh’s Marble Arch Caves.”Giant’s Causeway is described by Lonely Planet as “timeless” and “unrepeatable” and is beaten only by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and London’s British Museum.The Ultimate UK Travelist is available at a cost of £..

While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

Fans will be treated to singles Feel the Raindrops, Your Greatest Shade of Blue and s classic Broken Land – the ‘most played song on Radio ’ during that particular year. With just over two weeks to go until they tak the stage, songwriter Pat Gribben told the Andersonstown News that he along with the rest of the band are “looking forward” to the August  gig. “Of course it’s always nice to be asked,” said Pat, “I’m looking forward to catching up with Brian Kennedy. I played guitar with Brian and haven’t seen him since his illness and now that he is cancer free, it will be good to see him.”On composing one of the most iconic songs of the s, Broken Land, Pat explained how he had been “messing about” on producer Garry Bell’s keyboards. “I got my daughter to school that Monday morning and the main part of the song was done that day,” he said.Still heavily rotated on airwaves  plus years later, Pat said there are lots of songs written that could appear on a new Adventures album. “I think we are playing better now than back in the day, I don’t know why, maybe we are all more experienced. I’d like to put a new album out and give the people that come to see, that are coming to see us, that new work, new material to sing along to.”Pat spoke of how the band are already looking to  with a series of gigs already lined up. “I have a lot of material and it’s a matter of putting it all down and getting it out there. There is a great studio in Antrim, Einstein Studios, and that’s where we will go to do the work. “We have the Empire Music Hall booked for January and the Forever Young festival in Dublin. We are also performing at a benefit night in memory of Gerry Anderson at the Grand Opera House with all proceeds going towards cancer charities and the Greatest Hits gig at the end of August.”To vote for your ‘greatest hit’ visit www.belfastmediagroup belfasts-greatest-hits-nominations.

From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart. The Lansdowne is back with a bang – and so is quality food in North Belfast.The Lansdowne Hotel Antrim Rd, Belfast, BT EFTel:    www.thelansdownehotel"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland couple create stunning sea of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. Entry is £ or £ for  to -year-olds. Under s go free.

We have made  free takeaway meals - you dont need to buy...Posted by The Crown Inn Keynsham on Monday, August , David Yeomans, who co-owns the pub with his partner Luke Skinner, told the PA news agency: “We’re not bothered about taking any money over the bar, it is purely for the families and the children.“We’ve had people down here, the parents have had a glass of water, the kids have had a squash and a meal, and then they’ve gone home. It’s not a money maker.”Mr Yeomans was inspired after seeing a Facebook post from a local food bank appealing for donations because of the increased demand over the summer holidays.After donating himself, Mr Yeomans felt he could go one step further.He is now giving away dozens of meals at his pub every day – he estimates he has got through around  homemade meals in a week – and on Friday he hosted a free party for local children with a buffet, for which people were queuing at the door when they opened at midday.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  He said: “The buffet went out at  – it was full of food – and at  o’clock it was empty.

We’ve had working people come in with their kids that have got the meals and they’re in tears because they’re struggling to make ends meet, you’ve got people on benefits that are struggling to make ends meet.

We give the kids glasses of squash, say ‘go sit in the garden and do whatever you want, we’ll bring the food out when it’s ready’. “So they’re treated like any other customer.”Kids can get free sandwiches for lunch and meals like sausage and mash, macaroni cheese or tomato pasta to take away with them for dinner.The meals are currently being funded by the Crown, but Mr Yeomans hopes donations will start to come in to help support the venture.“If we can get donations that’s great so we don’t have to fund it all ourselves, because it is going to be an expensive thing,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh fringe display celebrates best of scottish twitter","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After he trained as an architect and engineer, he was apprenticed to the Derry building firm of George and Robert A. Ferguson. He later set up his own practice in the city and at a young age was responsible for large projects in Omagh, Coleraine and other towns.Amongst the projects he oversaw in his native city were the Corporation waterworks at Creggan and was he was also associated to the layout of Foyle College grounds for building purposes. But amongst Barkers main projects was designing a shirt factory for David Hogg and Charles Mitchell at Sackville Street in Derry. He had also been heavily involved in the project to build the new Presbyterian |Church at Burt, Co Donegal in the mid-s.Constructed in , Hogg  Mitchell’s shirt factory almost immediately won a highly lucrative contract when it became the supplier of shirts for the British Army during the Boer War . The company founded the ‘Old England’ line of shirts which later became the globally known ‘Peter England’ brand. It continued to manufacture shirts in Derry until the s and the façade of Barker’s building still exists today as the building was converted into an apartment block in .Tragedy struck William Barker when in late  he fell off a horse and never recovered consciousness before his death at the young age of  on May , .He left a widow, Maryand three children-Mary Violet Barker, Thomas McCurdy Baker and William Alexander his namesake at his home at Orchard Street in the centre of the city.While William Snr undoubtedly left his professional mark even at such a young age on his native city, it was his son Thomas who lived a truly fascinating le having borne bearing personal witness and suffered as a result of one of the most decisively brutal acts of the Second World War.Thomas McCurdy Barker was born in , was a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first full-time secretary of the Irish Christian Movement, the convenor and organiser of the  conference ‘Ireland’s Hope’, the proceedings of which he edited, and from the s a missionary and professor of New Testament Greek at Mukden in the Chinese province of Manchuria.The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the Republic of China and The Empire of Japan between July  and September . China fought Japan with the aid of the Soviet Union and the USA, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in  the conflict became immersed in WWII and a result became the largest conflict in Asia during the twentieth century.The war between China and Japan was the result of a decades long Japanese imperialist policy to expand its influence both politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw materials, food and labour.Internecine warfare in China also provided strong opportunities for Japan who viewed Manchuria as almost limitless supply of raw materials, a market fot its manufactured goods and a protective buffer against the Soviet Union in Siberia.Japan invaded Manchuria in September  after what bacame known as the Mukden Incident. It was an event staged by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for a full invasion.On September , Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto detonated a small quantity of dynamite close to a rail line owned by Japans South Manchuria Railyway near Mukden. The explosion was so weak that it failed to destroy the track, but it was enough to allow the Imperial Japanese Army to accuse Chinese dissident with causing it and as a result they invaded and occupied Manchuria, establishing a puppet state called Manchukuo after five months of incessant fighting. The Japanese even installed Chinas last Emperor, Puyi as the ruler to try and lend legitimacy to thwe situation.The invasion of the whole of China came six years later in July  when Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo Bridge-an access route to Bejing. As the conflict became merged into WWII, the Japanese began imprisoning people in concentration camps and amongst these was Rev Thomas McCurdy Barker who was incarcerated for the duration of the war at Nagasaki.On the day of the U.S nuclear strike on August ,  the population of Nagasaki was estimated to be ,. There were , Japanese residents, , Korean residents, , conscripted Korean workers, , Japanese soldiers,  conscripted Chinese workers and  Allied POWs.A Boeing B- Superfortress plane called Bockscar, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, took off just before dawn carrying a plutonium bomb code named Fat Man.The initial target was the city of Kokura, but it was obscured by cloud and smoke, so the Americans turned their attention to their secondary target-Nagasaki. But, it too was covered by cloud. Running short of fuel, the plane encircled the city several times and it was decided to use radar to drop the device. But, at the last moment the cloud cleared and the bomb was dropped on the citys Urakami Valley-midway between the Mitshubishi Steel and Arms plant in the south and the Mitsubhisi-Urakami Ordnace works in the north.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe plane had arrived over Nagasaki at .am and just under a minute after it was released it exploded at .am at an altitude of approximately , ft. Another sixty seconds after detonation the northern sec tion of the city was destroyed and , people were killed. Amongst the casualties were , of the , employees of of the Mitsubhisi arms plant and , more factory workers at ious other sites. These included , Koreans and  Japanese soldiers.Industrial damage at Nagasaki was high and left between -% of industrial production destroyed. The attack came three days after the first nuclear bomb had been dropped on Hiroshoma, but the Nagasaki device was more powerful than the first bomb but because the city was surrounded by hilly terrain there was less damage.In , another Irish prisoner who also witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. This was Dr Aidan MacCarthy, a medic in the RAF from County Cork who wrote: “Then there followed a blue flash, accompanied by a very bright magnesium-type flare which blinded them. Then came a frighteningly loud by rather flat explosion which was followed by a blast of hot air.“Some of this could be felt even by us as it came through the shelter openings, which were very rarely closed owing to poor ventilation.“We all genuinely thought, for some time, that this was the end of the world.”Amongst his fellow prisoners was a community of Catholic nuns to whom in the absence of a priest Rev McCurdy ministered to every day-an act which was later recognised when he received thanks from Pope Pius XII when he learned of the Derry mans actions after the war.Also there was Ann Barker, the Rev Thomas second we, who as a medical doctor also practised her profession during her imprisonment at Nagasaki. Her expertise is credited with helping her husband continue to live a rich le in his later retirement despite the effects that the bomb had on his physique.Lilian McCombe was a school teacher at the Presbyterian station at Mukden where she had lived and worked since .In  she wrote: “That chapter of my le closed with the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbour on December , . From that date, I with some  other colleagues were under Japanese jurisdiction. The greater part of the intervening years were spent in internment camps in the cities of Kobe and Nagasaki.“After a non-stop voyage of around three weeks via the Pacic Ocean, I was welcomed in the USA by my brother James, staying several days with the family there. The old Queen Elizabeth, then a troop ship brought me to Southampton, next day to be greeted by my family and later, by a host of friends!“Following a period of ing health, I was eventually led back into teaching until retirement age was reached.”The horrendous experience of imprisonment and a nuclear attack however did not appear to dissuade Rev Barker from giving up on his mission or other duties in Manchuria. Thomas, also it seems had the ear of the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong. And, despite the all encompasing rise of communism in China, he was allowed to continued teaching up until  when the leader of the Peoples Republic of China could no longer guarantee his safety-but Thomas Barker remained in contact with Mao Zedong up until shortly before his death.The cleric was -years-old when he ed to Ireland and was appointed as minister to the Presbyterian Church in Donegal town in  where he remained in service until .In recognition of his missionary service and his undoubted capabilities as a pastor the Church made him Moderator of the Presbyterian Church between - and his alma mater, Trinity College made awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. When he passed away in , aged  Rev Dr Thomas McCurdy Barker was buried at Castlerock in Co Derry.His father William, mother Mary who died in  and his brother, also a Presbyterian minister, Rev William Alexander Barker who passed away in  are buried in Derry City Cemetery.CAPTION: The mushroom cloud over the Japanese city of Nagasaki after the USA detonated an atomic bomb there on August , . "},{"url":null,"title":"derry search operation linked dissident republican activity","story":"The PSNI has said that search operation at a building site in Derry was part of an investigation into dissident republican activity.Detectives from the Terrorism Investigation Unit carried out the search at the former Nazareth House residential home in the Bishop Street area.Police cordoned off the district at the Sunbeam Terrace area in lower Bishop Street which includes a local primary school and Lumen Christi grammar school where students today collected examination results.

He brushed aside two weak challenges in the YC box before firing past Carberry.Within less than a minute it was -.A superb run and cross from Rice was laid off by Neale to the onrushing Thomas Healy and he steered the ball into the corner of Walshrsquos net for his first goal for Killyleagh.Killyleagh were struggling to deal with Olympicrsquos pace in attack, with Molloy in particular causing problems and it took a fine save from Carberry in the th minute to keep out the wingerrsquos curling shot.From the resultant corner Olympicrsquos two big central defenders combined, with Paul Dickson outjumping Macaulay Foster to head back for Jason Noade to head in and make it -.The second half was only four minutes old when Olympic had strong penalty appeals waved away by the referee when McClean went down in the box under a challenge from McConnell.Two goals inside two minutes shortly after the hour mark seemed to have killed the game.Nathan Jones was having his best ever game at The Showgrounds with Killyleagh struggling to cope with his pace when he switched to the left wing in the second half.When he was left one on one with YC sweeper Niall Walsh in the st minute he put on the after burners and delivered a beauty of a finish past Carberry.Ballynahinchrsquos fourth goal, two minutes later, was stunning. A superb team goal passing across the fullof the pitch, orchestrated by Stephen Noade and involving Jones, ended in a YC defender putting into his own net.Killyleagh, though, refused to throw the towel in and when their stand-out player, Rice, yet again exposed a vulnerability on the flanks, his inch-perfect cross was bravely turned in by Neale in the th minute.This was the spark for Killyleaghrsquos best spell of the game with Rice giving width and McConnell the creator and Jamie Sharvin linking up play.Walsh somehow kept out with his feet Jamie Sharvinrsquos nd minute effort from Healyrsquos pass and then three minutes later he gratefully ped on Jamie Sharvinrsquos close range shot under pressure from another Rice cross.The big crowd was getting value for the entrance fee now and Walsh underlined his Amateur League representative reputation by producing a supering save from Ricersquos cross to cut out the danger in the th minute.Olympic were content to hit on the break by this stage and substitute Aaron McClean went close with a header before the visitors delivered the ultimate sucker punch.A stunning pass from deep allowed Jones to race through and Dalton Tate delivered the finish in the nd minute.But still the game wasnrsquot finished. Rice powered down the line yet again and once more producing a teasing cross which Neale thumped in.It was now -.

By working with the Downpatrick Property Trust, we are able to regenerate this building to provide a commercial interest and much needed guest accommodation in the heart of the town.Breenrsquos Corner is the third project to be undertaken by the trust.It previously developed and later sold Maghinis House in Irish Street and also developed Britches Close in English Street as commercial and office accommodation.The trust also invested pound, in the Breenrsquos Corner buildings when they were bought and refurbished as residential accommodation in .The last of the residential tenants vacated the building several months ago and it has remained unoccupied.Current commercial clients which occupy ground-floor shops are not included in the development.The trust, which is chaired by Fergus Kelly, was described treasurer Mal McGrady as ldquoa community developer of the last resort which gets engaged when there is no private interest in developing a building or the cost of renovation would make development prohibitive for any private investor.He said: ldquoWe are excited by the new concept that Stephen Magorrian and Denvirrsquos proposed to us.ldquoThis concept is a win-win both for Denvirrsquos as it gives extra accommodation while bringing back this property into use which is beneficial to the townrsquos tourism offering.Mr McGrady said that the project was important to Downpatrick town centrersquos continued development.ldquoAt present this buildingrsquos external facade is an eyesore, particularly for traffic entering the town centre.ldquoWe will have the facility to provide an extra  beds in the town centre which will help provide accommodation for people on golf tours, bike tours, casual visitors and bus tours who stop at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and Down Museum and we believe that this will help regenerate the town centre, he added.The development, which is designed by JNP Architects and is being carried out by Keelryan Developments Ltd, of Newcastle, intends to provide affordable, contemporary guest accommodation to appeal to tourists and visitors who wish to stay in the town.Mr Magorrian said the Horatio Group would be responsible for the interior fit-out of the rooms and suites which would be leased from DPT and marketed by Denvirrsquos on its website and other hospitality sites such as Air bnb.ldquoI want the guests to be totally surprised when they come into the accommodation as it will be totally dferent to the exterior, he remarked.ldquoGuests can either walk the few metres around the corner to breakfast at the inn or enjoy a breakfast hamper provided by Denvirrsquos made up with items from local suppliers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17809395.festival-atmosphere-fun-day/resources/images/10266619.jpg","title":"bandstand john garrity","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band How would you describe your sound Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns hot-dogs Upcoming events in conjunction with Local Authorities are:Shambles Market, Armagh, on August Peoples Park, Ballymena, on August Carnfunnock Park, Larne, on August Celebrating business excellence at awards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"MIDU | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"MIDU | Article Teaser\"Bangor on August , and,St Columb’s Park, Derry, on August .If you would like to attend one of the ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events, get in touch with Dogs Trust’s Campaigns team in Northern Ireland via email campaigns.ni@dogstrust.org.uk or by calling .try catch  TrendingMankilled in two vehicle road traffic collision -

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute.

We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster business top  launch ","story":"Posted on Wednesday  August  by Ulster Business Sarah Little, publishing director, INM NI, Mark Thompson, AL Goodbody with John Mulgrew The cream of Northern Ireland’s business community have gathered to mark the official launch of the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies , with AL Goodbody.
