That they belong.\u0027\u0027It doesn\u0027t feel good to have been working at the company that put that out there,\u0027 Terra Field, a software engineer at Netflix, wrote in a Medium post.\u0027Especially when we\u0027ve spent years building out the company\u0027s policies and benefits so that it would be a great place for trans people to work.\u0027Three employees including Field were reportedly suspended last week after crashing a virtual meeting for executives on the Chappelle special, but later reinstated. Another was sacked for leaking internal data about the cost of the program.The walkout and rally have drawn support from film and television celebrities such as Jameela Jamil (The Good Place) and Jonathan Van Ness (Queer Eye), who have recorded a video message expressing \u0027love and support\u0027 for the movement.\u0027This has been such a challenging time I\u0027m sure for all of you,\u0027 Van Ness said in a video released Wednesday by the activist group Team Trans. \u0027It really is so often the trans, non-binary and intersex folks who actually advance theses conversations so often at risk to themselves and to their careers.\u0027Van Ness identifies as nonbinary.\u0027I know it\u0027s not easy. I know it\u0027s scary. I have so much respect for you and so much love and gratitude for you for sticking up for the LGBT+ community\u0027s right to dignity and safety and respect,\u0027 said Jamil. Acclaimed comedian Hannah Gadbsy - who has her own popular Netflix specials - last week called the streaming giant an \u0027amoral algorithm cult.\u0027Chappelle has been accused of mocking transgender people in the past, but remains hugely popular.In The Closer, he describes a US rapper who \u0027punched the LGBTQ community right in the AIDS,\u0027 compares trans women to the use of Blackface, and jokes about threatening to kill a woman and stash her body in his car.Chappelle - who is black - also argues that white gay people \u0027are minorities until they need to be white again,\u0027 and that LGBTQ communities have made progress in a few years that black people have not enjoyed in decades.Netflix trans employees and allies release a list of demands ahead of the walkout - The VergeNetflix Employees Stage Walkout to Protest Dave Chappelle Special - Variety"},{"url":null,"title":"The booster effect Cases dipping 60s experts say jabs drop","story":"Share this articleVaccine booster jab rollout in care homes falling short as deaths begin to riseHow Britain\u0027s vaccine programme went from world-beater to laggard in less than a year"},{"url":null,"title":"Britney Spears fianc Sam Asghari spotted house hunting Jeffree Stars mansion","story":"   Last year, at her father\u0027s request, the conservatorship (the one dealing with Britney\u0027s personal affairs, not the conservatorship controlling her finances) was temporarily transferred from Jamie to her long-time caregiver Jodi Montgomery.While he blamed his stepping down on health issues, Jamie\u0027s decision came amid accusations that he had gotten into an altercation with Britney\u0027s then 14 year-old son Sean Preston, now 16.Kevin Federline - Britney\u0027s ex and the father of Sean and his brother Jayden James, 15 - made a police report and took out a restraining order against his former father-in-law after the incident in which, reportedly, a \u0027very angry\u0027 Jamie broke down the door of a room Sean had locked himself in and \u0027shook\u0027 the frightened teen.Finally last month, a judge  suspended Jamie as the conservator of Britney\u0027s personal life and $60 million estate after 13 years, appointing accountant John Zabel as a temporary conservator. The suspension comes as allegations of his mistreatment of his daughter - including secretly recording her calls and messages - have ramped up the furor over his conservatorship."},{"url":null,"title":"Government paper says ramping price high carbon foods help people eat sustainably","story":"Share this articleWhitehall considers meat tax to slash carbon emissions"},{"url":null,"title":"British Gas gets rapped advertising watchdog rules energy giant misled customers","story":"Share this article The regulator said: ‘The ads implied that all British Gas HomeCare customers would be able to call out engineers to attend urgent issues at short notice.’Around 3.4million HomeCare customers pay the energy giant hundreds of pounds a year to insure and service their boilers.But lockdown restrictions and an engineer strike resulted in a major backlog earlier this year."},{"url":null,"title":"Saudi Arabia Japan Australia lobbied scientists water report climate change","story":"Share this article If China does not commit to new action, the prospect of keeping global warming to 1.5C could well be scuppered.

Coffey said that with total assets of £2tn the UK’s occupational pension schemes had huge power to channel capital into the infrastructure needed to move to net zero emissions. She went on: Although unionists have been keen to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Northern Ireland this year, it was created by the partition of Ireland and nationalists have less positive views of the anniversary. Kevin Meagher explains this well in his very good new history of Northern Ireland, What a Bloody Awful Country. Meagher, special adviser to Shaun Woodward when he was Northern Ireland secretary, describes Northern Ireland as “a masterclass in failed statecraft” whose creation led to a 50-30-20 century - 50 years of unionist dominance and Catholic oppression, 30 years of violence, and 20 years of stop-start progress. West also said he thought it was important for MPs to be seen wearing masks. Referring to the sight of MPs not wearing masks in the Commons, he said: While Conservative MPs have mostly refused to wear masks in the chamber in recent weeks, on the oppostion benches mask wearing is commonplace. At business questions this morning Pete Wishart, the SNP spokesman, said that behaviour of Tory MPs in this regard was “comic”. He said that four of the 14 Conservatives in the chamber at the time were wearing masks (earlier in the day the proportion was even higher), which he said was more than normal, but he challenged Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, to accept that Javid was right. Earlier, when Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, raised the same point, Rees-Mogg said that at the Labour party conference people were not wearing masks. He particularly cited the lack of mask wearing at the Daily Mirror conference party, and claimed this was evidence that “masks are worn more by socialists when there are television cameras around than when they are not going to be seen”. UPDATE: At the morning lobby briefing Downing Street sided with Jacob Rees-Mogg rather than Sajid Javid on this issue. Asked if the PM agreed with Javid about the need for MPs to wear masks in the Commons chamber, the PM’s spokesman said: Asked if Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, or Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, have called for the activation of plan B, the spokesman said: I was not listening to the briefing today - I’ve taken the quote from PA Media - but it seems the word “formally’ is quite important in that sentence. Government scientists have made no secret of their preference for a precautionary approach (see 9.44am), although Whitty and Vallance have also always been scrupulous in accepting that policy decisions are ultimately a matter for elected politicians, not expert officials. The spokesman also said the government listened carefully to organisations like the NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association which have both called for the implementation of a plan B. He said: Earlier campaigners handed in a petition at Downing Street highlighting the key demands from the Zero Hour campaign on the climate crisis. What may be most interesting is what the report says about policy options that might make a difference. Offering people a choice of vaccine would work best, it suggests. It says: In response Maggie Throup, the minister for vaccines, said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation were advising that six months should be the minimum gap between the second jab and the booster. As my colleague Jessica Elgot reports, Hoyle seems to have missed the point that Javid only made this comment in response to a question from the FT’s Sebastian Payne.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said that there are no plans to extend the vaccine booster programme to the under-40s “any time soon”, but that it will go ahead for vulnerable groups. There was not any evidence about waning immunity for young people and that included healthcare workers, he said. The issue would remain under review by the National Immunisation Advisory committee (Niac).Speaking on he told RTÉ radio’s Today show Dr Holohan denied that he was “anti” antigen tests. “It’s not the test I dislike, it’s how it’s applied.” “Our nearest neighbours, the UK, are probably the most prolific users of antigen tests, and have the greatest challenge in terms of infection that the Western world has seen”, he said.Dr Holohan said he was particularly concerned about cases where parents were using the tests when they had symptomatic children and when there was a negative result they then sent the children to school. Any one with symptoms should stay at home and get a PCR test, he urged.There had been a significant change in collective behaviour in recent times and there was now going to have to be a focus on reducing the levels of transmission of the virus in the community, he continued. The vaccine was continuing to protect people from serious illness and hospitalisation, but it was only one tool and other tools such as public health guidelines on mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing and ventilation were required, he said.Anything that could be done to improve compliance should happen, he said. It could take only a slight improvement or shift in collective adherence to ensure a shift in transmission levels. Dr Holohan said that while it was not mandatory, the guidance was that people presenting Covid certs should also present identification. If people were not asked for their cert they should not return to that premises. ‘Not a safe environment’“That’s not a safe environment. Irish people are not great at complaining. You should be asked for ID and a telephone number.”The reopening of venues this weekend would mean more social contact, so he called on people to be mindful of their personal behaviour and not to put other people at risk. If they had any symptoms then they should not be going out. Nobody wanted to go back to the “crude” measures of restrictions, he said.Even with the high levels of vaccination there were still risks with the high levels of transmission and there was a need to do everything possible to reduce those levels, added Dr Holohan.Three weeks ago, he said, he did not think that the situation would be as it now is. It was important that the reopening should be in accordance with guidelines to keep people safe. There will be pragmatic guidelines for nightclubs based on advice from other countries. The virus needed only the opportunity of people meeting closely to transmit and at present it was getting too many chances to transmit. Risky forms of behaviour needed to be limited.When asked if he would invite an unvaccinated person to his home for Christmas dinner, Dr Holohan said that unvaccinated people posed an increased risk of catching and transmitting the virus and the opportunity was still there to be vaccinated. “It’s important to protect yourself and those you love.”Dr Holohan also acknowledged that there was “a small number” of cases of the AY.4.2 Covid subvariant in the country. “We have the capacity to track those cases, it is not something about which we are raising alarm or concern at this point in time”.Ultimately, Dr Holohan said, he would like the country to be in a situation where the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) was not needed. “Alas the disease has taken a turn that we didn’t want it to take” he said and as CMO he needed the experts across a range of disciplines to help make a balanced and fair assessment of the situation for him to pass on to the Minister for Health.Booster vaccine campaignPharmacists, meanwhile, should be involved in the rollout of the booster vaccine campaign, the general-secretary of the Irish Pharmacy Union has said.Darragh O’Loughlin said pharmacists had been included in the original plans as vaccinators but were not included until the summer.“When we did start vaccinating we saw tremendous demand from people to get their vaccine in a local pharmacy - pharmacies were inundated with people looking to get vaccinated,” he told Newstalk’s Breakfast Briefing. Niac this week approved the extension of Covid-19 booster shots to people over the age of 60.A number of prominent GPs have criticised the HSE’s plan to rely on family doctors for administering boosters to older patients.However, plans announced on Wednesday did not contain any reference to pharmacies, Mr O’Loughlin said. A number of prominent GPs have criticised the HSE’s plan to rely on family doctors for administering boosters to older patients.Navan GP Ruairí Hanley said the system “cannot cope” with providing boosters to everyone aged over 60 in the coming months.“That will simply prove impossible in the context of flu season and the existing pressures on the system,” he told The  on Wednesday.Meanwhile Mr O’Loughlin said it would make perfect sense for pharmacies to be involved in the booster programme as there are 1,000 pharmacies in the country delivering the vaccine every week with people still coming forward every day to get vaccinated,.“It makes no sense that as we move into the booster phase of the programme we wouldn’t be involved in delivering those boosters”.“It looks like GPs are going to be expected to pick up the bulk of the work - despite the fact that the GP system is already under such pressure - and vaccination centres will be used as well.“We obviously aren’t saying vaccination centres shouldn’t be used, and we aren’t saying GPs shouldn’t be involved. We’re just saying that in a programme of this size and a campaign of this size, where we will want 800,000 people between the ages of 60 upwards to get vaccinated with a booster dose, it makes no sense to exclude 1,000 vaccination locations around the country”.Meanwhile, oncologist Prof Seamus O’Reilly, speaking on Morning Ireland, called for a targeted social media campaign to encourage the unvaccinated.Such a campaign had been undertaken by CervicalCheck and he felt it would help to address the concerns of the unvaccinated rather than berate them.The virus was going to be an issue for years to come as new variants emerged worldwide.This means vaccination programmes have to be accelerated, he said, otherwise waiting lists were going to grow as care was erted to Covid cases.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesThe Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh has said he is “sorry” church leaders “didn’t do more to become peacemakers, or at least speak peace into the situation.“Too often we allowed the attitudes of the societies around us which we serve us to shape us rather than the other way round,” Reverend John McDowell said.Archbishop McDowell was delivering a reflection at a church service in Armagh to mark 100 years since the partition of Ireland and the foundation of Northern Ireland.During the service Billy Smith, a student at Armagh High School, carried a lantern containing a living flame burning within to symbolise the Light of Hope through the cathedral and presented it to the church leaders.During a Centenary Prayer those present acknowledged “different and often polarised interpretations of history” and prayed that they might “learn from the experiences of the past ... so that the inheritance we pass on to the next generation is a gift of understanding, peace and hope.”In his own reflection, the Catholic Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin said that when looking back on the last 100 years he had to face “the difficult truth that perhaps we in the churches could have done more to deepen our understanding of each other and to bring healing and peace to our ided and wounded communities.”Looking back to 1921, Archbishop Martin said, he did so “like many others in my community and tradition ... with a deep sense of loss and also sadness, because for the past 100 years partition has polarised people on this island.”Citing the example of the Good Samaritan, “who crossed social and historic barriers to show love and mercy to the one who was on ‘the other side’, he said this was “why I stand here today, as a disciple of Jesus, with my brothers and sisters in faith, hopeful and committed to doing what we can to build a better future for all, a future in which mistrust and ision can become things of the past.”Point in historyIn the sermon delivered by the Reverend Dr Sahr Yambasu, the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, the congregation was told that “today we are marking a point in our history” and a time during which “many have made efforts towards building good community relations, but we have also witnessed too many terrible sectarian injustices an violence, too many win-lose political attitudes.“This service provides us with an opportunity, an opportunity to give thanks but also an opportunity to lament, to say sorry, to imagine what could be, and to choose the way forward, that can be mutually beneficial,” he said.The Right Rev Dr David Bruce, the President of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said he looked back on 100 years with “mixed feelings” and lamented the “physical and emotional pain which has been caused over the last century to so many people by violence and the language and words which leads to violence.“I grieve the times when fear has held us back from building relationships, relationships with those with whom we differ.If we are to build a better future then we must recognise our own woundedness and our responsibility to care for the wounds of one another ... relationships of all sorts whether personal, community, religious or political, must mature and strengthen both across this island and between these islands,” he said.The Service of Reflection and Hope, which was organised by the Church Leaders Group representing the five main Christian churches in Ireland, took place in St Patrick’s Church of Ireland cathedral in Armagh.The service attracted controversy following the decision of President Michael D Higgins, to decline an invitation to the service because he said the title of the event had become politicised and it would not be appropriate for him to attend as head of state.Queen Elizabeth, who had been due to attend, cancelled her visit after she advised not to travel to Northern Ireland on medical advice.She was represented at the service by Earl Caledon, the Lord Lieutenant of County Armagh.Guard of honourNumbers inside the cathedral were limited due to Covid-19 restrictions, with about 130 people attending, including the UK prime minister Boris Johnson Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and the chief whip, Jack Chambers Northern Ireland’s First Minister Paul Givan the leaders of the DUP, UUP, SDLP and Alliance parties and the Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis.Mr Johnson and the Irish and British Government representatives were welcomed to the cathedral by a guard of honour made up of local primary school children.A choir made up of children from different backgrounds and wearing brightly-coloured T-shirts to represent ersity and hope across the island sang a Song of Hope entitled We’re the Future of Tomorrow.The Irish language was also represented at the service, with an opening prayer in Irish read by Seán Coll and the Irish language development officer Linda Ervine.The organisers said other invited guests included civic dignitaries, children and young people, and over 100 community leaders working in peace-building, community development, health – including the North’s Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride – youth work, and various different aspects of church life.Welcoming the guests to the cathedral for the service, the Dean of Armagh, the Very Reverend Shane Forster, said those present “on this ancient hill of Armagh” had gathered “to reflect on the significance of this centenary year and the long road we have travelled which also stretches out before us.”We meet, he said, “people from erse backgrounds and traditions, with different beliefs and aspirations, to pray for the healing of past hurts and to seek God’s guidance and hope for the future.“Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has ided us, and yet it has also on occasion brought us together.“As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light-filled, prosperous and peaceful future.‘No celebration of partition’The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said the commemorative church service in Armagh on Thursday was “no celebration of partition” and those who had not attended should “look very carefully” at what had taken place.The leaders of four out of the five parties in the Northern Executive were present at St Patrick’s Church of Ireland cathedral for the service marking the centenary of partition and the formation of Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin did not attend the service, with the party’s vice president, the North’s Deputy First Minister, Michelle O’Neill, tweeting on Thursday: “make partition history”.Speaking to reporters after the event Mr Eastwood said the service had been a “reflection of the events that have happened over the past 100 years and it was, I think, a hopeful vision for the future, putting young people front and centre,” he said.Partition, he said, was “coming to an end”, and said that in order to create a shared island “we have to be prepared to share rooms with people who disagree with us.”Mr Eastwood defended the decision of President Michael D Higgins not to attend, saying he had a “different set of circumstances to weigh up.” “I don’t criticise anyone for not coming but I think they should look very carefully at what happened today, it was a reflection, it was a marking of an historical event. It was a hopeful service looking to the future,” Mr Eastwood said.However the DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson encouraged Mr Higgins to “actually sit down and watch this service, and perhaps see what it was truly about.“It’s not about politics, it’s not about one side gloating or in any way seeking to be overbearing on the other, but actually all of us coming together to reflect on the journey that we have been on, difficult, painful that it has been at times but also a journey in which I hope we have learned a lot of things.”He said the past 100 years contained many “painful memories” but the service had been a “great representation” of an inclusive, forward-looking Northern Ireland.“I hope we have learned lessons from today, that we will reflect upon in the future and when we’re given the opportunity to stand shoulder to shoulder to reflect, to speak of hope, that in the future we will do it together,” he said.Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said it had been a “wonderfully uplifting service” and “unfortunately not everybody could be there” that was the “task for the next number of years, to try and get people to feel comfortable all being together and understanding what our differences are from the past.“I think in the weeks and months to come people will look back and think what was the controversy all about... because what I saw was a real mix of people who classed themselves as Irish or British and many from other corners of the world,” he said.Alliance party leader Naomi Long described it as a “fantastic service of celebration in the terms of celebrating our differences.“I think it was a moment of reconciliation and an opportunity for us to come together and to look forward with hope to the future, to look at the kind of gracious acts that we need to do if we’re going to reconcile a broken and hurting community and a broken and hurting people on this island. “Peace building requires risks, reconciliation requires risks, the church leaders took risks, I commend them for that and I’m glad I was able to be part of it today,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics inside ten years as a government advisor with ed brophy","story":"Ed Brophy is a former chief of staff to finance minister Paschal Donohoe and to Labour’s Joan Burton when she was Tánaiste.

Two Eastern European cruise liners have also been brought to the Clyde as makeshift dormitories.It has prompted anger from the Government in Westminster, which believes Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u0027s First Minister, and Glasgow’s SNP-run council have risked the showpiece event turning into a national embarrassment.“It will be chaos if this continues,” said one senior UK government source.When Claire Perry, the former energy minister and then president of Cop26, announced two years ago that Glasgow would host the summit, she said it was the ideal venue because it is “one of the UK’s most sustainable cities with a great track record for hosting high-profile international events”.That reputation is now in shreds thanks to the nationalists running Holyrood and the city council.Earlier this year, the council ditched fortnightly bin collections in favour of one collection every three weeks - causing bins to overflow. At the same time, it introduced a £35 charge for disposing of large items, leading to an inevitable increase in fly-tipping. Thomas Kerr, the leader of the Conservative group on Glasgow council, said the city had become “the fly-tipping capital of Britain”.Critics were enraged when the council leader, the SNP’s Susan Aitken, brushed off the crisis by claiming the city merely needed a “spruce up”.Glasgow’s rat population has thrived on the uncollected food waste to become the fourth-biggest in the country. Three refuse collectors have even been injured by the rodents.Last week, refuse workers voted to go on strike during the conference, from Monday, November 1 to Monday, November 8, unless they are paid more money. The irony of a summit to clean up the planet being held in a city that cannot clean up its own streets will not be lost on those attending.Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said the SNP had ensured that “Scotland is set to be humiliated on the world stage”, while Paul Sweeney, the Labour MSP for Glasgow, said: “It\u0027s going to be an absolute embarrassment when we will shortly have world leaders stepping over bin bags and rats bigger than cats.”A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said of the planned strike by refuse workers: Cop26 will undoubtedly be a busy and difficult time for the city and its residents. Holding this action only in Glasgow at this time will have disproportionate and unfair local impact in pursuit of a national campaign. We urge them to think again about the timing of this.The spokesman said fly-tipped waste was being removed within two days of being reported, and that Glasgow\u0027s rat population was entirely in keeping with the size of the city.Hours after the GMB announced strike action by refuse workers, the RMT union announced a strike by ScotRail staff from November 1 to November 12 - the entire duration of the conference.Graham Simpson MSP, Scotland’s Conservative shadow transport minister, said the strike action was “a major embarrassment for the SNP” and would mean world leaders and delegates arriving in a city where rail services will have “ground to a halt”.The likes of Joe Biden, of course, are unlikely to hop on the train to get to Cop26, but many of the 25,000 delegates would have done. Now they will be forced onto the roads to get from their hotels to the Scottish Event Campus (SEC), where the conference is being held. Even before the rail strikes were announced, Glasgow City Council helpfully published a map of where to expect road congestion during the summit, which showed the entire city centre coloured in red.A gridlocked motorway and road network will be like nectar to members of Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and other climate change protesters.They will relish the chance to bring VIP traffic to a complete standstill by glueing themselves to roads, especially after Assistant Chief Constable Bernie Higgins, Police Scotland’s gold commander for the event, said officers on the ground “will facilitate unlawful protest, to a point” and would be “fair, friendly and accommodating”.His comments have caused such alarm that Police Scotland was forced to call a press briefing on Thursday at which they insisted protesters will not be allowed to disrupt the conference and that “protest removal teams” stand ready to remove anyone who blocks roads.If extremists needed any further encouragement, ministers in the Scottish Government have also issued an open invitation to them to disrupt the conference.Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens and an environment minister in Holyrood’s coalition government, has said he supports the use of direct action by climate change protesters and urged them to find “creative” ways to protest.For the lucky few, conference events will be a short walk away from their hotels in the city. However for others, a shortage of accommodation has forced them to book rooms up to 130 miles away.One Whitehall source said: “Embassies and businesses have been getting in touch with the Government because they are unable to get hotel rooms. It’s a massive problem.“Some of them have resorted to staying in England and commuting to Glasgow because there’s just nowhere to stay in Glasgow. We have heard of people deciding to stay as far away as Newcastle.”There are still rooms available through Airbnb, but the so-called “Glasgow gold rush” has seen property owners asking mind-boggling sums. One apartment in the upmarket Kelvingrove area of the city has been advertised at £103,000 for 12 nights, while dozens of others are asking more than £20,000 for the duration of the conference.A few hotel rooms remain available, but only to those prepared to pay 30 times the normal going rate. One room which normally costs £42 was being advertised for £1,400 per night during the summit, while other budget hotels are charging more than £1,000 per night.The lack of beds has become so dire that two cruise ships are being berthed on the Clyde for people working at Cop26. The Latvian-flagged Romantika has already arrived in Renfrew. It will soon be followed by the Silja Europa, from Estonia, in what the vessels’ owner, Tallink, described as a last-minute agreement.In an act of desperation, the Scottish Government has now appealed to residents to open up their homes and allow conference-goers to sleep in their spare rooms. They have suggested that the Cop26 Homestay scheme will enable delegates from poorer countries to “attend the summit and make their voices heard”. However, local health chiefs are concerned it will simply turn Cop26 into a petri dish for Covid.Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said: People coming from different parts of the world, some where the vaccination programme is not the same as ours, there are risks associated with that.Then you put people in touch with one another, in folk\u0027s homes, and that increases the risk even more.Downing Street fears that the multiple failings will not be enough to dampen Nicola Sturgeon’s desire to hijack the event for her own means. Leaked notes and WhatsApp messages have shown that Number 10 and the Cabinet Office are concerned she will use the event as a “soapbox for her independence obsession”. They want to make sure she does not share a platform with Boris Johnson at any point.A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We have been working very closely with the UK Government and partners, including Glasgow City Council and Police Scotland, to deliver a safe, secure and successful Cop26 in November. More from NewsPolitics latest news: Booster jab rollout must go \u0026#39as fast as possible\u0026#39 amid fears of winter Covid surge, Boris Johnson warns Boy, 14, charged with murder of five-year-old Logan MwangiAustralian police announce £540,000 reward for information about ‘abduction’ of four-year-old girlBBC comedy costume trailer plunges into Bristol harbour10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"deal new zealand win win countries","story":"This week is proving to be the biggest yet in realising our vision for Global Britain. On Tuesday, we hosted the Global Investment Summit, which saw the world’s leading investors commit nearly £10 billion to the industries of the future across the UK. Today, we are proud to announce we have secured a free trade agreement in principle with one of our oldest and closest allies: New Zealand.Our like-minded democracies could not be closer through our shared history and values. We are united in our fundamental belief that the best way to boost jobs and growth lies firmly in free trade, underpinned by high standards and the rule of law. This agreement shows what Britain can achieve through an independent trade policy, by slashing red tape for small businesses, securing zero-tariff access to New Zealand for all British goods and opening up their market to our world-class tech and services companies.This deal gives British businesses the competitive edge in New Zealand’s fast-growing market. It cuts tariffs on our goods exports such as ships, buses and bulldozers, which means firms can do business at lower cost in an import market which is set to grow by 30 per cent over this decade. In turn, we are making it easier for British consumers to enjoy more of the best New Zealand has to offer, from Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc to Manuka honey and kiwi fruit.This agreement is a win-win, and it plays to our strengths as the second-largest services exporter in the world. It will be easier for UK lawyers, architects and other professionals to work in New Zealand, allowing UK companies to set up there and take British talent with them.As we look forward to hosting New Zealand alongside other partners for the COP26 climate change summit, it is fitting that our new trade deal is one of our greenest ever. A far-reaching environment chapter will encourage trade and investment in low carbon goods, services and technology, with the most comprehensive list of environmental goods with liberalised tariffs in any trade deal.The agreement shows the UK’s readiness to lead the charge globally on clean innovation and sustainable growth and We already leading by example, with tariffs cut on over a hundred green goods from around the world as part of our Global Tariff regime. Investors can see we are a global hub for green trade, with EY estimating that London is the top city in Europe for investment-backed “cleantech” projects.it caps a fantastic week of good green news. Besides the success of Tuesday’s Global Investment Summit, £5.8 billion of foreign investment in green projects has been secured since the launch of the PM’s Ten Point Plan, along with at least 56,000 jobs in the UK’s clean industries.Digital trade is becoming ever more important, which is why we have agreed world-leading provisions that will cut red tape for our advanced tech and services companies and make it easier for smaller businesses to break into the New Zealand market.This deal also marks a major step in our accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This high-standards pact includes eleven dynamic economies, worth more than £8 trillion in global GDP as of last year.Joining CPTPP will mean we can export more than ever to a collective marketplace of over half a billion people who crave high-quality goods and services. That will drive forward an exports-led recovery across every region and nation of the UK, levelling up our country with high-quality jobs.Our deal with New Zealand will help us seize new opportunities abroad while boosting jobs, enterprise and prosperity at home.

Voters don’t like being treated like naughty children, let alone apathetic imbeciles, by technocrats convinced that they know best. Much of the electorate is now in a permanently defiant, irritable mood. It has grown allergic to stitch-ups by the ruling class across Westminster, the City, the arts and academia, and is repelled by attempts to impose a single political vision as a fait accompli, with no debate and no consultation. This applies as much to radical environmentalism and net zero, the groupthink du jour, as it does to Brexit, the NHS, overseas wars, crime or immigration.The universal franchise was hard-won. The electorate is deeply attached to its democratic rights, not just when it comes to form – elections being held, and results respected – but also in terms of ethos. It expects the great questions of the day to be carefully discussed, and for voters to have the ultimate choice between meaningfully different options. Decisions cannot be delegated to a self-anointed, conformist oligarchy.Voters hate it when, as with the EU, they were told by Labour, Tories and Lib Dems alike that ever-closer union was the best of all possible worlds, that the only acceptable debate was about the speed of integration, and that only a racist would disagree. Ordinary folks’ revenge, when it came, was devastating.It beggars belief, therefore, that a government of Brexiteers, in power only because they led a populist rebellion against another cross-party consensus, have forgotten this crucial lesson when it comes to net zero, and are seeking to enshrine a revolution without consulting the public. Yes, the vast majority, at least in wealthy nations, wants to improve the environment, reduce pollution, bolster bioersity, treat animals better and prevent man-made catastrophes.But that is where the near-universal consensus ends: the details of how to proceed are explosively contentious, and require democratic assent to be legitimate. The parallel with Brexit is clear: the fact that voters all agreed that another European war must be avoided didn’t mean they all wanted to fuse their countries into a superstate.The Government has learnt the wrong lessons from Covid – in a genuine health or military emergency, the electorate temporarily gives its support to any government it believes is doing its best. Even in such cases, a minority will favour alternative solutions, such as a Swedish approach.Decarbonisation is entirely different to the pandemic, whether or not you judge that we face a climate emergency. The public won’t automatically rally around whatever the government proposes. Many, perhaps most, will hate much of it. Net zero involves long-term, hugely significant measures that could drastically modify lifestyles and give the state immense, permanent powers to socially engineer as it sees fit.Do you agree that all new petrol and diesel cars should be banned in just nine years’ time? Or that gas boilers should be replaced, at great cost, with heat pumps, a technology that doesn’t quite work yet? Are you willing to eat less meat and pay higher taxes? Do you disagree entirely, or accept some of these ideas but not others? Or would you prefer to take it more slowly given China’s reluctance to act?The shocking reality is that how you answer is irrelevant. The public isn’t being given a choice. The fact of, and speed, scale and method of decarbonisation have been decided: Tories, Labour and Lib Dems all agree on all the essentials. It doesn’t matter who wins the next election: a new orthodoxy rules supreme. There is no functioning democracy, no mechanism by which outcomes might change. This is a disgrace and extremely dangerous.One doesn’t have to disagree with everything the Government is planning to be concerned. I really like electric cars, though I can’t see how banning combustion engines so quickly in the absence of better, long-range batteries can work. Why not let capitalism continue to organically shift consumers over? It is great that Boris rejects the hair-shirt, neo-communist approach to greening Britain, and that he backs nuclear and hydrogen. But do I really trust a government that has waged war on the car, invented so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods and campaigned against Heathrow expansion not to revert to banning everything vaguely carbon-positive if it falls behind on its targets?Why is its nudge unit advocating a tax on meat and producers and retailers of “high-carbon” food? The inflammatory document, disowned by the Government but commissioned by the Department for Business, demonises business travel and seeks to reduce international tourism and restrict airport expansion – goodbye, capitalist freedom. Can the Government guarantee that it would never impose extreme restrictions, rationing on homes and business or even mini eco-lockdowns? Or use a punitive form of road pricing to drastically reduce mobility (as opposed to ensuring motorists pay appropriately for road usage)? Will the courts start striking down high-carbon housebuilding or farming?Net zero isn’t a technical issue: it is an inherently political question, one of the greatest choices we have ever been asked to make. In the sickening absence of disagreement between the parties, a massive, uncontrollable backlash is guaranteed, at least when the bills start to drop. The only question is who the new green-sceptic Nigel Farage will be, and the next Boris figure? What will Vote Leave II look like?Johnson should preempt this war, which could destroy the Tories, and call a referendum on net zero today. His obligation, in doing so, would be to explain in exhaustive, costed detail how he proposes to achieve the changes he so fervently believes in. The No side would present its case, holding Johnson to account, proposing alternatives, with the public taken through the pros and cons and trade-offs. The results should be legally binding, with MPs compelled to implement the verdict, and the question tightly defined. The Government will have its work cut out: the Swiss have just rejected plans to slash their own emissions and to slap higher taxes on fossil fuels.The green challenge is too important, its implications too dramatic, to be left to an establishment that has embraced net zero as if it were a new religion. The public must have the final say, and the only way this will happen is through another referendum.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Booster jab rollout must go \u0026#39as fast as possible\u0026#39 amid fears of winter Covid surge, Boris Johnson warns Australian police announce £540,000 reward for information about ‘abduction’ of four-year-old girlBBC comedy costume trailer plunges into Bristol harbour10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotHalloween 2021: trick-or-treating, fancy dress costumes and why we carve pumpkins on October 31More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ahead cop26 dont blame countries defending national industries","story":"Today’s breaking news is that governments are as self-interested as the citizens they represent. This is not particularly earth-shattering stuff it could justifiably be filed under “And?”In this case, however, it could have significant and grave consequences for the future of our planet. Greenpeace has provided a dossier to the BBC that they say illustrates starkly the manoeuvring of various governments in the run-up to the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow next month. It details the changes those governments would like to see in the initial draft document being produced by the team of scientists compiling a key UN report that will form the basis of the next report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body tasked with evaluating the science of climate change.So what it says and what it recommends will be important, not just for the negotiations among the 120 leaders planning to be in the UK in November, but for the chances of a long-term agreement to cap global temperature rises to a sustainable level.No doubt the hope of Greenpeace is that the general public of those 120 countries will be incensed by the cynical self-interest seemingly displayed by key players. An adviser to the Saudi Arabian oil ministry, for example, is reported to have said that use of phrases like ‘the need for urgent and accelerated mitigation actions at all scales…’ be eliminated from the report. Lest we assume that only unelected governments appear to be behaving badly, the leak reveals that Australia has suggested that IPCC scientists delete a reference to analysis of the role played by fossil fuel lobbyists in watering down action on climate in Australia and the US. Meanwhile, Brazil and Argentina, two of the world’s biggest producers of beef products, argue strongly against evidence in the draft report that reducing meat consumption is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions.These revelations will inspire cynicism and pessimism in equal measures among those who hope that Cop26 really will provide the catalyst for real change in government policy across the globe. But maybe an extra dose of cynicism and pessimism is appropriate at this juncture.Essentially, these governments are being depicted as opportunistic, uncaring regimes who are willing to sacrifice the wellbeing of smaller, poorer nations for their own short term benefit. But either Cop26 will be a genuine negotiation or it will not. International negotiations do not traditionally consist of a group of prime ministers and presidents gathering in a room for five minutes in order to have a quick show of hands on something they all agree on before heading off to a state dinner.Climate change negotiations have always been difficult. That is proved by the scale of surprise we feel whenever serious and large changes are actually agreed. And they should be difficult: the Greta Thunberg approach to “negotiation”, of which our own homegrown climate activists approve, is simply to ask the most pessimistic scientists what they want and then to give it to them, irrespective of the social and economic consequences for the populations of the world.Such playground diplomacy focuses only on the consequences of climate change and never on the real lives of people who may find themselves out of work or being unable to afford basic heating bills. Banning all petrol vehicles and forcing everyone to become vegetarian tomorrow would undoubtedly solve the climate crisis, but it would create an arguably larger crisis in the developed world and among their citizens.Hence negotiations. And being negotiations, the conclusions they draw will not please everyone – neither should they. Compromises will be made because that’s what negotiations are for. Countries like Australia, India, the United States, Brazil and Saudi Arabia – and yes, the UK (although we might be sure that if our own government had been caught lobbying for its own political interest, that would have led today’s headlines) may be accused of letting down poorer states and of protecting their own corporate interests, but they’re also protecting domestic jobs and domestic standards of living. And only the most blinkered climate activists sneer at such priorities.If you have spent the last month sitting glued to the tarmac of the M25 or if you see the point of Cop26 only as an opportunity to protest against capitalism, then there are few realistic outcomes that will please you. Similarly, if you have chosen to ignore the science of climate change and believe that no ameliorating steps need to be taken to reduce carbon emissions by industry or iniduals, you will seethe with anger at the outcome.But let us not condemn governments for seeking to protect their own industries and citizens from the impact of the economic change necessary to limit climate temperature rises. At least they are engaged in the process, at least they’re actually willing to be present in Glasgow to discuss the issues and to consider some changes, however far those changes fall short of the protesters’ hopes.The fact that Cop26 is happening at all is a cause for optimism. If its participants arrive determined to protect their citizens’ interests and unpersuaded by the case to abandon them, no one should be surprised. At this stage in the game, we may need more than baby steps on the path to genuine reform. But even that limited progress will be jeopardised if we deplore, rather than try to understand, national governments’ priorities.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Booster jab rollout must go \u0026#39as fast as possible\u0026#39 amid fears of winter Covid surge, Boris Johnson warns Boy, 14, charged with murder of five-year-old Logan MwangiAustralian police announce £540,000 reward for information about ‘abduction’ of four-year-old girlBBC comedy costume trailer plunges into Bristol harbour10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"conservative government employed conservative solutions booster","story":"Let’s be honest, the Covid booster jab campaign is a ghastly mess. Out of nearly nine million people eligible for boosters in England alone, fewer than four million have received them. And a further 800,000 join that waiting list each week. No wonder the government’s panicking. And no wonder, after only three months of sort-of freedom, many are saying that legal pandemic restrictions must be reimposed. Oh no, please.So, what’s going wrong? It’s not vaccine hesitancy. Surveys show that 82 per cent of us would take a shot if offered – a higher rate than nearly everywhere else in Europe. And it’s not lack of supply. Around 20 million boosters are sitting in warehouses ready to be deployed.No, the problem is simply one of good old-fashioned coordination. Yet that was the very thing we got so spectacularly right in the original vaccine programme earlier in the year.But that initial rollout wasn’t managed by the NHS. Sir Patrick Vallance deliberately moved the vaccine taskforce into the Department of Business, knowing only too well that, for its undoubted strengths, the NHS is neither agile nor particularly innovative, and that getting it to change direction is like turning around a vast ocean liner in the English Channel. What we needed, instead, was a fleet of smaller, zippier boats with a Dunkirk spirit.And that’s what we got. Venture capitalist Kate Bingham led the whole enterprise, with Emily Lawson from the supermarket chain Morrisons as a deputy. Nadhim Zahawi, minister at the Department for Business, oversaw it. Retired doctors and nurses answered the country’s call, along with thousands of other public-spirited volunteers. It was like the Big Society in action, a decade after David Cameron gave up on the idea. And it delivered world-leading results, leaving a horrified, disbelieving EU trailing in our wake.None of that is the case now. Bingham, Lawson and Zahawi have moved on. Rather than giving jabs, some surgeries are now prioritising the backlog of patients needing care for other conditions – a backlog caused, of course, by the blunt instrument of big-state lockdown. And our supposedly conservative government has reached once again, with depressing inevitability, for another big-state solution, by putting the whole booster rollout into the hands of the NHS. We shouldn’t be surprised. The government raises taxes and spends money like it’s Labour in disguise. But the result is painfully slow distribution.Yet, all is not lost. The government could save the day, but only if it remembers what made the original vaccine programme so successful. It must re-employ those big-society, small-state solutions, unleashing the innovative power of the private and third sectors, getting small firms and charities to run walk-in centres, for example, as well as using community pharmacies, and creating a dedicated fleet of distribution vans zipping up and down the country like worker bees on heat. With a bit of entrepreneurial zeal, this could be just the opportunity that those no longer on furlough are looking for.Meanwhile, we need to tackle people’s understandable weariness. It’s always more difficult to climb a mountain for a second time. You can almost hear a collective groan of exhausted frustration. Do we really need to go through this all over again? Well, yes, we do. But re-energising us requires a much more compelling, positive campaign. Frankly, Sajid Javid’s blatant threats (get the jab or lose your freedom) are more likely to inspire resentment than enthusiasm.It’s a race between the virus and approaching winter on one side, and booster jabs on the other. We’re at half time, and the score’s not looking good. At the current rate, it will be next year before all those eligible for boosters receive them. That could be too late.So, will the government regain the entrepreneurial spirit of that first campaign? Will it remember what it is to be conservative? If not, the irony will be that a failure of yet another big-government initiative could lead to the ultimate big-government calamity – a catastrophic fourth national lockdown.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Booster jab rollout must go \u0026#39as fast as possible\u0026#39 amid fears of winter Covid surge, Boris Johnson warns Australian police announce £540,000 reward for information about ‘abduction’ of four-year-old girlBBC comedy costume trailer plunges into Bristol harbour10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotHalloween 2021: trick-or-treating, fancy dress costumes and why we carve pumpkins on October 31More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils told wear face masks school local health official bring","story":"Thousands of schoolchildren and students will be forced to wear masks again after an alarming rise in Covid cases in Suffolk.Worried education chiefs faced with a steady increase in infections and on Wednesday announced that from the end of the month, students in all 300 primary, secondary and colleges in the county must wear face coverings in communal areas outside the classroom.Students and staff will also have to cover their faces in communal areas outside the classroom and entry to schools will be restricted to essential visitors only. Even parents collecting children in the playground will have to wear a mask.The number of Covid cases among 10-14-year-olds has increased by almost 15 per cent and by 32 per cent among 15-19-year-olds in recent weeks in Suffolk.It means that so far in October schoolchildren in the county have lost 26,264 days of education after testing positive for Covid-19.These measures will be reviewed during the week commencing Nov 15.Stuart Keeble, Suffolk County Council\u0027s director of public health, told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that the virus is really working its way through that younger population at the moment.He said: For me now it is also about trying to keep children in school.We have had around 7,300 pupils test positive in the last 28 days. If we can keep transmission rates down, we can also keep more pupils in school as well while the vaccine is being run out for 12 to 15-year-olds.He said there is a risk if the infection starts to spread to the older population - including parents and grandparents.Mr Keeble added: We have started to see that. We have started to see an increase over the last few weeks in that parent age group of those in secondary school.He explained we are now also seeing an increase in our over-60s and this is a concern given, there are more vulnerable people in those age groups.The Government has threatened new Covid restrictions with the Health Secretary warning the public they must play their part in order to enjoy Christmas with loved ones.Sajid Javid said the Government would not implement Plan B measures such as mandatory masks, advice to work from home, and vaccine passports at this point.But ministers are coming under pressure by health officials to introduce restrictions immediately ahead of the winter and amid the rising case numbers.Health minister Edward Argar said the original plan for tackling Covid is still working.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: What Sajid (Javid, the Health Secretary) has highlighted now is that we are facing a challenging period - winter.People are indoors, infection rates are rising, and I think what he\u0027s done is levelled early with people, here is what we\u0027re seeing, but there are ways you can... the single biggest way you can impact on that and mitigate it is to have the jabs, that\u0027s the thing.Plan A in that sense, if you want to call it that, is still working. But what he highlighted is it\u0027s a race - and I\u0027ve used this phrase with you, I think, before when I\u0027ve been on your programme - it is a race between the vaccines, and getting those in people\u0027s arms, and the virus.We\u0027re still winning that race at the moment, but it\u0027s narrowing, that lead is narrowing.

Follow Covid news - live: NHS chiefs urge government to implement winter ‘plan B’Figures show that the number of people testing positive for coronavirus currently stands at more than 40,000 per day. Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus plan c household mixing","story":"Coronavirus Plan C with household mixing ban being discussed in GovernmentHealth Secretary Sajid Javid ruled out the implementation of Plan B restrictions despite soaring Covid cases, but officials are said to be discussing more drastic measuresthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video sajid-javid-warns-coronavirus-pandemic-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:milJIYgF,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Cabinet Office officials are said to be discussing proposals for a clamp down on socialising, which could form part of a “Plan C”booster jabs donapost bring the virus under control by Christmas. Health Minister Edward Argar said it wasnapost being actively considered but the Government would always look at ways to prevent the virus spiralling out of control. The Government drew up a list of Plan B contingency measures as part of efforts to fight Covid this winter, which includes ato mandatory face masks, working from home and vaccine passports. But despite rising cases, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has resisted calls to implement the measures. Mr Javid told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that the Government was focusing on getting unvaccinated Brits to come forward for their jabs and rolling out booster shots.  But he warned thatpeople fail to do their bit restrictions will be more likely in the future. Officials in the Cabinet Office’s Covid taskforce are already discussing proposals which could form part of a potential “Plan C”, which would see mixing between households banned, according to the .  A Whitehall source said: “The focus is very much on measures that can be taken without a major economic impact, so keeping shops, pubs and restaurants open but looking at other ways to reduce the risks.” The discussions are said to be at an aposearly stage,apos with insiders saying it formed part of contingency planning and would not be added to Plan B, or automatically introducedPlan B was enacted but didnapost work. The ban would be implementedpressure on hospitals worsens.  But Health Minister Edward Argar told Sky News: Thataposs not something Iaposm aware of, I checked it out and Iaposm told that is not a story with foundation. Of course as a Government you look at, as weaposve done with plan B, alternatives and ways that you mightyou needed to start easing that pressure. But the specics of that report and what was mooted in it as I understand it, as I only glanced at it Iaposm afraid on my way in this morning, about limiting household mixing, things like that ... is that it isnapost something that is being actively considered. Asked how bad the situation in the NHS would have to get before the Government moved to plan B, he said it would not be appropriate to set an arbitrary figure, X number of infections, X number of hospitalisations.  It comes after the UK recorded a seven-month high in Covid deaths on Tuesday, with fatalities up by more than % in a week. Mr Javid urged Brits to consider meeting up outdoors and also wearing masks in crowded places to prevent a further spike in cases. He said people should consider taking Covid tests before meeting up with friends and family at parties over the festive season. If they must meet indoors, he added, people should open windows in order to let in fresh air. BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the Government has taken its foot off the brake, giving the impression that the pandemic is behind us and that le has ed to normal. He said the reality of the situation is an unacceptable rate of infections, hospital admissions and deaths, which he said are unheard of in similar European nations. Dr Nagpaul added: It is wilfully negligent of the Westminster Government not to be taking any further action to reduce the spread of infection, such as mandatory mask wearing, physical distancing and ventilation requirements in high-risk settings, particularly indoor crowded spaces. These are measures that are the norm in many other nations. The ban on people from dferent households or bubbles meeting indoors was lted on May , for the first time since the New Year. At the time it was set as a maximum group of up to six people or two households - whichever was larger. The six-person limit also included babies and children, as they were not exempt. The so-called aposrule of sixapos was dropped altogether when most restrictions were canned in mid-July. The latest data on Covid case numbers reveal that on Wednesday there were a further , new cases recorded in the UK. There was also another  deaths from the disease.

The -page document had suggested “a producer-facing carbon tax” could be slapped on beef and lamb. And it proposed the government “normalise” plant-based food by offering more of it in hospital, school, prison, court, civil service and military canteens. Officials would have been encouraged to “target those learning to shop and cook for the first time, such as students.” And it could have seen a behavioural campaign to portray eating less meat as a “desirable social norm”. The document was uploaded to the government’s website yesterday as part of a Net Zero strategy and badged with the logo of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. But there was one problem - the government had already rejected the advice and it was never adopted as government policy.  The document was deleted when officials realised the blunder and the web page now says: “The information on this page has been removed because it was published in error.” A Government spokesperson said: “This was an academic research paper, not government policy. We have no plans whatsoever to dictate consumer behaviour in this way. For that reason, our Net Zero Strategy published yesterday contained no such plans.” The document, titled Net Zero: Principles for successful behaviour change initiatives, was drawn up by the Behavioural Insights Team. Formerly the Behavioural Insights Unit, the team is now run outside government. It said plant-based foods could become “the default choice in school or government public canteens and events.” “Timely moments for diet sht will include targeting those learning to shop and cook for the first time, such as students,” it added. And it suggested policy could “normalise plant-based food by integrating it through menus and shops rather than in ‘special’ aisles”.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

It went on: “Asking people directly to eat less meat and dairy is a major political challenge, though positive framings and smaller asks may be possible . “Evidence suggest highlighting health co-benefits can be more appealing than purely environmental messages . “Effort to win ‘hearts and minds’ may be better spent building public support for bold policy, such as a producer-facing carbon tax on ruminant products. “It will be important to maintain a narrative of genuine fairness to maintain public support. For example, an unsophisticated meat tax would be highly regressive. Moreover, narratives must avoid alienation of mainstream dietary choices, or demonisation of the livestock sector, which will ultimately be the solution rather than the problem.” Boris Johnson unveiled more details of the UK’s plan to reach Net Zero carbon emissions by .

The -page blueprint lays out the Governmentaposs plans to meet legal targets to cut emissions to net zero by  in a bid to tackle dangerous climate change. Climate advisers do not think peopleaposs lives will be that dferent under the plans. Brits will still be flying, eating meat, warming their homes and going to work in the coming decades. But some big changes will be required to day-to-day le to get the UK on track to hit the targets. As the Government scrambles to prepare for COP climate summit in Glasgow, we look at how the sht to net zero will impact on your le. Homes One of the main things that will change is how we heat our homes, moving away from gas and other fossil fuels for heating and hot water, and cooking. For many people that will mean a switch from a boiler to a heat pump, installed in inidual houses and powered by electricity, working a bit like a fridge in reverse to generate heat from the outside air, or sometimes the ground. In cities, district heat networks, which pipe hot water underground to bring heat to homes from a central source, such as the energy from a waste plant, rivers, or even former mines, to heat exchangers instead of boilers in inidual homes could be the answer. And in some places, where hydrogen is being manufactured as a clean alternative to fossil fuels for industry, HGVs and other uses, it could be put through the gas pipe network to heat nearby homes with compatible new boilers. All heating technologies are more efficient at heating a home - and reducing energy demand and bills -homes are well insulated. So campaigners have called for a major energy efficiency programme to make houses much cosier than today, with double or triple glazing, draught proofing and high levels of loft and wall insulation.  Travel Transport is currently the biggest single source of emissions, so those will have to be tackled, and a key way to do that is switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles. By the s, new cars will all be electric, andyou have off-street parking, you will be able to charge your car on your front drive rather than having to refuel at a petrol station. But while the range - the number of miles a car can do on a single charge - is increasing, the infrastructure to allow people to charge up on long journeys or on the street will need to improve. And itaposs not just about switching the type of vehicle you drive. Part of the picture will be cutting the number of journeys taken by car and increasing the number of people in a vehicle, as well as ensuring more walking and cycling and better provision for both. That will make towns and cities less polluted and more liveable, while people could be healthier because they are getting more exercise.  Projections by the independent advisory Climate Change Committee do not include a cut in flying, but instead a reduction in the growth in demand for flights, and the Government is pushing development of more sustainable fuels. But the Climate Assembly - a group of more than  citizens from around the country convened by Parliament to discuss how we cut our emissions to zero - did support some kind of frequent flyer levy to charge the small proportion of people who take lots of flights. The changes in working, such as more video conferencing, brought on by the pandemic, could be here to stay, cutting business travel and commuting. Diets The Climate Change Committee says we should be eating a fth less meat by . As well as cutting emissions from livestock, the move will free up land to grow energy crops or create forests that soak up excess carbon emissions and provide habitat for wildle which is also in crisis. The Government has said it will not tell people what to eat as part of its efforts to reach net zero, working with the grain of consumer choice, although it does see a slight reduction in line with current trends. The committee says its recommendations for curbing meat consumption are well within the Governmentaposs own guidelines for healthy eating.  Jobs This is another key area where things are going to change for some people, as jobs in high-carbon industries go and green jobs are created instead. This could include jobs in sectors such as manufacturing electric cars, and zero-carbon steel, boiler fitters retraining as heat pump engineers, or workers in the offshore oil and gas industry taking new jobs in the offshore wind sector. But that means there must be support, retraining and re-skilling for workers in high-carbon sectors so they are not left behind in the move to a green economy. Costs How much all of this will cost for iniduals and families is a big question, with the Treasury warning that the costs - and the benefits - will not fall equally among households, and policies will be needed to reduce the costs and spread the burden fairly. Some new technologies are signicantly more expensive, such as heat pumps, prompting the Government to bring in grants to reduce the costs, but the hope is prices will fall as markets scale up.

The Department for International Tradesaid the “groundbreaking” agreement will cut the price of New Zealand sauvignon blanc wine by p - which is its current tarf - and make Manuka honey and kiwi fruits cheaper.  It will also create more chances for Britons to live and work in New Zealand - and “deeper cooperation on digital trade and climate change”, the ministry said.However, critics have pointed out DIT’s own -page analysis of its aims for a New Zealand free trade agreement produced in June .It said: “A trade agreement with New Zealand could have limited effects on UK GDP in the long run [ years], with the estimated impact on GDP being close to zero under both scenarios compared to the UK not having a trade deal with New Zealand .” It also suggested agriculture could see a reduction in output and employment, as “UK market access in these sectors increases and resources move towards the expanding sectors.” The analysis did add that the economy would grow overall on a dferent measure known as “Gross Value Added ”, and “productivity gains are expected to drive increases in takehome pay for workers.” But Shadow Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry questioned the benefits of the deal today in the House of Commons. She asked: “Is it correct, as her department says ... that New Zealandaposs exports to the UK will increase by five times as much as UK exports to New Zealand  “And that New Zealandaposs GDP ... will grow by half a billion pounds while the UKaposs GDP will not increase by a single penny ” Trade minister Penny Mordaunt replied: Missing from the right honourable question was any timeframe.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

What the opposition need to appreciate is that we are building these markets. We are increasing these markets and over time those numbers will go up. They will go up because we have given our businesses and our farmers the opportunity to do that. But they will also go up because we have faith in those businesses and farmers thatwe give them those opportunities they will seize them. AskedDIT was still forecasting a cut in “output and employment” for British farmers, International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan replied: I am very confident that the deal we have struck will provide the opportunity for our wonderful food producers to continue to sell their goods across the world and, as we make more trade deals, creating new markets for them also. But she refused to be drawn on whether the June  forecast was still correct. UK-New Zealand trade was worth £.billion last year and is expected to grow under the deal.  However, it was unclear what the agreement means for imports of New Zealand lamb. Welsh farmers fear cheap lamb from Down Under on British supermarket shelves could hammer the UK’s sheep farming industry. International Trade Committee Chair, Angus Brendan MacNeil, said: “While the prospect of increased trade with our friends in New Zealand is welcome, the devil of this agreement will be in the detail. “My Committee will be looking underneath the bonnet and kicking the tyres to find out how far the Government has achieved its stated ambitions, exploring whether this represents a good deal for all sectors of the UK economy and all parts of the country.” Comment MORE ON Penny MordauntBoris JohnsonEmily ThornberryInternational TradeHouse of CommonsClimate changeBritish economyThe economyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Health Secretary made the claim at a No press conference last night, despite deaths hitting  in the last week.One Labour MP said it showed a sickening disregard for all the lives being lost.But Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said today: He was simply pointing out that on a purely factual basis the number of deaths per day is signicantly lower than we have seen at the peak, when we didn’t have the protection of our vaccine programme, and the greater treatment. Told the Health Secretary was not, in fact, doing that, Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman replied: Like I say, every death is clearly a tragedy. It is factually accurate that deaths are signicantly lower thanks to our vaccine rollout.  Askedthe Prime Minister agreed with Mr Javid, the spokesman said: Every single death that’s taken place during this pandemic is a tragedy. And the government continues to do everything possible to protect lives and take action where necessary to ensure lives are protected. And of course protect livelihoods as well and we’ll continue to do so. Mr Javid made the comment last night as he warned Covid cases could soon top , a day. He said: The NHS is performing with distinction, and I’d like to thank everyone who’s working so hard to keep us safe. And we’ll do what it takes to make sure that this pressure doesn’t become unsustainable and that we don’t allow the NHS to become overwhelmed. Deaths remain mercully low, but they are still sadly over  a day. This pandemic is not over.  Thanks to the vaccination programme, yes, the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths has signicantly weakened, but it’s not broken. So we must all remember that this virus will be with us for the long term, and that it remains a threat. UK deaths within  days of a positive test reached a peak of more than , a day at the height of the second wave. Shadow health minister Justin Madders tweeted last night: Since the start of September there have been , deaths from covid.That is more than the total deaths for April, May, June, July and August combined. That is not mercully low Sajid Javid.Labour MP Richard Burgon added: Sajid Javid just described Covid deaths as mercully low. Current daily Covid death figures are equivalent to over , deaths per year. This shows a sickening disregard for all the lives being lost. Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice said: The health secretary has a track record of flippantly causing hurt to those of us who lost loved ones, whether it be implying our loved ones cowered from the virus or the idea that newly , loved ones losing their lives each week is mercully low. Perhapshe would at long last meet with us he could have it explained exactly why his words were in such poor taste  “A long time ago experts suggested , deaths would be a good outcome but here we are,  deaths a week and over , dead with the virus - in what world is this mercully low  “The only mercy many of us have received were NHS staff helping us say good bye to our loved ones. “Sajid Javid needs to choose his words more carefully, perhaps he could start by saying he will now implement a plan B to save lives and will meet with us to learn the lessons from our loved ones losses  Mr Javid and No refused to implement Plan B, which would see compulsory masks and vaccine passports in some spaces, despite NHS chiefs begging for action now. No admitted the NHS faces a very challenging winter but claimed it is not under signicant pressure yet. A spokesman also refused to say how many deaths it might take to kick in Plan B. “We don’t put a specic threshold on a particular metric because things need to be looked at in the round, focusing too much on one particular metric would be unhelpful and can be misleading in some circumstances, he said. But Carol Popplestone of the Royal College of Nursing said: The pressure on services is already unsafe and unsustainable and is heading in one clear direction. Denying the problem does not help patients nor staff.  “Next week’s Budget is a chance for government to put both long and short-term investment into health and care services.”But Mr Javid warned restrictions are more likely toduring Christmaspeople fail to wear masks when appropriate. That is despite many Tory MPs not wearing masks in the Commons chamber. On reports household mixing could be restricted under a Plan C, a No spokesman said: Neither ministers nor officials are working on those proposals, that’s not accurate. You’ve seen Plan B… that is what we would move to as a next steprequired.

His comments came just hours after ministers gathered in the Commons for PMQsSajid Javid said people should wear face masks in enclosed spaces Image: Getty ImagesByChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsSajid Javid has said the public should wear a face mask to think about others around them in some enclosed settings just hours after Tory MPs packed into the House of Commons without them. The Health Secretary, who did not wear a face mask in the Commons today, urged people to consider wearing a mask in busy places such as public transport but did not make them compulsory again. At tonightaposs press conference, he said: There are many things we can all do, like wearing face coverings in crowded or close spaces.His comments came just hours after ministers gathered in the Commons for Prime Ministeraposs Questionsand most Tory MPs did not wear a face mask when sitting next to others. Mr Javid came under fire over his colleaguesapos behaviour - and one Tory MPaposs plans to hold a Christmas party - during todayaposs Downing Street press conference.  He responded to a question about their actions contradicting official advice by saying aposI think thataposs a very fair pointapos. Weaposve all got a role to play and set an example to set as private iniduals as well. Itaposs a very fair point and Iaposm sure a lot of people have heard you, he added. Mr Javid added that the Government is not currently planning to implement its Plan B for tackling coronavirus, adding that ministers do not believe the pressures on the NHS are unsustainable at the moment. Responding to questions, he said: “You said, am I sayingwe don’t do our bit, get vaccinated, all those behavioural changes we can make, that we are more likely to face restrictions as we head into winter - then I am saying that. “I think we’ve been really clear that we’ve all got a role to play. “If not enough people get their booster jabs,not enough of those people who were eligible for the original offer - the million that remain unvaccinated -they don’t come forward. “If people don’t wear masks when they really should in a really crowded place with lots of people they don’t normally hang out with. “If they’re not washing their hands and stuff - it’s going to hit us all. and it would of course make it more likely we’re going to have more restrictions.“Now we want to avoid those, we’ve set out what those restrictions might look like, we’ve set out the Plan B restrictions for example, and we all want to avoid those.”In his first-ever Downing Street press conference, Sajid Javid repeated his warning that Covid- cases could reach , a day as the country enters a challenging winter period.He said the UK was seeing greater pressure on the NHS but said the Government will do what it takes to make sure that this pressure doesnapost become unsustainable and that we donapost allow the NHS to become overwhelmed. He said deaths remain mercully low at the moment, even though in the past week almost a thousand people died after contracting the disease. He added: Weaposve always known that the winter months would pose the greatest threat to our road to recovery.  He added: Thanks to the vaccination programme, the link between hospitalisations and deaths has signicantly weakened, but itaposs not broken. So we must all remember that this virus will be with us for the long term and remains a threat to our loved ones, and a threat to the progress that weaposve made in getting our nation closer to normal le. The latest Government figures show that a further  people have died within  days of testing positive for Covid- as of Wednesday. As of am on Wednesday, there have been a further , lab-confirmed Covid- cases in the UK. Hospital admissions stand at  on average per day over the last seven days, up from  a week earlier, a rise of  per cent.  Earlier, Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation which represents health bodies, warned that we risk stumbling into a winter crisis unless measures such as face masks and vaccine passports - the Governmentaposs Plan B for the coming months - are introduced in England. He called for ministers to come up with a Plan C of even tougher restrictionsthose measures are insufficient to address pressure on the health service. A behavioural expert has predicted thatthe Government made face masks compulsory again, most people in England would follow the rule.  Professor Linda Bauld said the nation is the outlier in the UK when it comes to coronavirus safety measures, as many aspects included in the Westminster Governmentaposs Plan B are already in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The behavioural scientist, who is Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, said the main issue is communication and added that making something mandatory is a big sht which sends a message that people need to comply. Under the Governmentaposs current Plan A strategy, people in England are advised to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed settings but it is not a legal requirement. Prof Bauld said it is striking and very unfortunate that most Conservative MPs sit in the House of Commons without masks, compared with those on the opposition benches who have generally been seen to wear face coverings. She said: Leaders need to lead by example and with thesenumbers and the concerns we have, absolutely, I think politicians from all parties should be wearing a face covering when theyaposre in the chamber, when they canapost distance etc. Itaposs social norms that drive these behaviours. When you mandate something, itaposs a big sht, it sends a message that itaposs expected and therefore you need to comply unless thereaposs an exception. She added: I think there are some people who feel quite comfortable still wearing one and donapost care what anybody  thinks, but there are others who do , and so, therefore, I think just saying we recommend it but itaposs not required isnapost strong enough. It just doesnapost really work.

The move could mean the p charge on plastic carriers could be replicated for many other things, such as coffee stirrers and straws. Ministers are set to announce the new green powers in the Commons on Wednesday.It comes as Boris Johnson prepares to host the UN COP climate change summit in Glasgow later this month.It is hoped the charges will nudge consumers to use more sustainable items, after the plastic carrier bag charge cut sales in main supermarkets by %. The bill already contained laws to make it easier for ministers to introduce charges on single-use plastics, but the amendments push to introduce charges on all single-use products. “This change to the Environment Bill will mean we can put an end to ‘here-today gone-tomorrow’ throwaway culture and move towards sustainable alternatives,” a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs source has said. The campaign has been led by Labour ’s Shadow Environment Minister Baroness Jones of Whitchurch, who has been pushing for the change in the Government’s flagship Environment Bill.“This concession is an important first step in reducing our reliance on single-use items, which have an environmental cost whether they are made out of plastic or other materials such as wood, she told The i paper. “While we have welcomed the Government’s incremental bans on certain plastic items, it is clear that ministers need a wider range of tools to tackle the throw-away culture that creates unnecessary waste and litter.” Ruth Chambers of the Greener UK coalition said: “This is very welcome news. “A plastics only measure would have simply moved producers and consumers to single use alternatives that are often unrecyclable. “It is right that the Environment Bill should tackle our throwaway culture head on.” The levy on plastic carrier bags increased to p from p on May  and now applies to every retailer, from giant supermarket chains to corner shops, small clothes boutiques, butchers, greengrocers and airport duty-free stores Before this, the p levy only applied only to shops with more than  staff but it has resulted in the average person in England buying just four bags a year from the big store chains – a massive reduction from  bags each in . While it is thought the new scheme for all single-use items could be similar, the full details are not yet known.

From abusive behaviour that causes real damage and shuts down debate to the extremism that spreads terrying ideas and incites people to commit murder. After a three year delay, the Conservatives’ promised draft Bill has finally been published but it’s weak, ineffective and won’t do the job we need it to do.As the testimony from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen has shown, making money is all these companies care about.Facebook knew its app was damaging children’s mental health but chose to do nothing. Imaginea drugs company was selling something that made kids sick or a toy firm was selling dangerous a product, they would rightly suffer severe consequences.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  The first change we need in the Bill is to include criminal sanctions against the senior executives of the big companies for repeated breaches of the new law. We need a strong incentive to change the culture of those companies and how they operate. Without personal liability, nothing will change. And we know this works, we have it in health and safety law and in banking. Itaposs not good enough that the Conservatives left this out of their draft Bill.And it should not have taken Keir Starmer to push on this at PMQs for Boris Johnson to perform a U-turn.Another big omission from the Bill is a tough rule around legal but harmful content like racist abuse suffered by our footballers, misogyny suffered by just about any woman in public le and other abuse that makes le a misery but doesn’t hit a criminal threshold.  We need a tough duty of care on the companies which covers all that abuse because it can’t be left up to social media companies to self police it. They have already shown they can’t, or won’t do it voluntarily.After England lost the Euros final, Instagram said that monkey emojis used to attack Saka and other black players did not breach its rules. So self regulation by these companies has had its day. Finally there is a big worry that this Bill has a two tier approach to digital s putting tougher rules in place for the big “category ” sites like Facebook and Twitter but putting less stringent rules in place for the smaller sites.But as Hope Not Hate and the Anti Semitism Policy Trust and others have warned, it’s often the smaller s that host the most terrying and dangerous content with Twitter and Facebook acting as a shop window for the more extreme material. Labour believes this needs to be addressed because excluding these sites from stronger rules is playing into the hands of those who want to spread this dangerous extremism.On Wednesday, under pressure from Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister promised to bring in criminal sanctions and to bring forward the second reading of the Bill before Christmas. We will be holding him to these promises. We need our laws in place as soon as possible and for them to be effective to make all our online lives safer. Because we know from bitter experience that harms against people online can quickly move offline.

Sajid Javid appealed to the public to wear masks in enclosed spaces to curb rising infection rates and admitted that MPs should lead the way in Parliament.At a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, Mr Javid was pressed on whether MPs should have donned face coverings at Prime Ministeraposs Questions in the packed Commons chamber. He replied: “I think that is a very fair point. As I say, we’ve all got our role to play in this. But some MPs were still flouting the advice on Thursday morning.  When the Mirror did a headcount at .am, we saw  MPs on the government benches - seven with masks and seven without. By comparison there were  MPs on the opposition benches,  with masks and one without.Tory MPs wearing masks included Jeremy Hunt while those without masks included lockdown sceptic MPs Desmond Swayne and Mark Harper.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said: “It is utter hypocrisy that the public are rightfully being advised to wear masks while Conservative MPs refuse to do so. “The very same day that Sajid Javid was urging the public to take steps to protect themselves against the virus, Conservative MPs were laid across the green benches maskless and irresponsible.In the Commons, Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup said she was wearing her mask “out of choice because it’s the right thing to do”, when pressed on the issue by the SNP ’s Peter Grant.Tory former minister Dr Andrew Murrison challenged the minister on the obsession with non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mask wearing, which he claimed would obscure the focus on the vaccination programme.  Lockdown-sceptic backbencher Sir Desmond Swayne also said the mask would deny us the fellowship and reassurance of her friendly facial expression. Ms Throup replied: I look forward to the time we donapost need to wear face coverings because I love to see everyoneaposs smiling faces, but we do need to make sure that we all get jabbed so we can get to that stage. On masks, she said: Plan A outlines the guidance that we have in place and thataposs the guidance that people should be following, and itaposs up to iniduals to work out what works for them and whataposs best for them. Plan B incorporates mandatory wearing of masks but weaposre on plan A. Earlier, Shadow Culture Secretary Jo Stevens said the vast majority of opposition MPs have been wearing masks throughout.She told TimesRadio it appeared that Tory MPs were being whippednot to wear masks in the Chamber.I donapost understand why Conservative Party MPs... it almost felt like they were being whipped not to wear masks in the chamber. I donapost know whether they were or not but itaposs been a very odd situation. Finally, last night Sajid Javid was saying he would recommend that people wear masks and yet his government colleagues and fellow Tory MPs donapost wear them. Downing Street stopped short of backing Mr Javidaposs call for MPs to wear masks in the crowded Commons chamber. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: It remains the case that itaposs a matter of personal judgment for all iniduals on wearing a mask. We have very clear guidance which sets out that people are recommended to wear face coverings in crowded, enclosed spaces where they come into contact with people they do not normally meet. Jacob Rees-Mogg also refused to back the calls - and claimed Tories didnapost need to wear them as they know each other and have a convivial fraternal spirit. The Tory Commons Leader said: There is no advice to wear face masks in workplaces. The advice on crowded spaces is with crowded spaces with people that you donapost know. We on this side know each other. He joked that it may be that the honourable gentleman doesnapost like mixing with his own side, adding but we on this side have a more convivial, fraternal spirit, and therefore are following the guidance of Her Majestyaposs Government.

Doctors accused ministers of being wilfully negligent by failing to implement Covid Plan B, which would see theof masks, working from home and use of vaccine passports.Health Secretary Sajid Javid claimed that the NHS was facing a sustainable level of pressure as the winter approaches and said further curbs would not be brought in at the moment.But he raised the threat of new restrictions before Christmaspeople didnapost get their booster jabs. It comes as Cabinet Office officials were said to be discussing plans to curb household mixing - which could form part of a “Plan C” -booster jabs donapost bring the virus under control.  Health Minister Ed Argar said plan C was not being actively considered and insisted current measures are working. Boris Johnson insisted that Government was sticking with its winter Covid plan despite the high number of infections. Speaking during a visit to a school in County Antrim, the Prime Minister said: The numbers of infections are high but weaposre within the parameters of what the predictions were. We are continuing with the plan we set out in July. We are watching the numbers very carefully every day, he said. The numbers of infections are high but we are within the parameters of what the predictions were, what Spi-Mand the others said we would be at this stage given the steps we are taking. We are sticking with our plan. But thereaposs an almighty row brewing over whether the Government is on course to repeat last yearaposs mistakes by taking lockdown measures too late in the face of spiralling infections. Hereaposs what we know about the plans to battle the virus this winter. What is the Covid winter plan  The Government published a blueprint on how it intends to battle Covid over the colder months in September. The UK is currently following Plan A, which relies on booster jabs for the over-s and other vulnerable groups, as well as jabs to  to -year-olds to keep the virus at bay. It also advises people to wear masks in enclosed spaces, although it is not mandatory. But there are mounting fears that the booster programme is moving too slowly, with reports of chaotic rollouts for in care homes. And infections have been on the rise, with , cases as of am on Wednesday. Hospital admissions stand at  on average per day over the last seven days, up from  a week earlier, a rise of %. Scientic experts have warned that the UK is probably already close to , cases a day. The worrying figures have prompted calls for the Government to do more to curb the spread of the virus.  What is aposPlan Bapos  The -page Winter plan contains a list of tougher measures known as Plan B, which will be deployedthe NHS in England comes under unsustainable pressure. Masks would become mandatory in certain settings, and vaccine passports would be made a legal requirement for nightclubs, outdoor festivals and football matches. Brits could be ordered to work from home againthey can, and there will be public information campaigns to communicate the change of risk to the public. What needs to happen to move to aposPlan Bapos  The Government has refused to say explicitly - but we can take some educated guesses. The aim of the Covid winter plan is to ensure the NHS does not come under unsustainable pressure. This means keeping a close eye on the number of people being hospitalised with the virus, as well as whether the link between infections and hospitalisations remains weak. Vaccine efficacy is also key as the success of the UKaposs vaccine rollout has been crucial to easing Covid restrictions. The presence of any deadly new iants is also a key factor, so ministers are keeping a close eye on a new strain called AY.., which some are calling Delta Plus.Plan B might not all be imposed at onceministers do hit go on the plan. Boris Johnson previously described it as a number of dferent shots in the lockercases started rising. What is aposPlan Capos - and will household mixing be banned  Cabinet Office officials are said to be discussing a ban on household mixing before Christmasboosters fail to bring the virus under control. Health Minister Edward Argar said the plan wasnapost being actively considered but the Government would always look at ways to prevent the virus spiralling out of control. But a Whitehall source told the : The focus is very much on measures that can be taken without a major economic impact, so keeping shops, pubs and restaurants open but looking at other ways to reduce the risks.” Downing Street insisted neither ministers or officials are working on those proposals and there were no plans to move to Plan B at the moment. The national ban on indoor meet-ups was lted on May  after being in place for the last lockdown. It remained in place after shops and pubs reopened as experts suggested people were more likely to ignore social distancing guidancethey are at home with their friends and loved ones. What about foreign travel  Rules around international travel have just been relaxed, with the old traffic light rules scrapped and replaced with a single red list. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also announced that day  PCR tests can be replaced with cheaper lateral flows from next week, to make holidays cheaper for families. None of this gives a sense that the Government is planning to scrap foreign travel again and there is no mention of ending overseas travel in the winter plan. Will there be another lockdown  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was the latest top Tory to rule out ato a national lockdown. Boris Johnson is desperate to avoid a lockdown - and it would only ever be imposed as a last resort due to the widespread disruption to peopleaposs lives. Working from home is one of the big levers the Government can pull to reduce the spread of the virus, as well as banning household mixing. It is likely that these measures would be imposed before the Government even considered a full lockdown. And remember - we didnapost have the vaccine last winter, which is the best protection we have against the virus.

The COP summit is taking place between October  and November , with more than , delegates set to attend.Politicians are expected to thrash out deals which will help countries tackle climate change and limit global temperature changes to .C. The Queen, Sir David Attenborough, Barack Obama and Joe Biden are just a few of the major figures expected to appear at the summit. Here are the  things you need to know about COP: What is COP  COP stands for ‘conference of the parties’, the annual meeting of the countries that are members of the UN Climate Convention. These meetings have taken place since the convention was set up in Rio, Brazil, in . Since then, negotiators from most countries decide what actions need to be taken under international law to protect the climate.  COP takes place from October  – November  in Glasgow, Scotland, and is the UK’s first time playing host, in partnership with Italy. It was originally planned for November , but the pandemic forced a reschedule. The conference is opening a day earlier than planned, because of Covid-. The talks are scheduled to end at pm on Friday  November, but past experience of Cops shows they are likely to extend into the Saturday or even Sunday. Who will attend  More than , delegates from  countries will descend on Glasgow from October st, alongside some  heads of state. The world leaders, around  expected, will gather in the first few days and then depart leaving the complex negotiations to their representatives. The UK is expecting a full house from the EU - including a last hurrah for Merkel - while Biden is bringing  cabinet members and Barack Obama.  Canada, Australia, Korea, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Argentina are among others confirmed. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are some of the world leaders who are understood not to have confirmed their attendance in Glasgow, despite the Prime Minister calling on the country to put forward ambitious targets in a call last week. Ramaphosa and Japanaposs new PM Kishida have local elections so may miss out. North Korea Ambassador Choe Il will make the trip. Up to , climate activists, influencers and experts are also expected to show up. That includes broadcaster and natural historian Sir David Attenborough, who will address world leaders as a people’s advocate.The Queen will attend COP along with former U.S. President Barack Obama who will join current president Joe Biden. In a U-turn, so will youth climate activist Greta Thunberg. Thunberg previously refused to attend due to concerns that delegates from poorer countries would not be able to go to the event due to a lack of access to COVID- vaccines.Thousands of demonstrators are also expected.  Why is Cop important  This is the first COP since the Paris Agreement, which set out to radically decrease emissions, which will see membersto the table to state exactly what they are going to do. Adopted in , it is a landmark agreement to combat climate change unites all the worldaposs nations in a single agreement for the first time in history. The Key points were to keep global temperatures well below .Cabove pre-industrial times and endeavour to limit them even more, to .C. Also to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between  and . So far  countries and the EU have revised their actions - also known as National Determined Contributions . These have to be revisited every five years and COP marks the deadline, which has already been extended as a result of the pandemic. What is hoped to be achieved in Glasgow  It is broadly accepted there are three headline targets for COP: To keep .C in reach by ensuring all major polluters deliver new plans.

How warm is it now  Temperatures around the world are already at about . – .C above pre-industrial levels, and greenhouse gas emissions are still on an upward trend.  Will this impact the UK Yes.

It also said that climate change is unequivocally being driven by human activity, which fuels these extreme weather patterns. What happensCop fails “COP was always going to be extremely tough, UK PM Boris Johnson told Bloomberg this week.The big players in the talks – the UN, the UK, the US – have already conceded that Cop will not achieve everything that was hoped for as the NDCs likely to emerge will not add up to all that is needed to ensure the world remains within .C.  That is disappointing for many observers, but is not a surprise given the complexity of the negotiations. China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are the G nations yet to submit anything pre COP - although to give Ankara credit, they have finally signed up to the Paris Agreement six years after it was agreed What the UK hosts are now focused on is ensuring that there is enough progress on emissions cuts for  to “keep .C alive”, and to pursue as many other routes – phasing out coal, cutting methane and setting a path away from fossil fuels for transport etc. November Rain Tensions are rising as Cop approaches with rail workers and waste collectors going on strike, Airbnb are screwing over customers who have already booked accommodation in the city by asking for more money and Covid rates are rising.  Speaking for a planet, even the Queen piled in: “It is very irritating when they talk, but they donapost do,” she said, in a nod to national climate plansyet to land. Can I go to COP  Yes and no. In order to attend, only accredited delegates, media and politicians will have access to what is known as the Blue Zone - the area of venue managed by the UN.COPs also have a green zone, managed by the Presidency, with events for the wider public.

The NHS trusts treating the highest number of Covid patients on Tuesday last week were:University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust - , down from  a month earlier Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust - , the same as a month earlier Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust - , down from  a month earlier University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust - , up from  a month earlier University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust - , down from  a month earlier Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust - , up from  a month earlier Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust - , down from  a month earlier County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust - , up from  a month earlier Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust - , down from  a month earlier Barts Health NHS Trust- , down from  a month earlier Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust - , down from  a month earlier Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust - , down from  a month earlier Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust - , up from  a month earlier London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust - , down from  a month earlier The Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust - , up from  a month earlier Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust - , down from  a month earlier Kingaposs College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust - , down from  a month earlier South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust - , down from  a month earlier Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust - , up from  a month earlierImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust - , down from  a month earlierDespite calls from the NHS Confederation to impose a ‘Plan B’ now or face an NHS crisis, Mr Javid was adamant that it was not necessary. He said the NHS was not yet under “unsustainable” pressure and called on Brits to show their “Blitz spirit” and get their booster Covid jab. Mr Javid said: I’ve got a lot of time for the NHS Confederation… they do a lot of good work. On this particular question we don’t believe the pressures currently faced by the NHS are unsustainable.  Donapost get me wrong, there are huge pressures, especially in AE, in primary care for example as well. But at this point we donapost believe they are unsustainable. The Health Secretary did call upon people to continue to wear face masks in enclosed spaces but refused to make doing so compulsory. Many are concerned of another tough winter as Covid surges and that any government action may come too late to make a meaningful dference. Mr Javid warned that restrictions would “of course” Brits did not wear masks or get their booster jabs when able to.Yesterday experts warned that the governmentaposs Plan B needs to be strengthened to avert disaster. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, public health researcher at the Queen Mary University of London, said thousands of lives could be saved in coming weeks - but the governmentaposs plan does not go far enough. Dr Gurdasani told The Mirror that compulsory isolation for schoolchildren who have been exposed to Covid and the closure of poorly-ventilated venues like nightclubs over the winter must be considered. She said that at the current rate a further , lives could be lost to Covid in the two months to Christmas. Dr Gurdasani said: We need to remember that the NHS is in crisis, healthcare doctors will tell you that. Thereaposs very little leeway, emergency response times are high pretty much all across England. Right now people canapost get emergency care, which means avoidable deaths. Most people donapost realise that weaposre an exception to the rest of the world who arenapost tolerating this level of deaths.

Dr Amy Kavanagh, who has been visually impaired since birth, was paired with her Ava a year ago but despite her dog’s training she says they are regularly put in danger by passers-by wanting to fuss over the animal. She shared her experiences and has even recorded a video from Avaaposs point of view after Guide Dogs revealed figures that show % of guide dog owners claim their dog is distracted by strangers at least once a day and % said it happens at least once a week. This comes as new figures from the Guide Dogs charity revealed that % of owners claim their dog is distracted by strangers at least once a day, and % said it happens at least once a week.  The charity also polled the public and found three in  Brits freely admitted to stopping and interrupting a guide dog while it was working by petting it. Dr Kavangh said: People will try and pet her or whistle at her while she is working and it can be confusing for me because she is my eyes. If she stops and does a dferent movement, I can think itaposs because of a hazard like a set of steps or a car on the pavement and it can be really stressful or frightening.” Dr Kavangh said that Ava sometimes has “a little cry” after getting distracted because the guide dog becomes distressed.  Dr Kavanagh said someone tries to love Ava pretty much every time the pair are out. She added: I had a woman pet her earlier this week just as Ava was showing me where the gap was at a train . That is the real risk and not to sound dramatic but we could die. She could be stopping me walking out in front of cars or falling down the stairs. She explained how it was “a bit entitled” that people put their desire to play with a dog over her boundaries and safety. Dr Kavanagh understood sometimes it came from a place of kindness, as people think Ava is always working. She said: Sheaposs my baby. She doesnapost usually work more than three hours a day and she has toys and treats and we go for off-lead walks and I take my cane and she can play.

Angela Artis, , was travelling back to Charlotte, in the US, with husband Darien and son Mason when they were forced off the plane at Heathrow where they were making a connection. Their holiday to Santorini, in Greece, where the couple were renewing their wedding vows, turned sour on thevia Heathrow. After being removed from the American Airlines flight  last Sunday, the airline provided overnight accommodation and rebooked the Artis family onto the following day’s flight. Mrs Artis claimed it was impossible to keep a mask on a two-year-old and that there was a baby near them that wasn’t forced to wear a face covering.  She said having got on board the plane initially everything was fine with the flight crew and her son was even given a lollipop. It turned sour, she claimed, when another flight attendant came over.She told the: “But about  minutes before the flight was due to take off another attendant came over and pointed a finger at my baby. She said aposhe needs to put a mask on or he’s got to go” in a very rude way.Mrs Artis said that her heart dropped as she had no idea it was a strict policy because she claimed that she had been able to travel before without him wearing a mask. Mrs Artis added that other flight crew in the past have accepted it is not feasible to keep the mask on a two-year-old “for more than five minutes”. She said: We had tried to put it on him for the first few minutes but he just couldn’t keep it on, it’s dficult for a baby to even physically breathe with a mask on. She said that the plane then taxied back to the terminal and the family was forced to get off the plan with an announcement that it was due to a child not wearing a mask. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Transportation Security Administration directives mean that American Airlines requires passengers aged two and older to wear face coverings at all times while indoors at airports and onboard. In a statement, the airline said: On Oct. , American Airlines flight  ed to the gate prior to departure from London Heathrow to deplane a party failing to comply with the face mask requirement. After agreeing to comply with the face mask requirement, all iniduals were rebooked for travel on the next flight to Charlotte the following day.

Their daughter Posie-Aurora Sadler-Smith, one, recently took her first steps - on her new prosthetic limbs after having an amputation. The tot was diagnosed with fibular hemimelia upon birth. The disability - where part or all of the fibula is missing - usually only impacts one leg, but Posie was missing nearly all the bones from both her lower limbs. But Posie defied the odds and learnt to crawl, using all her upper body strength to toddle around, and even boost herself on the sofa for a cuddle with pooch Seuss.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Her parents faced the agonising decision on whether to amputate her limbs - in order to give her a chance at walking upright. And just after her first birthday, Posie had her left leg amputated at the ankle and was later fitted with prosthetic limbs - in her favourite shade of pink, naturally. She left her parents in floods of tears after taking her first tentative tiny steps, with her dadaposs support, later that day. Parents Jodie Weeder, , and partner Dominic Sadler-Smith, , admit they miss her perfect little toes but are in awe of their daughteraposs strength.  Jodie from Sudbury, Suffolk, said: When they strapped them on at the fitting it was like she suddenly wasnapost a baby anymore. She went suddenly from this little dinky girl to such a tall toddler. We never thought we would see her stand up. It was amazing. Prosthetics take a lot of getting used to, but It was amazing to see her stand up for the first time. She canapost stand on her own with them yet because the right one needs to be altered, so we have to hold her or she holds the furniture. Sheaposs incredible. Her upper body strength is amazing - sheaposs like a little Hulk. She fallsshe lets go, but she wonapost give up. She just gets up again. Sheaposll just try and try. Jodie, who has a cleaning business, and businessman Dominic, didnapost know whether their little girl would ever walk when they found she had a chromosomal condition at  weeks pregnant. We could have had a termination, but we werenapost giving up on her Jodie said. We just focussed on getting her here and thought: aposweaposll face whatever we faceapos. At birth, she was diagnosed with fibular hemimelia. She had no right knee or bones below it, and no left ankle with only one misshaped bone in that leg. Around one-in-fty-thousand little ones have the bone condition, but itaposs much rarer for both legs to be affected.She had to wear a brace to reposition her hips for three months. Determined Posie developed a speedy crawl at six months, and had her left foot amputated on July . Her right one remains but is shorter and missing toes. Emotional parents Jodie and Dominic watched as their only child stood for the first time when she got her first prosthetic legs on September . Her right knee is so unstable she canapost stand on her own yet, so doctors will help the family decide whether it would help Posie to amputate the right leg at her knee in October, to help her prosthetics fit better. Jodie said: Prosthetics take a lot of adjustment and getting used to: you donapost just pop them on for the first time and walk. As long as youaposve got the right support around you and people who love you are backing you you can do anything. There will always be hurdles out there in anyoneaposs le: youaposve just got to overcome them. Now the family will be walking  miles in two months, over weekends, with Posie in the pram, to raise money for the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, where she was helped.Click here to donate.Comment MORE ON HospitalsPregnancyMirror More Hopeful\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That first swim was really memorable, I came out of the water feeling revived and invigorated, and I knew I was a convert.’ Jenny persuaded three friends to form a wild swim gang with her and since August they have met weekly for a dip. ‘I don’t wear a wetsuit, it’s too much faff getting in and out of one, just a swimsuit and now I look forward to my swim all week. ‘Front crawling through open water, surrounded by the sounds and sights nature, it’s so amazing and it washes away the stresses of the week. It’s nothing like swimming in a pool, it’s both exciting and soothing, brilliant for body and mind. ‘It’s definitely going to get a bit nippier as we go into winter but I’m ready for the challenge!’ So in the spirit of taking the plunge and trying something new, e into a Zinger Popcorn Bucket soon - it is only around for a limited period, available until November .Download the app, head in store or order online.

Ladybridge Preschool, based in Bolton, posted on social media to say it was on the lookout for a new recruit who could transform themselves into a Disney princess and be able to sing out of tune in front of a crowd of tiny humans. Other requirements for the job, which involves looking after children aged two to five, includes having eyes in the back of your head and offering big, warm hugs whenever required. The viral advert reads: You must be comfortable about entering public places on your way home from work with unknown substances on your clothing.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. You must have the ability to read a story book upside down, with at least five interruptions per page. And finally, you must be prepared to engage in lots of fun activities and be prepared to get messy. Your hair and nails will be hard to maintain, but it really is all worth it! Preschool owner Jordan Jackson decided to have fun with the job description and the honest advert appears to have worked perfectly, as she says they have been inundated with hopefuls applying for the role. The -year-old said: I was surprised by the reaction online. We have been inundated with applications which is great.  The way weaposve put it out has inspired people. Itaposs inspired people to apply and Iaposd loveother nurseries would advertise in the same way. I hope it inspires them. Weaposve had so many applicants and itaposs worked. She added: I was hoping to attract someone kind-hearted with a sense of humour. You have to have that. Our staff are all like this. Theyaposre energetic, bubbly, very outgoing. We try and make the setting a home-from-home - as happy as we can. [The post] shows them through the childaposs eyes and what they see. Weaposre extremely child-led. Jordan said the childrenaposs favourite activity is finding mini beasts hidden in shaving foam, and they also have a mud kitchen and an annual paint day, meaning both pupils and staff can get really messy. The owner took inspiration for the job advert from a similar listing written by Moorland Day Nursery in Bolton, and itaposs gone down a storm online. One person replied to say: This is the best job advert ever, and a second wrote: Perfect! I wish more places made job descriptions like this. And another added: Congratulations to whoever wrote this advert - itaposs fabulous.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Police chiefs said plain clothes officers were likely to be deployed in nightclubs although womensapos groups warned some women struggled to trust forces in the wake of Sarah Everardaposs murderer.Home Secretary Priti Patel has requested an urgent update from police following harrowing reports of women being injected at nightclubs across the country.Universities have said they are working with bars and police to help ensure studentsapos safety after the reports.Have you been affected by this story  Get in touch at webnews@mirror Campaigners call for changes to make night venues safer Groups from more than  universities around the UK have joined an online campaign calling for the boycott of nightclubs. Campaigners say they are seeking tangible changes to make night-time venues safer, such as covers stoppers for drinks, better training for staff and more rigorous searches of clubbers. A petition to make it a legal requirement for nightclubs to thoroughly search guests on entry, started last week, has already gained more than , signatures. The National Union of Students issue statement Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students , said: Itaposs absolutely disgusting that in the past few days a number of students have reported instances of women being spiked on nights out. My rage, love and solidarity goes out to all those who have been impacted by these violent acts, and all other women and marginalised folks who experience sexual violence on our campuses and in our communities. One studentaposs story A student has told how she believes she was spiked with an injection during a night out with friends as police say reports of spiking are on the rise.Zara Owen, , from Surrey, who is a student at the University of Nottingham, said she went for a night out with friends last Monday but then blacked out soon after arriving at a venue.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: I went out with my friends to a nightclub in the city - nothing more than what we would usually do. I remember going to the bar, going to the toilet, going to the photobooth, and then after that moment my memory is a blank until I get home and Iaposm getting my phone charger. I know I didnapost drink as much as I usually would on a night out this night, and the fact that I donapost remember anything is terrying for me because this is something that is a very rare occasion to me.  Iaposve never suffered with memory loss and then the next morning, obviously I did with the memory loss, I woke up with a really painful leg. I found a pin prick in my leg which was the epicentre of all pain. It made me unable to walk and I was limping around. As a young person whoaposs at university, Iaposm hearing stories of people who have been to nightclubs and they have been injected. I have heard stories of someone having it through their hand or through their back so this kind of gave me an idea this had happened to me. Ms Owen added she was afraid that she may have contracted a diseasea dirty needle had been used. What did the university say  A University of Nottingham spokesperson said: We are extremely concerned by these reports - no-one should feel unsafe on a night out. We are working closely with Nottinghamshire Police and the cityaposs nightle venues to monitor, review and learn from incidents and experiences in the city centre. We have contacted them about the specic concerns raised and will continue to liaise with them to actively tackle societal problems and challenge behaviours.The NHS website provides some guidelines on what to doyour skin has been punctured with a used needle. They advise to aposwash the wound using running water and plenty of soapapos, aposdry the wound and cover it with a waterproof plaster or dressingapos and to not scrub the wound or suck any blood. Nottingham Policeaposs websites has some guidance on what to doyour drink has been spiked, but they currently do not have any guidelines on being injected. They advise to: Tell the people you’re with and make sure you’re someone where you feel safe. Alert a member of staff at the pub or club you are at. If you feel unwell you should seek medical attention immediately and tell them that you believe your drink has been spiked.Police in Nottinghamshire investigateNottinghamshire Police has seen a rising number of reports of spiking over recent months and are now stepping up operations to tackle the problem. Superintendent Kathryn Craner said: Over the last few months we have seen an increase in reports where people believe that drugs may have been put in their drink - thataposs due to the fact that they have experienced a distinctly dferent feeling to their normal reaction to alcohol. But weaposve also received a small number of reports where people are telling us, as Zara has, that this has been associated with a pain or a mark on a part of their body, scratching sensation, and as though they have been physically spiked. The force has arrested a man as part of the wider operation to tackle spiking in Nottingham. Police Scotland also investigate reports Police are investigating reports of people being spiked by injection in the Edinburgh, Dundee, Glasgow and Aberdeen areas. It follows reports on social media about people being targeted inside venues in Scotland. Police Scotland said a small number of reports from the four areas are being investigated but do not appear to be linked. The force has also received a report of a drink-spiking incident at a venue in the Stirling area and inquiries are ongoing. A Police Scotland spokesman said: We are aware of posts circulating on social media about spiking incidents involving injections in Scotland. Officers are carrying out inquiries, and a small number of reports from the Edinburgh, Dundee, Glasgow and Aberdeen areas are being investigated. These do not appear to be linked. We take all reports seriously and we would encourage anyone who believes they have been a victim of spiking in any form to contact police via .  What politicians are saying about the issue“ These are obviously vile crimes,” said Commons Home Affairs Select Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper.Ms Cooper, a former Shadow Home Secretary, said she received a report today from a victim who attended a hospital casualty unit last night “as a result of a possible injection spiking”. The victim “referred to there being three other people who were in the AE at the same time for spiking more widely, who were unable to walk as a result of drink spiking”.Home Secretary Priti Patel has requested an urgent update from police following harrowing reports of women being injected at nightclubs across the country.A Home Office source said: Weaposve asked the police to look into whataposs going on. We need to understand the scale of the problem. The thought of whataposs going on is just horrendous. What are the experts saying about it Some experts have cast doubt the use of needle spiking being a widespread phenomenon due to multiple iables such as the size of needle needed, the amount of liquid to cause an effect as well as the medical know-how needed to perform the injection.Guy Jones, senior scientist at drugs charity the Loop, told VICE World News: “GHB would be a poor candidate for injection due to the large amount of fluid needed, and therefore the thick, painful needle. This means that the substance involved would be something that would be highly detectable for several days in a toxicology screening such as a benzodiazepine.”David Caldicott, an emergency medicine consultant and founder of drug testing project WEDINOS, also said: “There are a couple of things that are disconcerting about this story. The technical and medical knowledge required to perform this would make this deeply improbable. It is at the level of a state-sponsored actor incapacitating a dissident, like the Novichok incident. The idea that a clubber would do this to a fellow clubber seems highly unlikely to me.

Crews had been called terried by the figure, thinking someone was hanging.When he let the -strong crew in they told him they were investigating reports of a concern for welfare.  Have you got a story youaposd like us to cover  Get in touch at webnews@mirrorThe man who has asked not to be named says: I was asleep in bed when I got a call from concierge to say the police were on their way up. I jumped out of bed in a scare I just totally panicked, I didnapost know what was going on, my kids were in the other room I had to check they were okay. I had police, paramedics, officers all come in. I switched on the lights and within minutes they realised it was the Iron Man sculpture and they just said aposwowapos and aposthataposs coolapos. The next thing they were taking selfies with it. It seems surreal now, but at the time it was really scary.  The man has lived in the flat for a year and said the sculpture has never caused any problems before now. Police officers told the man he should now move the sculpture as aposthe same thing could happen againapos, but he says itaposs simply too heavy. In a video from the scene, a police officer is heard saying: You need to move it, weaposll just keep getting calls. The homeowner is a fan of the Iron Man movies starring Robert Downey Jr, and bought the mammoth £, sculpture just before lockdown which features flashing eyes, chest and hands.  He says: Iaposve been here a year and no one has ever complained about the statue before. I mean we are really high up here. The officers were saying: you need to move Iron Manapos but itaposs just too heavy to do that. It was custom built and touches the ceiling. I just really like Iron Man and this lights up and everything, itaposs cool, I wanted it as a feature for the apartment. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: At around pm last night , police were called to reports of a concern for welfare on Deansgate, Manchester. Emergency services attended and established that there was no cause for concern. West Tower is one of the four huge new apartment blocks that has been built at the far end of Deansgate in the city centre as part of the Deansgate Square cluster. It boasts apartments spread across  floors, while the neighbouring South Tower is the largest of the four towers rising to  floors.

South Kensington’s famous  Thurloe Square, aka The Thin House, became available for £, earlier this year. The architectural oddity, which is just ft at its narrowest point, is a two bedroom, two bathroom home set in historic former artist studios. Images from Rightmove show the flat is kitted out with a modern kitchen and filled with natural light. It has an open plan living area, which is .m long by .m wide, and a very long, but very thin, terrace.  While the staged photos of the flat make it look very liveable, there are a couple of potential reasons why no one has snapped up the basement flat in the  months itaposs been on the market.Likely the main reason is also the explanation for the house’s thinness, My London reports. Unlike other houses on the street, The Thin House is almost directly conjoined with the tube line that runs along the back of the property.  This could also go to explain why buyers might not be keen to pay nearly  grand for a flat that is disturbed by the noise and vibrations of a busy tube line. The house was built in such a way that it almost feels like an optical illusion, with its unusual wedge shape design making the whole house look rather bizarre. Rightmove describes the flat on its website as: “A beautul  bedroom,  bathroom home in fantastic decorative order in historic former artist studios.  “Located on one of the best Garden Squares in Kensington and Cha with direct access to a South facing Patio   Terrace as well as access to the beautul and dog-friendly Thurloe Square Gardens,” the description continues. The flat is situated in one of Londonaposs most affluent neighbourhoods, with good transport links to the rest of the city. With the London property market once again ramping up after a lockdown lull it will be interesting to see who,anyone, snaps up this architectural anomaly.

Four people were rescued from the roof of their submerged car in the village of St Kew on Wednesday evening. Firemen in dry suits used ropes to rescue the occupants who were sitting on the roof of the stranded car in four feet of floodwater. Weather experts were checking out reports of a tornado in Falmouth, West Cornwall.Meanwhile, Devon County Councilaposs emergency centre said highways teams responded to  call-outs overnight as flooding hit parts of the region.Vehicles were stranded on bridges at Axminster in East Devon and there wereflood warnings on the rivers Clyst, Culm, Otter and Uplyme.Torrents of rainwater also flooded through village centres in east Devon causingdisruption.Locals in Widnes, Cheshire, posted videos of the damage created by the tornado, with collapsed garden walls, bins and roof tiles strewn across the middle of the road yesterday. During the night, the tornado was also seen ripping up trees and tearing down fences. The mini-tornado took place with reports of debris in and around Camberwell Park Road.  Local David Nevitt, who filmed some of the footage, said: I personally feel really lucky, my family and house are okay. Thereaposs an area nearby which has been hit really badly, they will be devastated by the damage. We very rarely get bad weather. One video shows debris strewn across the road, with tables and chairs having gone flying, and a fence - including its brick posts - thrown in the air and then dashed back down again.  A tree was also uprooted and could be seen across the road, while another video shows a large tree in someoneaposs front garden ripped out of the ground. A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground.A forecaster at the Met Office said it was entirely possible that a tornado had caused the damage. He said: The weather set-up in the area means that a tornado was possible around midday today in Widnes, although without clear footage of the event itaposs dficult to confirm whether the damaging winds were from a tornado or not. The Met Office had a thunderstorm warning in place in the area throughout the morning, and further unsettled weather was forecast for the afternoon, although itaposs impossible to forecast specic tornado events with any degree of confidence. Tornadoes are not uncommon in the UK and we get, on average, around  per year, though numbers can y markedly from year to year. Tornado reports in the UK tend to be mainly in summer and autumn. Tornadoes in the UK are usually relatively narrow and short-lived affairs, typically lasting for only a few minutes and with tracks no more than a few kilometres long and a diameter of less than - metres.

Betty finally decided she was brave enough to approach a handler offering a tasty treat on the st day of her stay at DogsRescue in Worsley. Bettyaposs transformation was slow but incredible, and the sweet moment was captured on video, the Manchester Evening News reports.The shelter wrote in a video caption: “Betty taking a treat from our hands. This moment has been  days in the making. “Probably the most broken rehab dog we have taken, her transformation whilst slow is incredible.  Moments like this are golden. We are so proud of you Betty.” Later that day they shared the full video, and said: “Betty taking a treat. She’s sat and watched other dogs do this thousands of times. Love, kindness, time and patience pay off in the end. “This was on her st day at our rescue. All in your own time, beautul girl. There’s no clock ticking on how long you can stay here.” In the video, the handler stays calm and still, offering out the treat while Betty is seen looking around tentatively, starting to approach several times, before doubling back, taking a few steps backwards, and then starting again. She then seemingly surveys the area to make sure that the coast is clear before walking up steadily towards the handler, finally taking the treat very gently before beating a hasty retreat. The tweet has gained more than , likes and nearly  comments, with users praising the rescue for allowing Betty to overcome her fears at her own pace. DogsRescue was founded by Emma in  with the aim to rehabilitate dogs across Europe and the UK to homes in the Manchester area. They pride themselves on being a kennel free environment, and believe in ‘pack rehabilitation’, allowing the dogs to enjoy a lestyle where they can exercise and socialise with the other animals, gaining confidence from each other, before eventually being rehomed.  One user said: “That is so beautul to see but I can’t help thinking what the beautul baby has been through to be so frightened. “Thank you so much for your patience and perseverance. You guys are truly amazing.” Another commented: “Bless her, so thankful to you for giving her the opportunity to express herself at her own pace without the time pressure of finding a home. “Thank you for the wonderful work you do.” A third said: “Breaks my heart to see her check her escape route first. Thank goodness she has you guys.”In a further post on Twitter, the rescue said: “Betty is a smart, sweet dog who was unbelievably afraid. It was unthinkable to us to end the le of a healthy dog just because they need time and patience.“It’s a privilege to be on this confidence building journey with her and watch her blossom into a happy member of our pack.” Comment MORE ON FitnessAnimalsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But by sticking to a tight budget and doing the work herself, the -year-lod was able to spend just £. To complete the remarkable transformation, Clare shopped around for deals on paint and even used spray paint for the first time to decorate the  around the bath. Clare managed to complete the transformation in just three days while working in AE and also looking after her children. She was able to spend an hour or two at a time working on the renovation, and eventually finished around three days after beginning.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. After posting the video of her transformation to TikTok, Clare received over , views in one day, with thousands of people praising her renovation skills. I left home at sixteen and moved into a flat and started trying to do it up. I gave things a go I was wallpapering and painting kitchen cupboards back then, said Clare. Iaposm quite arty and Iaposve always had an interest in trying to make things look nice and doing it on a budget most of the time. I didnapost want to change the bathroom suite, because it was in perfectly good condition, but it looked dated, and I wanted to make it look nicer. I painted all the wooden items with black paint that I had leftover and just bought some more in a spray can. It was an experiment I spray painted the bath , the pedestal, and a little bit of the toilet. It looks much better now compared to before. Itaposs not everybodyaposs taste, but itaposs certainly prettier and more interesting now. Clare hopes to inspire other women to pick up the tools and give DIY a shot, sharing her videos on her YouTube channel, Blondy Builder, to give handy tips, tricks and tutorials, and says, whataposs the worst that can happen   A lot of the things on my page, Iaposve picked up from people who were giving it away for free, said Clare. I love to give things a second le by upcycling them. Last year, when I was doing up houses, I made a radiator cover from the wood from a door frame that was going to go in the bin itaposs about being clever with what you have. You also need to shop around for a good deal look for the best places to buy your paint and materials.  The most important things are planning and being creative. I think a lot of it is confidence as well. A lot of the stuff I do is to try and encourage people to give things a go. Iaposm a single female, and I think a lot of women donapost feel confident enough to do a bit of DIY. And Clare isnapost stopping here, as she revealed sheaposs currently renovating another flat.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The comet only passes earth every  or  years, but luckily itaposs possible to see the debris in the form of shooting stars every October.Luckily, the  Orionid meteor shower will be visible across the whole globe – including the UK. According to the Royal Museums Greenwich , the Orionids is one of the best known and most reliable meteor showers in the annual calendar. Andy McCrea, from the Irish Astronomical Association, also says that this particular meteor shower is extra special due to the sheer speed and brightness of the shooting stars.  Here is everything you need to know about spotting them tonight in the UK. What is the Orionid meteor shower  The Orionid meteor shower occurs every year sometime between October  to November . At its peak, up to  meteors are visible every hour. The Orionids receives it name because the meteors seem to emerge, or radiate, from the same are as the constellation. According to RMG, some people also view this particular meteor shower as extra special because the meteors are pieces of the famous Comet P Halley, or Halleyaposs Comet.  This famous comet only swings by earth every  to  years, which means those who may never see the one-in-a-letime event will get some compensation. What time will the Orionids peak in the UK  The Orionids are usually active between October  and November , but this year the peak falls tonight, on October .Luckily, the meteor shower can be seen across both the northern and southern hempishere, so it will be clearly visible from the UK – weather permitting.  In the UK it will peak between midnight tonightand dawn , which falls at .am BST. How to best spot meteors Luckily, you can spot meteors with the naked eye, so yo donapost need any special equipment. According to RMG, youaposll want to find a safe location away from street lights and other sources of light pollution. It continues: The meteors can be seen in all parts of the sky, so it’s good to be in a wide open space where you can scan the night sky with your eyes. Butyou trace the paths that the meteors take, they seem to originate from the constellation of Orion. Itaposs also a good idea to give your eyes a chance to adjust to the dark. Space recommends heading out  minutes earlier than planned to give your eyes a chance to adapt.

James Naughtie, , was spotted by Gordon Duncan downing a “large Chardonnay” at Bennet’s bar, in the Edinburgh suburb of Morningside in Scotland, before leaving to drive home. Gordon, who was previously a regular at the bar, was shocked when he noticed the presenter getting into his car, and reported the series of events to police. Gordon hasn’t felt comfortable going back to the pub he spent  years as a regular since the incident, he said.Speaking to Edinburgh Live, Gordon spoke of how he witnessed Naughtie “gulp down” the big glass of wine while chatting away to someone in the bar.“On this I decided to go outside and pretend I was on a call in the Bennets garden,” he said.  “The guy came out  minutes later and got into his new car and drove off. I took a picture of his car and noted the number plate too. “I then called police immediately.” Gordon explained that he doesn’t believe in drink drivers”. “Itaposs disgusting in this day and age where we have one of the best public services. People who drink drive should be sent to prison,” he said. “I was never afraid to report him, I hate drink drivers I would report him again or someone doing same thing.  Naughtie, , was spotted getting into his car after he had stopped off for a glass of wine at Bennets Bar in Morningside, Edinburgh. The award-winning journalist was traced to his nearby capital home by police officers and admitted he had been driving his vehicle that afternoon in October . He was asked was to provide a roadside breath test and was found to have mg of alcohol in ml of breath. The legal limit is just mg of alcohol. The retired Radio  news anchor appeared in the dock at Edinburgh Sherf Court under his full name of Alexander James Naughtie in June where he pleaded guilty to driving while over the limit. Prosecutor Ross Price said: “Around pm in the afternoon the accused left Bennet’s Bar and a member of staff saw him getting into his vehicle and called police. “Officers made enquiries and attended at the accused’s home address at .pm and breathalysed him. “He confirmed he was the driver [of the vehicle] that afternoon.” Solicitor Sean Flanagan, defending, said his client had been driving to his Edinburgh home and decided to stop off at the public house “for one glass of wine”. The lawyer added Naughtie, whose address was given as Blackthorn Avenue, London, had only driven “a relatively short distance” from the bar to his home and had cooperated fully with police. Sherf Peter McCormack fined the motorist a total of £ and banned him from driving for  months. The sherf said Naughtie would be allowed to take part in a drink drive rehabilitation schemehe chooses which,passed successfully, would see his road ban reduced by three months. Naughtie pleaded guilty to driving a vehicle with mg of alcohol in ml of breath at Maxwell Street, Morningside Road and Cluny Gardens, all Edinburgh, on October , .

Her Majesty, , was forced to cancel her two-day trip to Northern Ireland after being advised take some time out of her schedule. She pulled out of the trip just five hours before she was due to arrive. Buckingham Palace said in a statement: “The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days. “Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements today and tomorrow. “The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland, and looks forward to visiting in the future.” The Northern Ireland trip was cancelled so last minute palace staff were already waiting in Belfast, the Mail Online reports.  A royal source said of the Queen: With her Platinum Jubilee on the horizon, many are thinking that perhaps her private office needs to look at the diary again. Another source added: No one is saying that she should take a step back, but perhaps another slight step to one side might be in order.  It has been confirmed that the monarch is not sick due to Covid-, and that she simply needed to rest after a busy schedule and weeks of travelling. This week the Queen welcomed guests following Boris Johnsonaposs investment summit. She met with business leaders, tech entrepreneurs and politicians, including the the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.

Over the weekend, she had attended the Ascot races and on Monday met with new governor-general of New Zealand virtually.Also last week, the Queen had attended a service at Westminster Abbey for the Royal British Legion, where she was spotted with a walking stick for the first time. The Palace has insisted that there is nothing to be concerned about and that her doctor instructed her to rest.  The Northern Ireland trip would have seen the Queen attend a service marking the centenary of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland. She was also due to visit Hillsborough Castle, which was renamed to the Royal Hillsborough Castle, and would have met with some pandemic heroes. This is not the first time the Queen has been forced to cancel a trip. In January of last year, she was due to visit the Womenaposs Institutebranch in Sandringham, Norfolk but did not attend due to ill health. She was also forced to cancel her appearance at an event at St Pauls in London in June  because she was feeling ill.

If we can keep transmission rates down, we can also keep more pupils in school as well while the vaccine is being run out for  to -year-olds. He added that there was the risk the virus could spread through school children to the older population, their parents and grandparents.  Mr Keeble added: We have started to see that.

Meghan addressed the letter to Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, acknowledging she is not an elected official or politician, but wanted to speak as a mom on the issue.She also wrote about the sacrices working parents have to make not just in pursuit of the American Dream, but simply the dream of stability. Here we look at some of the things weaposve learnt about Meghan from her emotional letter... Meghan enjoyed eating out for . as a child  In a bid to highlight her point about why paid leave is important for parents, Meghan drew on her own experiences as a child. And she recalled how going to eat out would be a special occasion as she could only do it thanks to her parentsapos hard work. She wrote: I grew up on the .salad bar at Sizzler - it may have cost less back then- but what I do remember was the feeling: I knew how hard my parents worked to afford this because even at five bucks, eating out was something special, and I felt lucky. And as a Girl Scout, when my troop would go for dinner for a big celebration, it was back to that same salad bar or The Old Spaghetti Factory - because thataposs what those families could afford to do too.

I waited tables, babysat and piecemealed jobs together to cover odds and ends. I worked all my le and saved where I could - but even that was a luxury - because it was usually about making ends meet and having enough to pay my rent or put gas in my car. She and Prince Harry were aposoverwhelmedapos after Lilibetaposs birthMeghan and husband Prince Harry are parents to two children - two-year-old Archie and four-month-old Lilibet.And according to Meghan both she and Harry were overwhelmed following Lilibetaposs arrival. She said in the letter: In June, my husband and I welcomed our second child. Like any parents, we were overjoyed. Like many parents, we were overwhelmed. Meghan didnapost have to worry about going back to work after Lilibet arrived Meghan points out that she and Harry were among the lucky minority that they werenapost faced with having toto work soon after Lilibetaposs birth. She revealed: Like fewer parents, we werenapost confronted with the harsh reality of either spending those first few critical months with our baby or going back to work. We knew we could take her home, and in that vitalstage, devote any and everything to our kids and to our family. We knew that by doing so we wouldnapost have to make impossible choices about childcare, work and medical care that so many have to make every single day. No family should be faced with these decisions. No family should have to chose between earning a living and having the freedom to take care of their child . Meghan believes paid leave should be a right  In a direct plea, Meghan calls for paid leave to be a national right for every American. She argues: Paid leave should be a national right, rather than a patchwork option limited to those whose employers have policies in place, or those who live in one of the few states where a leave program exists. If weaposre going to create a new era of family-first policies, letaposs make sure that includes a strong paid leave program for every American thataposs guaranteed, accessible, and encouraged without stigma or penalty.

She revealed: I know how politically charged things can – and have – become. But this isnapost about right or left, itaposs about right or wrong. This is about putting families above politics. And for a refreshing change, itaposs something we all seem to agree on. At a point when everything feels so isive, let this be a shared goal that unites us.

A man has been arrestedEllie SImpson, whose sister was targeted in a Nottingham nightclubByCallum Parke:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct A man has been arrested days after a young woman was allegedly injected with a needle in a nightclub. The victim was rushed to AE and spent the night in hospital after the terrying incident, which allegedly happened last Tuesday in Nottingham. Ellie Simpson, the womanaposs sister, said her sibling was with friends in Stealth nightclub when she felt a pinching or scratching sensation on the back of her arm. She began to feel ill, and was taken to AE, where she spent the night on a drip.Ellie told Derbyshire Live that her sister, who studies in Nottingham but is from Derby, has been left seriously shaken by the experience. She said: Sheaposs OK now, but sheaposs still really shaken up and afraid to go out. She went out for a night out and had only had a couple of drinks, so had drank less than she would normally. They were trying to leave the club and on the way out she felt something on the back of her arm, a pinching or scratching sensation, and she canapost remember anything after that. The police took urine samples so I donapost knowthey will be able to find anything. I felt sick, because you see these things happen to other people. You never expect to have it happen to anybody that you know. And then I obviously felt angry, and you just question why, why does somebody want to do that  What were their intentions  Iaposm just thankful she was with a friend becauseshe wasnapost, what would have happened  Spiking is the act of adding alcohol or a drug to food or drink without the knowledge of the person who consumes it. Reports of spikings have been re across the country in recent weeks, with particular concern about the use of needles given the risk of infection with HIV.It is recommended by the NHS that anyone concerned about contracting HIV should use soap to clean the wound, and buy anti-HIV medication within  hours of the incident.Signs that a drink may have been tampered with include a foggy appearance, excessive bubbles, sinking ice or a change in colour. If someone has been spiked, it is recommended to tell a member of staff and to ensure someone stays with the victim, calling an ambulancetheir condition deteriorates. It is important to ensure they do not travel on their own, or drink more alcohol. But Ellie, who has herself been spiked while studying in Loughborough, says women can only do so much to protect themselves and that more should be done to create a safe environment for everyone. She said: Ever since that [Ellie being spiked], my sister has been a lot more conscious in terms of putting your hands over your drink. But when itaposs a needle, how do you stop that  You canapost. Unless you go out in a suit of armour, which weaposre not going to do. Evenyou do search people, itaposs like looking for a needle in a haystack. I personally I donapost know how youaposd go about stopping it, as metal detectors may not pick needles up as theyaposre so small. As women, we shouldnapost have to go out on a night out, thinking have I got my bag, have I got my keys, then thinking, am I safe to go out, am I going to get spiked tonight  It shouldnapost be like that. Boycotts of nightclubs across the country have been organised over the next fortnight in protest. Using the name aposGirls Nights Inapos, events are happening in Derby and Nottingham on Wednesday, October , to coincide with Wednesday nights often being busy student nights, with similar happening across the country into early November. But Ellie has said that anyone, including men, are welcome and encouraged to become part of the campaign for greater awareness and protection in clubs. To other men it must seem like we are blaming them, even though we know it is not all men. I suppose in a club environment, the only sort of way I would feel safe isyou could see a manaposs hands and know where they are, but how you do that  And you shouldnapost have to do that. But weaposre keen to say itaposs not all men. Nottinghamshire police have said that a -year-old man has been arrested after receiving reports of a number of incidents in recent days. He has since been released on bail. He was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A and class B drugs and cause to administer poison or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve and annoy following an incident in Lower Parliament Street on October , four days after Ellieaposs sister was spiked.A petition for greater security checks for nightclubs has also reached over , signatures, surpassing the threshold needed for the matter to be debated in Parliament.

The “super pod”, comprising an estimated  dolphins, can be seen stretching off into the distance, leaping out of the water as they race a whale-watching boat. The amazing scene was captured by the crew of the Catallac, the vessel travelling alongside the dolphins, while it toured the coast off Newport Beach, Calornia, USA. Super pods, which can number more than , dolphins, form where food is plentul, but usually gather in deep water and are far rarer in shallower seas. Jessica Roame, education manager at Newport Landing Whale Watching, which operates the Catallac, said the dolphins may also have been fleeing an unseen predator. “Porpoising out of the water at a high rate of speed is the fastest mode of travel for dolphins because there is less resistance in the air than in water,” she said.  “That’s why these dolphins move in this way when theyaposre in a hurry, and when hundreds of dolphins do this together, we call this a stampede.” Jessica said it was not known exactly what causes dolphins to stampede, but it was thought they could have been evading a predator or catching up to a food source. Jessica estimated that there were some  inidual dolphins stampeding in the video. A typical pod contains anything from two to . “Every time you see a dolphin on the surface, there are normally three or four dolphins underneath the surface,” she said. “They could be related family members in their pod, or multiple pods of common dolphins coming together, and likely this is because of food.”  Patrick Webster of Monterey Bay Aquarium, approximately  miles to the north, said a super pod sighting was one of the ocean’s “magical moments”. “It is fairly rare to see them this close to shore and so readily observable by people,” he said, following a sighting in . Itaposs a very special sighting nearshore of one of the oceanaposs magical moments often hidden away from human observation. “But to the dolphins, it was probably just another Monday.” Newport Landing Whale Watching runs daily whale and wildle watching tours of the Southern Calornia coast all year round.

But a new behind-the-scenes video of where our ice in restaurant drinks comes from might us think twice next time we order a coke. An ice technician who inspects large-scale ice machines for a living has warned customers to opt out of having ice in their drink - because it could make them ill.The TikToker @Jantheman____, who goes by the name aposThe Ice Manapos, posted a video on the  in which he filmed his inspection of the ice machine at a restaurant.

The grimy-looking machine has yellow-stained mould growing around the hinges. The Ice Man says: Let me tell you something real quick – a lot of times people go to restaurants, they get sick and they think itaposs food poisoning or the food made them sick.  Let me tell you this, thereaposs a chance that itaposs the ice that got you sick. When he opens the machineaposs water container, it reveals a scum floating on the top. Then he explains itaposs that water that makes the ice. You canapost tell me that this water hasnapost given people the runs, he says. The Ice Man refers viewers to articles explaining that commercial ice is dirty so they can make an informed decision. While there are plenty of harmful germs that canapost survive on ice, many nasty forms of bacteria can still grow easily in cold conditions.

The one-bed property, located in the heart of Edinburghaposs Grassmarket area, was previously used as a short-term holiday let for the millions of visitors who flock to Victoria Street every year – which is said to have inspired J.K. Rowling’s Diagon Alley. Located just minutes from Edinburgh’s top attractions, the flat is prime Potter real estate, neighbouring several of the cafés where the author wrote early chapters of the book franchise. Owners will also have Edinburgh Castle on their doorstep, which is claimed to have served as inspiration for Hogwarts.

The flat’s front door opens into a hallway that contains secret storage space disguised by a long mirror . The impressive sized living space and modern kitchen-diner boast plenty of natural light and some wallpaper that fans of the franchise will recognise is similar to that of the magical photos which hang in the halls of Hogwarts.  A woodland-themed bedroom, hidden behind a fantastically concealed bookcase door, helps give the feel of being in The Forbidden Forest – though thankfully thereaposs no giant spider named Aragog in sight. A compact bathroom, with a double shower and a rustic copper coin floor, gives the newly-refurbished apartment an eclectic homely feel that any Weasley would be proud of. Other features of the pad include a wizarding chest, references to Gringottaposs Bank, antique books and a Diagon Alley sign.  Despite its bustling location, the propertyaposs newly installed slimline sash and case double glazed windows with handmade shutters are sure to keep the noisy moaning myrtles or dementor-like drafts at bay. While the flat was previously available to rent on Airbnb and was a hit with fans, it is now available to buy.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

This time I ended up getting there at one in the morning...I get there, itaposs one in the morning, I take a shower, the kids are asleep, she said. After I get out of the shower Iaposm looking for ear swabs and Iaposm ready to put my toothbrush in the draw and I opened it and I see the pink toothbrush. I didnapost think much of it but something told me to snoop through the rest of his stuff so I open the bottom and I see all of those girl products. Prior to that visit I had seen he had Cantu shampoo but I didnapost think much of it because of his hair texture, [I thought] thataposs probably what he likes. She continued: But it threw me off when I saw the lotion. I was like I know heaposs not wearing no girl lotion. When she confronted him about what she found, he tried to convince her that it belonged to his friend and that she brought it over one time when she needed to take a shower. As she begins packing her stuff, he tells her not to be stupid because sheaposs just driven nine hours, and insists heaposll sleep on the sofa. But as she sits down to talk with him, she starts noticing suspicious-looking hairs on his carpet. He has a white rug and Iaposm looking at all of the hair, itaposs black but itaposs not curly. And Iaposm thrown off because itaposs long straight hair. I have brown hair but at the time it was black but not % straight so [I knew it wasnapost] my hair, she said. Eventually, he confessed that he had in fact been seeing someone  and she was also three months pregnant. [I said] aposYou didnapost just ask me to move in with you in a whole dferent state and also take my kids but then also in the same conversation seconds later you might be having a baby, how am I supposed to not be mad  she asked. I didnapost know what to do other than walk away. I was almost in shock, dude we had been together almost a year. Heaposd been step-daddy to my kids and all that, we were emotionally attached. The woman later found out he had been cheating on her with more than one woman, all thanks to the use of social media, and this was what pushed her to leave him for good. She added: If he put the toothbrush back I peed and cleaned the toilet with it! We tried to make it work but I couldnapost get over it.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Itaposs even worseyou are brave enough to complain, only for staff to ignore you. One fed-up man decided to go the extra mile after a restaurant didnapost prepare his meal correctly - even though he sent it back four times.Writing on Reddit, the disgruntled customer explained that he had ordered a green Thai curry - and requested that it was at spice level five, which is the hottest.But he said it didnapost seem like the waitress agreed, as she laughed at me, and told me that Iaposm getting it -star, but he reiterated that he wanted his dish to be at max heat. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereWhen she came back with my dish and I tasted it, it was not spicy at all . It wasnapost even a  star. I sent the dish back, and it came back a few moments later with what appeared to be red chile flakes sprinkled on top, he wrote. I asked her about it and was sarcastically told that I ordered it spicy. I told her that it makes no sense to sprinkle red chile flakes on a green curry which is supposed to be made with green chiles . It honestly looked hideous, but I tried it anyway. It still wasnapost spicy, so I sent it back. When I got my dish the third time, it was exactly the same as the first one I got. So I sent it back again, only to have the red chile flakes sprinkled on top again. It was, like that other time, not spicy—so I sent it back for the fourth time.  When I got my dish for the fth time, I was happy to see that there were no red chilli flakes sprinkled on top. The waitress, in a very sarcastic tone, told me that they made it extra spicy just for me, told me that she was going to stand there and watch me eat it, and took away my water glass. I tried it, and it was not extra spicy. But it was just barely acceptable, so I didnapost send it back. I told her so, and she walked away looking completely bewildered as I finished my bland meal. The next day, he reordered the dish to his hotel room, as heaposs visiting the city on a business trip, and used a Thai name while placing the order.  Sure enough, the food was very spicy just as I ordered. It was far better than the extra spicy dish I had at the restaurant, he wrote. I sent the manager an email detailing my experience at the restaurant, along with the waitressaposs rude behaviour. I told them about the dference between my meal from that day and my delivery order. The manager apologised and told me that they will talk to the waitress in question. The post left people in stitches at the manaposs effort, while another restaurant worker explained what the waitress could have done. They wrote: I worked in a Thai restaurant a while and had mountains of idiots asking for  stars while they clearly had no clue what they were doing. We had a whole thing. aposOh, your ordering more than -star sir  Why donapost you try our -star hot sauce first  Itaposs on the house.aposMost customers stuck with - stars after trying the hot sauce. If you donapost want people to order food that spicy that they canapost eat, then give them a way to properly get a grasp on the spice. Another added: I canapost imagine feeling comfortable sending a dish back more than once. Iaposd sooner ask for a refund and leave than have them attempt to make it that many times. And then to order it again to the room  Who would actually do this  A third commented: The waitress didnapost do her job. I worked in a Thai restaurant for some years. I always got asked how spicy medium spicy is, or how spicy extra spicy is. As the waitress, you have to communicate with the guests on what spicy they can handle and find enjoyable to eat. So you can translate that to the chef.

Designer Nicole McLaughlin shared footage where rows of labelled folders were stacked neatly in her fridge, before she opened the apossandwichapos binder where cheese, meats, pickles, salad and slices of bread had been inidually stored in plastic folders. Each item is then taken out to be used to prepare a perfect sandwich, and other binders in the fridge are labelled condiments, drinks, breakfast, fruit, and desserts. But as viewers were left outraged by the system, Nicole pointed out that it was merely a project and in no way reflected her real-le fridge at home. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The video racked up an incredible  million views and Nicole, from New York, US, said: My projects are always about finding fun ways to reuse dferent things for entirely dferent purposes. One night before I was going to sleep, I suddenly had the thought aposwhatthe refrigerator was like a library and it was so organised apos I know some people already organise the food in their fridge into labelled containers so I thought itaposd be funnyI took it to the next level, and have it be super organised by whatever the type of food was. I had a folder with the sandwich ingredients separated out, there was a compartment for the cheese and one for the sandwich meat.  I had done a project with those binder sleeves a couple of months before, so I just had them lying in my house. Nicole filmed her creation while on holiday with her family, taking everything she needed with her, and said they thought she was insane but get what I do at this point. She added: Itaposs always so funny to see how people react. You assume most people will take it as a joke about a crazy scenario where you would organise your fridge in that type of way.  Some commenters took it really seriously, and I think itaposs really funny that happened. I had some people commenting aposthis is some psychotic organisationapos. I donapost take any of the comments to heart. Itaposs funny because Iaposm not really that organised, Iaposm not that way at all. My studio is usually crazy, but itaposs funny to take things to an extreme level to see peopleaposs reactions. I really liked the comments where people said things like aposthis is some serial killer stuffapos, or aposmy organisational skills could neverapos. I hope people got that it was a joke, and this isnapost how I actually live. And many viewers on TikTok didnapost hold back on judging Nicoleaposs project, as one said: I feel like sociopaths do this, like what is this  A second wrote: Gives me serial killer vibes. And another added: Now this is art. I see it as a representation of diet culture and those who calorie count.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

something many of us do regularly, with majority of us not even looking at the ingredients list. But for those with allergies, picking up the wrong sandwich could be the dference between le and death.The introduction of Natasha#s Law earlier this month has now made this simple task much easier due to businesses now having to provide a full list of ingredients and allergens on foods packaged for sale on the premises.The law was first put forward in  following the tragic death of -year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse who, in , suffered a fatal allergic reaction after eating a baguette bought from Pret a Manger which had undeclared sesame seeds in it.And it has taken until now to finally get it introduced.But what does this mean for those with allergies or living with family members who have them Lesley Garden, a food blogger and mum-of-two who lives in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire with her husband, Keith, is all too familiar with food allergies.Her daughter, Anna, , has a peanut allergy and has only in the last year or two grown out of her egg allergy which she has had from birth.Lesley#s mum is also coeliac, so the introduction of this law will dramatically improve her family#s confidence in business# highlighting what ingredients are in readymade on-the-go goods.She said: #Egg is one of those allergies that you can grow out of but it was very severe when she was a baby. We got to the stage with her allergy testing where she was ingesting it and it was quite an emotional day when we found out she could eat egg. The two of us burst out crying. Unless you#re living it, I don#t think you understand the relief of ticking one off the list.#This change in the law is long overdue. It seems ludicrous that you can sell something and not identy what is in it.#For Anna, it gives her more confidence that everything is on the labelling. Allergies should be up front and central, and then the full ingredients should be listed. It helps her make properly informed decisions.#It means she doesn#t have to just have a cheese and ham sandwich because they are safe. She is quite a foodie and the more awareness of it the better.#Anna#s egg allergy was so severe she could struggle to breatheshe ingested it. But while her peanut allergy still remains, Lesley is happy to see Anna gain even more independence when picking up food on-the-go.#This is not a fad. It is le threatening to hershe eats these things. I think having her able to make these decisions for herself, without me, helps her grow up.#All through primary school I had control over what she ate. When they make that step away from you in secondary, there is terror.#You need to give your child independence but when she came to me to ask to go out for lunch at school terried me.Her throat constricts and she starts growling because she can#t breathe.#Lesley Garden#The fact that she can go and check all the labels of everything on sale is really reassuring. You can#t make their le dferent to their friends.#I educate her to check labels, butthe labels aren#t right, where do you go from there #While Anna carries her EpiPen on her at all times, and all of her close friends and family are trained in how to use it, Lesley says she still has concerns around eating out, especially in restaurants and cafes.She has seen the sector adapt over the past  years she has been the parent of a child with allergies, but says more needs to be done when it comes to staff training and understanding the severity of allergies.She added: #Staff training in restaurants needs to be better. Around  years ago I ordered Anna breakfast without eggs as I explained she had an egg allergy. They put it down with eggs on it. Thankfully her allergies aren#t airborne but I couldn#t believe it.#Anna is  now and in all those years I#ve only been asked once by waiting staffshe has her EpiPen with her.#I#ve had to explain, when people were vague, that she could potentially stop breathing. It is terrying seeing it. Her throat constricts and she starts growling because she can#t breathe.#Restaurants are far better now than they ever have been, but things still need to improve. With booking online so good nowadays I#m now able to let the restaurant know on the reservation.#When I was in Wahaca in London they were phenomenal. She got her own menu and a table of ingredients on all of the dishes. It was so easy and took all the fear away. The manager dealt with Anna#s order separately. I#ve never had anything like it.#Apps like LiberEat have also been so helpful and the way technology can be used to help people with allergies be more confident around food is so brilliant.##This law is a huge step in safeguarding those with le threatening allergies. It is le changing.#Thomas Johnstone is . He lives in Aberdeen and is a MSc in Sustainability Transitions student at the university of Aberdeen.He has a nut, peanut and sesame allergy.Due to the introduction of Natasha#s Law Thomas says he can now pick up food quicker and with confidence. However, he is still cautious with cross contamination always being an issue for those with allergies.#I’m most allergicto hazelnuts and slightly allergy to sesame.#I do think the introduction of the new law will help a lot. It does suck having gone into a store and find the products have unclear or no allergen labelling.#For certain places, especially those that prepare the food fresh on the day, there will always be a cross contamination risk and that’s something we need to weigh up inidually.It is a real shame that it took a death for this kind of change to come into force.#Thomas Johnstone.#However I remember when Pret began putting a full ingredients lists on their products and it made things a lot easier for me to check.#It is also a little embarrassing sometimes having to ask a staff member what ingredients are used in their products and then they pull out a huge folder of allergens. It takes away from the grab-and-go aspect.With the law now in place, it is bitter sweet for those with allergies knowing that it took a tragic death for their concerns to be heard and legislation to be put in place.He added: #It is a real shame that it took a death for this kind of change to come into force.

That’s straightforward. I’ve got the final decision on any player that comes into the club.#I can only talk from experience of what I’ve got right now. But I think the chairman also referred to the majority of managers wanting total control over recruitment and a dferent number of departments at the club.#It’s not me who has set up the way the club is now. The club has set it up.“Any manager, coach, whatever you want you want to call it, who was coming in would work under that structure.#It’s almost made out that it’s because of myself and because of the chairman, but the club made a decision to move in a certain direction when they decided to make a change from the previous management team.”In his press conference ahead on Saturday#s all-important clash with Hibs in the Granite City, Glass provided insight into the recruitment work he and his backroom staff have undertook during the summer to reshape the Dons squad.He said: “Until probably a month ago, we didn’t have a head of recruitment. The previous manager left, the head of recruitment left in the summer.“The recruitment was done by myself and the rest of the staff over the summer.#Our analyst took sick right before the first European game. He was off work sick for two months and then handed in his notice.“Every piece of analysis work has been done by myself and the staff. We are pretty short-handed at the minute. But we decided not to put any of that out there, because I don’t look for excuses.“That’s how much handle we’ve got on the club at the moment. I think people saw change of certain positions almost asthe trigger was getting pulled left, right and centre. But some people chose to leave the club.”The Aberdeen manager has been in the spotlight following the club’s dire run of results with a section of supporters calling for his dismissal following Saturday’s - loss to Dundee at Dens Park.The reaction of the fans did not go unnoticed in the Aberdeen dugout.Glass said: “It wasn#t nice but I#m well aware that when you don#t get results. I played at the club long enough and saw managers suffer through it.#I#m the front man in this and, when results are going the way they#re going, I fully understand.#But it#s not everyone. It#s not the majority at the moment and, to me, they are not the people who are going to be proved right.#There#s a group of people who put me in charge of this club and believe in me and the staff I have put together amidst a lot of outside people who want to twist it a certain way.#The fuel that we#ve got is trying to prove people right # not prove people wrong.#The positive influences in my le are the people I#m trying to prove right.

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

He was a morphine addict who destroyed his prospects as a doctor.ldquoHe used to have practices in Rotherfield, where he murdered Hubert, but he had to leave because he was so addicted to morphine.ldquoHe could not handle the practice anymore and moved to Bournemouth and became incapable of running his practice.Dr Bondeson, , is no stranger to writing about gruesome murders.Earlier this year, he told the story of a dozen unsolved murders in London, including that of prostitute Harriet Buswell, who was killed on Christmas Day.It was during the writing of that book, which was reissued this year, that he came across the story of Dr Lamson.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoBack in  or , I wrote a book called Victorian Murders about ious murders in Victorian times.ldquoDr Lamson was one of the cases and I was surprised how much new material could be found about him.ldquoThere had not been a modern study of him in the last  years and it seemed a good idea to remedy that and write a story of Dr Lamson using modern research, as well as files from the National Archives in Kew.Dr Lamson had been a military doctor before taking on the medical practice in Rotherfield, East Sussex.After he married, he gained two brothers-in-law: Hubert, who had tuberculosis, and Percy, who had scoliosis.In , during a family gathering, Hubert died suddenly, with his cause of death listed as pulmonary consumption and amyloid degeneration.Just two years later, Dr Lamson persuaded Percy to swallow a gelatine capsule, with forensic scientists later finding he had been poisoned with the uncommon vegetable toxin aconitine.Dr Lamson was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoDuring his criminous and wasted le, Dr Lamson had accomplished some good but also much wickedness short and evil had been his days, as he stood on the scaffold counting one or two more seconds, the longest-lasting in his le, waiting for the drop to open.ldquoThe police detectives, and even Lamsonrsquos barrister Montagu Williams, felt certain that Dr Lamson was a double murderer, having poisoned both his brothers-in-law for the sake of profit.ldquoComparing his murderous career with those of the prolic medical killers Palmer and Pritchard, it indeed seems likely that Dr Lamson murdered Hubert John as well and got away with it."},{"url":null,"title":"poets-dream-greener-planet-feature-climate-summit-glasgow","story":"The Rev Jock Steinrsquos poem The World I Want will be part of a unique virtual art exhibition ahead of

The vessel design is broadly based on our larger loch class vessels, which are double-ended.“Once the designs are approved, we will move to the next stage of the project, which will see the build of the engine to be used in feasibility studies.“The maritime industry has a key role in the global fight for climate change, and this project marks a step toward emissions-free marine transport.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Robert Leslie, THAW Orkney manager, said:#We are extremely grateful for this funding from Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks. We experienced high demand during the pandemic from Orkney residents with mental health issues or learning dficulties as they sought support to engage with energy efficiency programmes, energy providers, and income maximisation and debt services. It became clear, due to the volume of referrals and complexity of some of the work, that this was an area of our activity that needed to expand or we would be overwhelmed.#This contribution from the Resilient Communities Fund will add resource to this vital work at a time we expect demand to grow considerably again, with rising electricity prices and reductions in other support mechanisms that have been in place during the pandemic.

There was a strong local representation too with young people from schools right across Armagh involved in proceedings. Organised by the Church Leaders Group , the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh, the Presbyterian Moderator, the President of the Methodist Church and President of the Irish Council of Churches all had a hand in the service. A heavy police cordon was in effect in Armagh and around St Patricks Cathedral from the early hours of the morning. Media from across Ireland had descended on the city for the service too, which was televised across the UK on the BBC and across Ireland on RTE. Before the service began, the Assistant Organist, the Revd Canon Dr Peter Thompson, played as guests arrived. The Cathedral bells rang as dignitaries arrived, including the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and the leaders of the DUP, UUP, Alliance and SDLP. The Queen, who was unable to attend, was represented by the Earl of Caledon. The opening hymn of the service O Christ the same through all our storys pages - played to the melody of Londonderry Air - was followed by a reading of scripture by the recently appointed Dean of Armagh, the Very Revd Shane Forster.  He read  Corinthians :-: Soanyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away see, everything has become new! All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. The Dean also welcomed everyone to the service. We gather here today on this ancient hill of Armagh, where St Patrick established a faith community and church over fteen hundred years ago, to reflect on the signicance of this centenary year and the long road we have travelled which also stretches out before us, he said. In this the ecclesiastical capital of this island, a centuries old place of learning and outreach, we meet together at this time, people from erse backgrounds and traditions, with dferent beliefs and aspirations, to pray for the healing of past hurts and to seek God’s guidance and hope for the future.  Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has ided us, and yet it has also on occasion brought us together. As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light filled, prosperous and peaceful future. His following prayer spoke of how we as a people had wounded each other and our communities in the past. We are sorry and ashamed and asked for your forgiveness, so that together we may move forward in faith, grow together in love, and faithfully serve you all our days. Soloist Helena Hendron, accompanied by the gentlemen of the Cathedral Choir, sang The Deers Cry, before a reading from Isiah :- by Rebecca Morris. A song of hope, Were the Future of Tomorrow, was sung by a childrens choir drawn from the local area. That was followed by a reading from St Matthew :- by Oisiacuten Walsh. The hopes, dreams and aspirations of the next generation were then given to the congregation by Lucy Addis from the Royal School, Armagh, Sean McCourt-Kelly from St Patrick’s High School, Keady, and Andrea Andrews, a pupil of La Cheacuteile Secondary School in Tyrrelstown in Dublin. Prayers were read, with the opening prayer read in Irish by Linda Ervine and Seacutean Cull. Intercessions were offered by Professor Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the conflict. Reflections were then given by the Church Leaders, with the exception of the Methodist Leader, who was giving the sermon later. ‘In Christ Alone’, a hymn written by Stuart Townend and Keith Getty, who has links to the Armagh area, was then sung by the congregation. Rev’d Dr Sahr Yambasu, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, then gave his sermon, followed by the Act of Commitment, led by Rosa McCloskey and James Chamberlain, a pupil of Markethill High School. The most symbolic act of the service saw Billy Wilson, a pupil of City of Armagh High School, carry a lantern, representing a light of hope, through the Cathedral where it was received in the santuary by the Church Leaders. Billy was accompanied by Libby Harrison from Saints and Scholars Primary School, Erika Stancuite of Mount St Catherines Primary School and Alfie Cummings who attends Armstrong Primary School. Blessings sung by the Cathedral Choir and given by the Church Leaders, then took place, before the final hymn, ‘Be Thou My Vision’."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4173607.jpg--.jpg?1634813844000\n","title":"student emma wins uk design title","story":" A BALLYMENA Graphic Design student has been announced as the winner of the prestigious ACA UK  Ireland Award.

An advance team is already thought to have been in place in Northern Ireland planning for the visit.Read MoreQueen cancels trip to NI after being advised to rest for ‘next few days’The cancellation is not Covid-related and it is not known what are the health issues that forced her to make this concession, which is likely to mark the start of a more considered period of public appearances after a busy time for the monarch.The spokesperson said the event would go ahead as planned but no other member of the Royal Family would attend in Her Majesty’s place and alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson.The planned event has been fraught with political dficulty after Irish President Michael D Higgins last month declined an invitation from the Church Leaders Group.

They continued: “We hope that tomorrow’s service will provide an opportunity to further that work, with an emphasis on our shared hopes for the future.”The Queen is in good spirits but disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, the palace said. A spokesperson added: The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and looks forward to visiting in the future. The monarch is, however, still expected to attend the COP climate change conference in Glasgow later this month.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: We thank Her Majesty for her good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and trust that she will keep well and benefit from a period of rest.It is always a joy to have Her Majesty in Royal Hillsborough and we look forward to a further visit in the near future.Wishing the Queen well, Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the monarch had been a source of great comfort during Northern Ireland#s darkest days and provided lasting leadership as we moved into a new era for all our people.Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he wished the Queen all the very best as she takes a few days# rest.The Queen, the nation#s longest-reigning monarch, attended a series of events in recent days, hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle, where she is currently resting.It was revealed on Tuesday the monarch had declined the Oldie of the Year award proffered from the magazine of the same name.

Originally from Sierra Leone, he is the first African-born leader of one of Ireland’s main churches.The leaders of Ireland’s main churches delivered their personal reflections on the creation of Northern Ireland at the centenary service in Armagh.Catholic Primate of All Ireland Eamon Martin said: “I reflect as a church leader on the last  years.“I have to face the dficult truth that perhaps we in the churches could have done more to deepen our understanding of each other and to bring healing and peace to our ided and wounded communities.”David Bruce, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said: “I grieve the times when fear has held us back from building relationships with those with whom we dfer.“If we are to build a better future, then we must recognise our own woundedness and our responsibility to care for the wounds of one another.”The Church of Ireland Primate of All Ireland, John McDowell, said: “We obsessed about some things, especially borders. One way or another, we’re obsessing about them again, and being distracted from really thinking about what a good society would look like.“But I am hopeful. Hopeful in a new generation who know that the big problems we’ve landed them with, especially climate change and economic inequality, can only be tackled together.“I think there are already signs that the next generation will see the things that we obsessed about as secondary and place their priorities where.”Read MoreAlf McCreary:OpinionSadly, the absence of the Queen and Michael D Higgins will be remembered long after centenary church service eventHere#s how the service unfolded: []jsdjs.src\"embed.scribblelive widgets embed.js\"ijsMost ReadBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church servicePolice raid Mid and East Antrim council offices, leaving local councillors ‘shocked’‘Tiocfaidh ar la’: Nigel Farage ‘happy to say anything for £’NI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardAlban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top jobTop VideosPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to rest\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary serviceLatest Northern IrelandWest Belfast man who allegedly fractured partner#s ribs then forced her out of his home granted bailCentenary service focuses on past and futureSDLP leader urges those who snubbed centenary service to ‘look at what happened’NI schools struggling to cope with staff shortages sending pupils homeNI centenary church service told building equal and just future on island a ‘moral imperative’LatestWest Belfast man who allegedly fractured partner#s ribs then forced her out of his home granted bailTributes paid to Scot who died ‘rescuing grandsons’ from the sea in CreteMourners gather to remember ‘unassuming’ and ‘most decent’ MPAli Harbi Ali in court charged with terror murder of Sir David AmessRalph Hasenhuttl admits he underestimated ‘long-ball’ Burnley,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is absolutely crucial people support those businesses as that is what the voucher is all about.”Colin Neill from Hospitality Ulster added: “Look, we all have to accept there are people maybe less fortunate than you and I, that this £ puts food in their cupboard.“But I think there is a huge dference between someone going and buying groceries in one of our supermarkets to feed their kids and using it for an Amazon voucher.“I think at this point we should be appealing to them [the supermarkets] and they should come out and make a statement and say they should no longer accept [the card] for that type of purchase.”During the show a number of callers admitted they would be using the Spend Local card to purchase vouchers for the online retail giant.One man called Graham told the show: “When I get my money, I am going to nip down and buy a voucher and I am going to spend it on Amazon.I am going to buy on Amazon something I can get for maybe half the price I can buy through my local retailer.”While the cards cannot be used online or for gambling or legal services like penalties, according to the Department for the Economy there is no technical way to prevent online gt vouchers being purchased in a store.They said the “limits of the technology” mean it is “not possible to distinguish between items within someone’s shopping basket”.In a statement from a department spokesperson, they instead encouraged the public to think of the local retailers who have been impacted by the pandemic and said an advertising campaign is designed to encourage this.“The High Street Scheme is designed to stimulate demand in local businesses, including retail and hospitality sectors, following the pandemic,” they said.“However, the scheme has also been designed to be as simple to use as possible in order to allow the public to spend their £ pre-paid card in local businesses.“It was set up so that businesses in Northern Ireland that can accept a debit or credit card as payment for goods or services they sell, can also accept the Spend Local cards as payment.“While it is possible to purchase some goods which will have less benefit to our local businesses, the Department would discourage this.”They added: “Indeed, the Department has been clear in its messaging to all card holders – use your Spend Local card to help those retail, hospitality and other sectors in your local area that have been most impacted by the pandemic.“This message has been embraced by many of our local business owners who are encouraging card holders to spend a little to give a big effect. We encourage Nolan Show listeners to do the same.”Most ReadBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church servicePolice raid Mid and East Antrim council offices, leaving local councillors ‘shocked’‘Tiocfaidh ar la’: Nigel Farage ‘happy to say anything for £’NI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardAlban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top jobTop VideosPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to rest\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary serviceLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland Protocol problems need to be flushed out quickly, says PMWest Belfast man who allegedly fractured partner#s ribs then forced her out of his home granted bailCentenary service focuses on past and futureSDLP leader urges those who snubbed centenary service to ‘look at what happened’NI schools struggling to cope with staff shortages sending pupils homeLatestPaddy McAllister on why ‘happiness had to come first’ after we’s stroke scare as ex-Ulster Rugby star rejected new Connacht dealJohnson rejects calls to activate Covid Plan BNorthern Ireland Protocol problems need to be flushed out quickly, says PMLeicester need to build on two ‘very big wins’ – Patson DakaGraham Potter hoping for ‘a cuddle’ when Pep Guardiola s to Brighton,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No one wants ato the draconian measures that have been in place for so long.The Executive has identied a robust and dynamic communication strategy as key in achieving this. Time will tellit can stay on message.Most ReadBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church servicePolice raid Mid and East Antrim council offices, leaving local councillors ‘shocked’‘Tiocfaidh ar la’: Nigel Farage ‘happy to say anything for £’NI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardAlban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top jobTop VideosPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to rest\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary serviceLatest Northern IrelandWest Belfast man who allegedly fractured partner#s ribs then forced her out of his home granted bailCentenary service focuses on past and futureSDLP leader urges those who snubbed centenary service to ‘look at what happened’NI schools struggling to cope with staff shortages sending pupils homeNI centenary church service told building equal and just future on island a ‘moral imperative’LatestWales wing Josh Adams excited by prospect of facing New ZealandSir David Amess murder accused ‘began plotting to kill an MP two years ago’Coroner’s praise for student’s parents facing inquest delayWest Belfast man who allegedly fractured partner#s ribs then forced her out of his home granted bailTributes paid to Scot who died ‘rescuing grandsons’ from the sea in Crete,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Martin McKeown.Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, Claudy para-triathletes Chloe and Judith MacCombe have put themselves in pole position for a place in the Northern Ireland team for the Commonwealth Games after claiming first and second place at the national championships in Limerick. Chloe’s gold medal finish and her twin sister Judith’s runner up spot was a reverse of the result at the same competition in Drogheda pre lockdown in . googletag.cmd.push It leaves them in eighth and tenth place respectively in the Commonwealth Games rankings where the top ten will qualy for the games in Birmingham next summer. They have been working daily towards their goal at the Foyle Arena where Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Athlete Support Membership Scheme gives them free access to Council leisure facilities. The -year-olds are former students at Limavady Grammar and were diagnosed at birth with a form of albinism that means their sight is around one third of what someone with   vision would experience. They have barely spent a day apart in those  years and both studied geography at Ulster University in Coleraine during which time a chance meeting with Irish triathlon high performance coach Eamon Tilley guided them towards the gruelling discipline.     “We weren’t overly sporty growing up,” Chloe recalled. “We got involved in rugby and rowing at Coleraine and were talent spotted by the Irish para rowing team and while we were there Eamon Tilley suggested we try the triathlon. “We started going to training days in  and we took part in our first race in , we didn’t perform that well but enjoyed the challenge of pushing ourselves so we did a few more events and started to improve.” The big breakthrough for the girls came in  when Judith claimed first and Chloe second place at the National Paratriathlon Championships at Pulse Port Beach in Drogheda, it looked to be the start of an exciting period but the Covid  pandemic led to an end to all competition in . “It was a big challenge to keep the momentum of our training going during lockdown,” said Judith. “We had been coming to the Foyle Arena  or  times a week so to lose access was a big blow. “We have an intimate knowledge of the back roads of Claudy from all the cycling and running we did while the centre was closed, it has been great to get access back, particularly in the pool which has now been ided up for dferent swimming speeds.” “Limerick was our first major event after lockdown so we weren’t sure how it would go,” Chloe added. “I am stronger on the bike but I knew Judith would make up ground on me on the run so I had to make sure I had a lead. “The membership scheme has had a massive impact on our success, training for a triathlon is very expensive and we don’t get any funding so it has been a real leline. “The facilities at the Foyle Arena are world class and the staff and coaches here have been very accommodating and taken a genuine interest in our journey. “To compete at the Commonwealth Games alongside my sister would be a dream come true and that goal drives us each day to train harder and get faster.” Opportunities The Athlete Support Membership Scheme aims to provide talented local athletes involved in an amateur sport with the best possible opportunities to develop and prepare for competition. Applicants must be currently part of a recognised gover​ning body, talent pathway or be officially representing their sport at county level or higher. Applicants who fulfil the criteria will be entitled to six months free access to gym, health suite and swimming pool facilities, they must be involved in an amateur sport which is recognised by either Sport Northern Ireland or the Irish Sports Council. Sports coordinator at Derry City and Strabane District Council, Keith Thompson, said: “World level athletes need world class facilities to compete at the highest level and we are delighted to be able to support a number of elite athletes at the Foyle Arena through free membership. “The team at the Foyle Arena are delighted for them and we are pleased to have played a role in their success.” To apply for the Athlete Support Membership scheme e mail Keith at keith.thompson@ derrystrabane.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces. Mr Givan set out a range of optionsCovid cases rise drastically or hospital pressures become “unsustainable” with the possibility of deploying Covid vaccine passports in high-risk settings, “ considered appropriate.” The Department of Health at Stormont is also working on a systemthis situation arises that would see the strengthening of self-isolation rules for close contacts of those who contract the virus and a re-imposition in law of social distancing in certain settings.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party   How many familiar faces will you spot today.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party   How many familiar faces will you spot today.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, JUNIOR FINALColeraine v Na Magha -Sunday– OwenbegRef: Niall Clford Sundays junior final is a repeat of the  final when Deaglan Foleys point in an inspired second-half display saw city side Na Magha earn a - to - draw. Colm McGoldrick and Niall Holly scored Eoghan Ruas goals in a game that was sandwiched between their drawn football and their replay win that ended the Emmets hopes of clinching five in a row. googletag.cmd.push After winning the Ulster junior in , the Coleraine club werent allowed to compete in the Ulster series until the following year when they won Ulster again in , so it will be Na Magha who will take on the Cavan champions when the provincial series begins at the end of November, Coleraine were on the wrong end of a thumping by Swatragh in this years qualying round, losing - to - with the Davitts also hitting  wides. Liam McGoldrick, currently working in London, was absent. So too are Aidan Boyle, Niall Holly, Ciaran and Barry McGoldrick, while Ruairi Mooney came on late in the game, one of only two subs.     Na Maghas qualier with Ballinasccreen was a total contrast, as they gave Screen the scare of their lives, despite missing top scorer from the league, Tim Rankin. Cathal McDaids side were - to - up at half-time, but had no answer to a resurgent Na Magha side in the third quarter.Michael Lynch and Tomaacutes Lally ran riot from deep, with Deaglan Foley beginning to find his range. It wasnt until the second water break that the momentum began to change. If Na Magha are to launch an assault on the Ulster title, a performance and silverware would be a great start on Sunday.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, JUNIOR FINALColeraine v Na Magha -Sunday– OwenbegRef: Niall Clford Sundays junior final is a repeat of the  final when Deaglan Foleys point in an inspired second-half display saw city side Na Magha earn a - to - draw. Colm McGoldrick and Niall Holly scored Eoghan Ruas goals in a game that was sandwiched between their drawn football and their replay win that ended the Emmets hopes of clinching five in a row. googletag.cmd.push After winning the Ulster junior in , the Coleraine club werent allowed to compete in the Ulster series until the following year when they won Ulster again in , so it will be Na Magha who will take on the Cavan champions when the provincial series begins at the end of November, Coleraine were on the wrong end of a thumping by Swatragh in this years qualying round, losing - to - with the Davitts also hitting  wides. Liam McGoldrick, currently working in London, was absent. So too are Aidan Boyle, Niall Holly, Ciaran and Barry McGoldrick, while Ruairi Mooney came on late in the game, one of only two subs.     Na Maghas qualier with Ballinasccreen was a total contrast, as they gave Screen the scare of their lives, despite missing top scorer from the league, Tim Rankin. Cathal McDaids side were - to - up at half-time, but had no answer to a resurgent Na Magha side in the third quarter.Michael Lynch and Tomaacutes Lally ran riot from deep, with Deaglan Foley beginning to find his range. It wasnt until the second water break that the momentum began to change. If Na Magha are to launch an assault on the Ulster title, a performance and silverware would be a great start on Sunday.

I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party   How many familiar faces will you spot today.

A listing on the Paul Birt Estate Agents website describes possible uses for the building as a coffee shop, dental practice, creche or office accommodation. A spokesperson from Donaghy Bros confirmed the building was available to rent on a short-term basis. “Its still very much on the agenda to preserve this great building and our plan is to utilise it for additional shop and office space for Donaghy Bros,” they said. “However with a number of other imminent business commitments, we have decided to postpone our plans for the Danske building for another year or so.     “Rather than have the building remain vacant, without proper care and maintenance, we aim to lease it out on a short term basis, should we find a suitable tenant.” The Kilrea-based company are currently undertaking a pound million refurb of their Limavady store, which will commence next week.

When Ann decided four years ago to take on a new challenge in the form of running, she knew Claire would be her biggest supporter. googletag.cmd.push You see, Claire is no stranger to running, having undertaken almost  marathons to date, including ultras and  hour running events, she was only too happy to share her experience with herolder sister. The twins celebrate their achievements. But that Sunday morning Ann would have to step out in The Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon without Claire by her side.. and it seems Claire was more nervous than Ann about that. Ann, who lives inMagherasaid: “I only started running in  when we lost our youngest sister, Julie. I was , about to turn  later that year. Swatragh playgroup ran a CK and I joined in with that, that led on to me wanting to run more.     “Claire has been the biggest inspiration, she was always giving me words of advice, evenshe didnt realise she was doing it.” So as Ann built up her miles, and their thbirthday approached, the twins planned a trip to celebrate. But this wouldnt be a holiday where they needed flip-flops, the pair of them packed their running shoes and Ann ran her very first half marathon on the morning of their birthday, in sunny Benidorm with proud twin sister Claire by her side. Claire pictured in London. Claire, who is a member of Ballymena Runners said: “We have done lots of firsts together. Anns first k was with me in Ballymena and we did the half marathon at .am on the morning of our birthday – that was an unofficial one, but I was also there when Ann undertook her first official one. That was in Derry, I was her pacer and she was the only person in the group to stay with me the entire way. “I will never forget it, over the Foyle bridge Ann was right on my heels, I was immensely proud that day.” So how come on Sunday, October  the sisters ended up running in dferent places  Claire, a Learning Support Assistant at St Patricks College Ballymena, explained: “I had every intention of running Belfast, I wanted to be there for Anns very first marathon, but I had got through to run London in  and a stress fracture ruled me out, so when I had the chance this time I was so happy to do it, and it honestly didnt disappoint.” Ann, who works in Crawfords in Maghera, said: “At the beginning I had little motivation running solo, so I started doing social runs with other people close to home, as well as track training. I train with Rosemary Hargan but I belong to Termoneeny running Club.” And when Ann decided she was entering the Belfast Marathon, Claire was only too happy to be her training partner. Ann said: “Claire did a good few training runs with me, she gave me lots of advice, but above all was to smile and enjoy every step which is exactly what I did. I wasnt nervous until I saw the starting line, then I got a message from Claire and knew she was thinking of me, it really relaxed me knowing she was rooting for me! With my phone in my pocket, it was like she was with me. “Its never about the times, I just wanted to finish the marathon. I had hit  miles at four hours and looked at my watch, wonderingClaire had finished yet.” Ann pictured after taking on the Belfast Marathon. Claire added: “I probably overloaded Ann with advice, but she is so laidback I worried she hadnt realised the mammoth task involved in training for a marathon. “Ann and I both have our set days for training and we dont sway too much from them, but we never ever miss the long runs. “We did a good few of them together, Id either go toMagheraor Ann would drive to Cloughmills, wed run  –  miles, but when we didnt run together Ann would tell me what she was doing and Id be messaging her to see how she got on. “On the morning of the marathon I messaged her from the start line, I genuinely couldnt feel any more proud. I was more worried about Ann than myself, I worried that shed get caught up in the crowds and have a struggle to finish. “When I crossed the line myself I phoned my husband, Damien, and he was in Belfast waiting on Ann coming in. I was so happy to know she had the support of him and her whole family, she knew I was there in spirit.” Ann concluded: “I felt so happy running myself and knowing Claire was fulfilling one of her dreams to run in the London marathon. “We have enjoyed so many runs together and I know we will enjoy many more – another marathon is definitely on the cards for me, so hopefully we can both be in the same place for it!” So what advice do the girls give to any budding runners  Or anyone that may think theyre too old to start running  Ann said: “I was nearly  when I started running, Id say do it for YOU, keep turning up, commit to your own training, dont compare yourself to another runner, everyone runs for dferent reasons – headspace, beating their own personal times, but my advice is to show up and do it for you.” Claire, who is also a Leader in Running Fitness at Ballymena Runners, added: “The best advice Id give anyone is to trust your training. The longer runs make you stronger as they build a resilience youll need in a marathon. Consistency is key, as is good nutrition, thats fuel for your body.” So as the two sisters recover and plan their next long run they both want to thank friends who offered support and encouragment to them both during their training, their running clubs and their families, who are all very proud of them both and think theyre an inspiration.

The two smaller events which instigated numerous social distancing protocols combined to create the largest gathering of tents at a music festival anywhere in Ireland in  and with that experience under their belts, the team behind the multi-award-winning event have decided that the best way to try and get back to normality is to press forward with one larger event for approximately , people. googletag.cmd.push Festival Director Ross Parkhill explained: “Despite the dficulties, the uncertainties and all the additional rules and regulations we had to impose, both events in  went off really well and people really worked incredibly well with us in order to ensure that was the case. “Running two events provided big challenges for us but happily, as always, our amazing team rose to the occasion twice and more people camped at a music festival at Stendhal than anywhere  on the Island of Ireland this year, something we can really be proud of.” Ross continued: “Going forward though, to continue with the model of two smaller events would not be practical for us and we are confident that people are a bit more confident themselves now about ing to large scale outdoor gigs, as witnessed at a number of events in Belfast throughout September.     “With that in mind, with the eradication of social distancing rules for outdoor spaces and with plenty of lessons learned from our events in , we are confident that we canto our usual event set up in  and safely welcome over , patrons to the farm once again.” Super Saver Early bird tickets for Stendhal  will be on sale on October thth at pm and will be available until January th, when the organisers are hoping to make their first batch of line-up announcements. “By moving the event forward by about  weeks we have to hit the ground running,” added Ross, “we also don’t have any major uncertainties aboutwe can run or not next year so expect us to have plenty of info regrading Stendhal  out early in the new year, when we will also be opening our annual artists submission process.” For tickets and more info regarding Stendhal Festival , visit www.stendhalfestival.

Sinn Feacuteins Cllr Sean Bateson used a discussion on Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils Grant Funding Policy Review to raise a question on the funding of a NI centenary event held at the weekend. googletag.cmd.push The event, part-funded by the Council, featured a historical re-enactment of a B-Specials drill demonstration and checkpoint, described by a local SDLP MLA as isive and crass. The organising committee of the event issued a statement to say no Council funding had been used to fund the demonstration. Cllr Sean Bateson Cllr Bateson asked officials at the Leisure and Development Committee to clary no public money had been spent on it. “I would like to speak on . on item  and specically, the NI small grants fund,” said the representative for Bann. “Can I ask the director for clarity on the awarding of this grant and in relation to the grossly inappropriate and deeply insensitive event at Coleraine Town Hall at the weekend      “My community was disgusted at this event and the re-enactment featuring a military display of the B-Specials. “The history of the B-Specials speaks for itself. It was effectively established as the paramilitary wing of the Orange state and was designed to subjugate nationalists and republicans. “For nationalists and republicans, such an event yet again clearly illustrates that the centenary of partition is being used by certain quarters as a show of triumphalism. “Can the director clary and put on recordthis grant went towards the funding and display of this event and the group that was involved in it  “Can the director give me a breakdown of the total Council funding and what it went towards ” Cllr John McAuley Committee Chair, Cllr John McAuley, told Cllr Bateson his question was not related to the agenda item the Grant Funding Policy Review. “You are quite aware that this isnt even part of the agenda,” said the DUP representative. “You did attempt to put in an AORBwhich you were too late for, and now you have decided to try and slip it in to make a few headlines with your republican agenda. “I try not to rise to these sort of things, but its a case of offended by everything and ashamed of nothing. Cllr Bateson began to protest that it was in fact part of the agenda, but Cllr McAuley told him he would chair the meeting as I choose to chair it. “Im the Chair, so Ill speakI want to speak. As a proud son of a B-man, I will not be letting you try and take over this Committee tonight to whitewash history. “Ill chair the meeting as I choose to chair it,” he added. Cllr George Duddy Cllr George Duddy then called a point of order, stating thatCllr Bateson continually interrupted the Chair, the Committee could vote on point of order . that the member not be heard on this item. “When the Chair speaks during the debate, any member speaking at the time must stop and the meeting must be silent,” said the DUP councillor. “Im not sure that Cllr Bateson understands standing orders, but you have asked him on more than one occasion, which is your perogative, to cease speaking, and he has continued to interrupt. “If Cllr Bateson continues, I will call point of order . for a member not to be heard any longer.” “Go ahead Cllr Duddy, I think it shows your agenda,” replied Cllr Bateson. The Committee then voted in favour of the point of order intervention, with nine voting for, two against and three abstentions. It marks the second time in four weeks that a Sinn Feacutein councillor has been subject to point of order . and no longer permitted to speak on an item. Cllr Duddy also called the point of order on Glens councillor Cara McShane at a previous meeting of the Leisure and Development Committee. The incident arose after a fellow DUP councillor claimed Cllr McShane insinuated he was a fool.

Destined operate centres in Derry and in Feeny, with the latter providing much needed services to more rural north Derry community. googletag.cmd.push Its aim is to build empowerment, address social isolation and exclusion and build lelong skills and self-confidence among its members. Fiona, Michael, Tamara, Peter, Owen, George, Kevin, Ryan and Gavin take a break from their cooking to speak to the County Derry Post last week. Through a iety of activities including karaoke, arts and crafts, cooking and gardening, the members have a busy week. Now, through funding provided by Rank Net Foundation under the Time to Shine project, the group are seeking to establish a new centre in north Derry to match their facility in the city. Some of the members spoke to the County Derry Post, and said more space was needed to complete their activities.     Kevin, Peter and Michael relaxing in the kitchen area of the centre in Feeny. “Its too small and we need more space to do our cooking and karaoke activities, and we havent much space for our computers upstairs,” said Tamara. “We could do with new computers too and maybe another sofa. Id love a nail bar to get some pampering done.” Kevin had his eye on a bigger TV. “We need the new centre because this one is too small. We need a bigger kitchen and a bigger TV,” he said. “If you have a bigger building you can space out more people and have better facilities for both children and adults.” Gavin is keen to show off the groups polytunnel outside the centre. George said everything about Destined was enjoyable, but that more space was the main priority. “I enjoy coming here, I like the people and the staff. Id be looking for more outside space as well. I love it here, but we need more room,” he said. A community survey was carried out earlier this month, with over  people taking part. Project Officer Grainne McNickle said the interest showed clearly an increased demand. “This has been an amazing response from the public,” she said. “The findings from this have strengthened the fact that there is an increasing demand for services in the rural areas to cater for everyone not just those with a Learning Disability. Cooking is just one of the activities the members enjoy at Destined. “Destined have been operating out of a small rented unit in Feeny for nearly ten years now and when the pandemic hit the building was deemed unsuitable for use. “A new centre would benefit Destined members, their family members, and will also be a great asset to people living in the surrounding area.” Alongside a consultation process, the group have worked closely with a steering committee of representatives from the Western Trust, local community groups and Rossmar Special School. The committee has completed a mapping exercise of where best to locate the new centre, and will begin the process of applying to potential funders when this is completed.

The proposal will be voted on by members of both branches in the beginning of November.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, A proposal to merge both the Derry and Claudy Credit Unions will be voted on by members at the start of next month. In a letter sent to members of Derrys Credit Union, the branchs President, Sean Hegarty, outlined the proposed merger and his reasons as to why this would benefit both unions googletag.cmd.push Earlier this year, the Directors of the Derry Credit Union were approached by their Claudy counterparts requesting a “transfer of engagements” to merge the two unions where the latter would switch its business to Derry. The proposal to members, which will be made at Derry Credit Unions agm on November , will be to vote on rubber-stamping the merger. Claudys members will be asked to do likewise at their own agm  hours later – a majority of members is needed to pass the proposal through. In the letter to his members, Mr Hegarty, wrote: “The merger with Claudy Credit Union will create a larger, well-resourced Derry Credit Union that will serve our combined common bond and reinforce our position as the leading credit union in Northern Ireland and in this region.     “We are excited by the opportunities that this merger will bring to our combined membership. “In coming together, we will broaden and enhance the range of services that we can offer to all our members, including additional online facilities and a wider-range of loan products. “It is you, our members, who will make the ultimate decision regarding this merger. Please take this opportunity to cast your vote and have your say in the future development of the credit union movement in the wider BT and BT postcode areas. “We firmly believe we are stronger together.” Meanwhile, Alliance Party Councillors, Rachael Fergusonand Philip McKinneyhave sent good wishes to the members of Derry and Claudy Credit Unions. “The two credit unions are considering merging together”, the Councillors said in a joint-statement. “Both Boards of Directors have approved a merger and they are recommending it to their members. And Derry Credit Union has already done its due diligence checks. So it looks like this merger will take place.” Cllr Ferguson added: “Derry Credit Union, once claimed to be the largest community-based credit union in the world, is an amazing success story. “It was founded only  years ago by  local people, with combined savings of pound.p – and now has over , members and over pound million of members savings.” Cllr McKinney said: “The whole Credit Union movement is a brilliant self-help story. “It has a proven track record across the world –  million members in over  countries. We wish well the members of Derry and Claudy credit unions in their coming decision.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party   How many familiar faces will you spot today.

The SDLP social justice spokesperson said timely payment of the Winter Fuel Allowance was crucial this year given rising energy costs and has called for additional support to help low-income households to heat their homes this winter. googletag.cmd.push It was announced earlier this week that gas bills would rise by  per cent with electricity going up by . Mr Durkan said: “The financial consequences borne out of the COVID pandemic are becoming clearer by the day. “Rising energy costs in conjunction with increasing financial precariousness caused by the end of furlough and the Universal Credit uplt, will force many low-income households to choose between heating or eating in the coming months. “It’s clear that a warm home during the winter period is not a luxury afforded to all and I acknowledge that support mechanisms such as the Winter Fuel Payment are in place for the older cohort.     “For those vulnerable people entitled to the Winter Fuel Payment, it will be of immense value this year in particular. “However, they cannot afford the same y delays which plagued the roll-out last year whereby some claimants weren’t receiving this vital payment until February or March. “I have written to the Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey urging her to liaise with the Department for Working Pensions who administer this scheme, to avoid a repeat of last year’s disaster. “She has given assurances that most Winter Fuel Payments will be paid automatically to qualying claimants during November and December, with all payments made by  January . “No-one should ever be left without this cold-weather crutch – this year it will provide a leline for many. “I have also appealed to Minister Hargey to explore a fuel support scheme for struggling households to mitigate against the rising costs of living compounded by the financial implications of the pandemic and cut to Universal Credit. “I understand a bid has been made and discussions have begun with the Utility Regulator and those within the sector to look into additional supports for families here.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party   How many familiar faces will you spot today.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

We are looking forward to other communities being informed and satisfied by the content from Iconic Media websites, expanding our footprint even further, he added.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party   How many familiar faces will you spot today.

In our society, that there continues to be injustice and inequality in our healthcare system is something that should shock us out of any potential apathy that all is rosy and well.ldquoAs we emerge from the pandemic, this should awaken us to action in a collective effort to take stock of where our health service is and what can be done to bring it to where it needs to be.Mr McGrath said healthcare staff must also be a priority for everyone as, without them, the health system would simply collapse.ldquoWithin the Downe Hospital for instance, we have seen staff moved about and relocated to other hospitals within the South Eastern Trust. And while it is important that the jobs of staff are secure, itrsquos also important that they have a sense of consistency and the opportunity to advance in their careers, he said.ldquoThe sad reality is that many of our staff are now burnt out a result of their work over the past  months. We need to sort out how our healthcare heroes are paid a wage that reflects the work they do and that they have proper working conditions.Mr McGrath said taking a critical look at how the ongoing waiting list is funded is also critically important which he also described as a priority moving forward.ldquoThe simple matter is that people are having to wait too long to see a consultant and the waiting lists are getting ever longer. This cannot go on, he declared.ldquoComing from a rural constituency we need to address how rural healthcare services are delivered and methodologies such as the community pharmacy can be supported in a way that enables them to challenge our rural health care needs.ldquoWhere this concerns the Downe Hospital specically is that it is essential that we have the services that meet the needs of the community. What I hear from people on the ground is that the Downe is ready to play itrsquos role,it was only supported from central government to do so.Mr McGrath said he is also conscious that many people are fearful about the future of GP services and are concerned that they cannot see their doctor.ldquoOur GP services have never been busier and our doctors work all day, every day. But the system is broken and needs to be fixed. There are many issues that are so important and need investigated and enhanced such as mental health, youth mental health, perinatal care, cancer services and more.ldquoAs I take up my partyrsquos health spokesman role, I am fully aware of the responsibility it involves and will now be endeavouring to meet with all of those stakeholder groups who I know will be instrumental in being a part of this.

This time it was Eilis Murphy who found her effort crossing the line after evading any resistance the Kilcoo defence had to offer.However, it was not to be plain sailing for Downpatrick, as immediately the Magpies sought to get a foothold on the contest.Kilcoo responded through a Caitriona Kane free, which was a reoccurring theme throughout the match. And one minute later, Kane once again converted from a free as her side began to enter the tie.There was a notable battle between Downpatrickrsquos Turley and Kilcoorsquos Laura Morgan, as the two tussled in what was a case of who wanted control of the possession more.Some neat triangle passing allowed Hoops forward Aisling Flynn to notch her first point of the game, before Adair Trainor overturned possession to release Cara Tumelty, who added further to RGUrsquos tally.Kilcoo displayed their class through Kane after an array of eye-catching passes found its way to the boot of the number , resulting in an applauded point.The scoreline would have been much closer at this stage had it not been for the goalkeeping heroics of player-of-the-match Kirsty Carling, who saved magnicently to deny a certain Magpies goal.Yet again Downpatrick did not allow themselves to be discouraged by the opposition, as Tumelty responded promptly with another point to close the scoring before the first water-break.The Hoops picked up where they left off as Tumelty pointed from a free after the restart, although her next effort just went the wrong side of the posts.Mulholland was in fine form as she dribbled past two opposing Kilcoo players to allow Tumelty to score a trio of unanswered points for her Downpatrick side.With  minutes gone, Kilcoo began ramping up their attacks and were nearly rewarded when Ceallach McEvoy played a lovely weighted pass over the RGU backline to allow Johnston through on goal.Showing the Downpatrick defence a clean pair of heels, Johnston seemed certain to put the ball in the back of the net. But, it was that woman Carling again who pulled off a terric save from point-blank range to a keep daylight between the sides.Mulholland pointed from a free at the other end of the pitch before Kilcoorsquos Kane replied with the same to keep her team present in the contest.The halftime whistle sounded to leave the scores - to - in favour of Downpatrick.It was very much a game of two halves as the teams ed to the pitch after the interval with Kilcoo immediately winning the throw-in before setting off on the charge downfield.Kane kicked over a point from range before Johnston secured another for the black and white outfit.A couple of wides occurred for both sides within the next few minutes, although the weather did take a turn for the worse, with rainfall and windy conditions beginning to increase.Kilcoo continued their onslaught with a Morgan point from open play, as Downpatrickrsquos Flynn saw her effort drt narrowly off the mark. But theMagpies continued their pressure and were soon awarded with a free  metres from goal.Dearbhla McGreevyrsquos effort ped just under the crossbar and was now causing all sorts of bother for Downpatrickrsquos Carling.The Hoopsrsquo number one watched the shot all of the way but could only slap the ball into the path of the onrushing Ceallach McEvoy, who bundled it over the line in the last piece of action before the second water-break.A terric  minutes for the Magpies meant that there was just a single goal separating the sides in the last quarter with the score - to - in favour of the Hoops.There was now a tense atmosphere both from the players on the pitch and the surrounding supporters, who had turned out to watch the final.Downpatrick goalscorer Murphy kicked over a point to finally get her side off the mark in the second half, although this was promptly answered with a fine solo point from the ever-present Johnston.As the clock ticked down, the tie was still very much in the balance when Tumelty registered another point to add to her impressive personal tally.With one last throw of the dice, Kilcoo charged down the pitch but was met with a plethora of green and white shirts who forced Kane to shoot from distance and settle for the point.That signalled the last score of the game as the final whistle was blown to cue pandemonium from the Downpatrick outfit and their management team.After the match, Downpatrick joint senior ladiesrsquo manager J R Loudon reflected on his sidersquos performance and season as a whole.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable, we took these girls way back in February and this was their end goal, he said. ldquoTheyrsquore a great bunch and we have a  of around  to  players. The feeling in the club as a whole at the minute is fantastic.ldquoMost of these girls are of minor age as wersquove lost a lot of our more experienced players to other commitments, so what they have achieved is remarkable.The manager added: ldquoWe knew Kilcoo were going to play using a sweeper, so we wanted to force their lsquokeeper into a long kick out that we were confident we would win. That game was won on the training ground.Kilcoo: S McEvoy, L Devlin, C McEvoy, C McClean, C McEvoy, E McEvoy, M Rogan, L Morgan, D McGreevy, R Doherty, C Kane, S Fettes, E Doyle, K Laverty, N Johnston.Subs: B McAneney, C McCrickard, C OrsquoRourke, C McEvoy Ireland, N OrsquoReilly, S McAneney, K Greenan, K McEvoy.Downpatrick: K Carling, C McKervey, O Boyle, O Beattie, N Loudon, A Trainor, V Scullion, K Turley, P Smyth, O Quinn, C Mulholland, K Convie, E Murphy, A Flynn, C Tumelty.Subs: M Shannon, R Trainor, A Doran, S Sloan, K McLeigh, G Scullion, N Madine, A Murphy, E McIlmurry, M Kelly, S Rice, K Trainor, M Ross..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20thOctober2021_cd.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 24%2C 2001  ","story":"BISHOPSCOURT ndash The sale of Bishopscourt Motor Racing Circuit should be clinched later today.It has also been confirmed that the sprawling track, which was put on the market at the start of the month, will remain a race circuit.Yesterday afternoon the circuitrsquos current owners, David Beattie and John Gfin, were locked in crucial talks with potential owner, Jim OrsquoBrien from Newry, in a bid to finalise the deal.Although the going price for the circuit has not yet been confirmed it is believed the final bid may be in the region of half a million pounds.Last month the Northern Bank changed the locks on the gates of the major complex after months of intense speculation surround its future.

This is just one of a number of similar incidents against council staff which have taken place in the area over the past few months.It is believed the people responsible for the recent attacks are members of a teen gang that has been running havoc in the village since before the summer.The same gang has been blamed for the brutal killing of a cat, which was burnt alive in the village last month. Its burnt carcass was left on display with a beer can between its paws and a cigarette in its mouth.One local resident recently claimed that people in the village are living in fear of the gang that continues to vandalise and destroy property in the village. The man said he also believes some of the teens may even be trying drugs after a number of used needles were found at the dock.KIRCUBBIN ndash Strangford Assemblyman, Kieran McCarthy, has reacted angrily to the weekend break-in and vandalism at the civic amenity site in Kircubbin.The politician said he has received numerous calls from residents in the area including Portaferry, Cloughey and Ballyhalbert about when he described as ldquowanton destruction of public property at ious locations around the Peninsula.ldquoOur constituents are extremely annoyed that good facilities provided out of public funds are being systematically destroyed by people who should know better.

Today, the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee is due to endorse a plannersrsquo recommendation to give permission for four new homes to be built on a quarter acre sloping site it owns at one of Killyleaghrsquos biggest housing developments.Council officials have earmarked a strip of open space land in front of homes at Grove Gardens at the Kerry estate located off the Downpatrick Road for the new homes.Ten letters and one petition objecting to the proposal were submitted to planners with the scheme part of the local authorityrsquos plan to sell off surplus land and buildings it owns across the district to generate cash.While the council does not build homes, residents opposed to its plan believe that the local authority is seeking planning approval which will signicantly increase the value of the land which it can then sell to the highest bidder.The plannersrsquo recommendation to grant outline permission for the land at Grove Gardens has angered residents and Rowallane councillor Billy Walker.It was confirmed earlier this year that none of the statutory agencies consulted about the proposal had objections, with the local authority pointing to the need for additional social housing in Killyleagh and a lack of available land to build new homes .In addition, the council contends that redeveloping the small portion of land at Grove Gardens would have ldquominimal impact on existing open space land and that the housing proposal will improve the estate physically and the attractiveness of Grove Gardens, ldquoproviding a quality and sustainable residential environment, better parking provision, a new vehicle turning area, additional footpaths and wider roadway.However, itrsquos a view not shared by residents or Cllr Walker who lives in nearby Grove Park.He said while arguments not to develop the land have failed, he is encouraging residents to object to any subsequent planning applications for full permission which will inevitably be forthcoming.ldquoThe case has been made by residents and myself that this piece of ground is simply not suitable for four homes, but planners disagree with us which is disappointing, he continued. ldquoWhile opposed to this proposal, I remain a passionate supporter of social housing and have worked alongside others to provide much-needed new accommodation and identy potential development sites.ldquoWhat we are talking about here is a proposal to make Newry, Mourne and Down Council a quick buck. This particular area of land is not suitable for social housing. I have no doubt thatan application to build private homes at this part of Killyleagh it would be refused.The Rowallane politician said while social housing provision is ldquoabsolutely critical given recent news that there are , people across the district looking for homes, the Grove Gardens site is inappropriate.He said that several years ago, along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, the pair were able to persuade roads officials to widen the road in front of existing homes at Grove Gardens to ensure emergency vehicles could gain access.Cllr Walker said while the local authorityrsquos outline planning application will be rubber-stamped later today, there is still some way to go before builders can move on site. He added: ldquoExisting homes at Grove Gardens would overlook the planned four semi-detached properties and I believe there is an issue in relation to peoplersquos privacy. Clearly, the planners donrsquot agree with me.ldquoI remain perplexed that planners view a piece of sloping ground as suitable for new housing. It is not in my opinion and, along with residents, I do not support to this proposal. There are more appropriate sites in my opinion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/portaferry(1).jpg","title":"Preservation order could help save trees  ","story":"A PRESERVATION order from the Department of Infrastructure may save trees earmarked for removal to build a new car and coach car park at the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry. A local campaign group mdash Portaferry Stop The Chop mdash applied for a tree preservation orderafter Ards and North Down Council rejected their alternative plans which would have reduced the number of planned parking spaces by nine, but saved most of the mature trees.The Department for Infrastructure confirmed this week that it is considering whether or not to make a TPO to protect trees, with a spokesman confirming that before deciding the matter, the Department must first consult with the local authority.ldquoFollowing formal consultation, the Department is now awaiting the views of council, the spokesman added.The matter will be discussed at the full council meeting next Wednesday with the organisation planning to invest pound, to clear the Portaferry site in order to create a new car and coach car park, new toilets, paths and lighting improvements in the Ropewalk area.The project aims to provide improved facilities for visitors to Exploris and the village and is viewed as a much-needed improvement in the wake of the planned poundm aquarium at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast. This proposal will mean that Exploris will no longer be the only aquarium in Northern Ireland.The new car-park, which has received funding from the Department for Infrastructure, should have been completed by November, but the council succeeded in getting an extension to the funding until January. However, Cathie McKimm from the campaign group, claimed that the council had wrongly given itself approval to remove the trees.ldquoThe council had not done environmental screening in its plans, which they are now doing and gave themselves unlawful permission to chop down the trees, she explained.ldquoWhen we wrote to the DfI, the planning headquarters wrote back to say that under the new legislation introduced in  when responsibility for planning transferred to councils, Ards and North Down was not allowed to give itself permission to chop down trees on land that it owned in a conversation area.She said that the council applied on September  to remove the trees which was followed up by the campaigners applying for the TPO.ldquoAll we know is that the trees are not saved yet, the original proposal is still on the table, said Ms McKimm.ldquoI have no confidence in this council to listen to what the community wants. Nearly , people signed a petition against this proposal and we reckon  per cent of those are from the Ards and North Down Council area.The group held a free concert, headlined by musician Colum Sands, at Portaferry Community Centre last Sunday in order to raise more public awareness of their concerns for the trees.Last year, the Co Down songwriterrsquos story-poem about the award-winning Invisible Tree of Rostrevor Oakwood, was given voice by neighbours and environmental campaigners aged from nine to  in the short film, Rhyme for Justice .Ards poet, Moyra Donaldson, wrote a poem for the  trees at Portaferry which was read out at the event, along with other poetry inspired by the local area.Lily Devlin, who started the campaign to save the tree, said that she and other campaigners in Portaferry have been ldquohumbled and inspired by the great support they have received in their campaign to save the trees, not just from local people and those from the Borough, but from all around the world.Speaking on behalf of the group she said: ldquoOver , people have now signed our petition mdash a testimony to the strength of opposition to the plans to destroy beautul trees in the heart of our historic town, for a car park, of all things.ldquoWersquove been trying as best we can to reason with the council over this absurd decision and get it to reconsider its plans but, to date, it has not taken its proposal to fell  trees for new parking off the table.A council spokeswoman confirmed that an updated report on the Portaferry Ropewalk Improvement Scheme will be brought to the full meeting next Wednesday and will include consideration of the Department for Infrastructurersquos proposals for a TPO in the area.She stressed that the council had not been aware of the need to get planning permission from the DfI for the removal of the trees until August.ldquoThis legislation had not been referenced by DfI Planning in any previous correspondence with the council about the proposed Scheme, she said. ldquoThe legislation requires the council to gain consent from DfI Planning for works carried out to any trees on land owned by the Council and within a conservation area.ldquoThis is anomalous with the Scheme of Delegation that DfI Planning has already approved for the council in relation to the decisions the Planning Committee can determine. However, having sought legal advice, the council has applied to DfI Planning for consent.The spokeswoman said that as per the councilrsquos standard procedures, the agenda for the meeting and a copy of the updated report will be available to the public on the councilrsquos website within  hours of them being made available to elected members..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Saintfield getting in bloom  ","story":"SAINTFIELD has again been recognised for its floral excellence after picking up third spot in the large village category at this yearrsquos Ulster in Bloom competition.Now in its rd year and sponsored by Translink, the transport companyrsquos Market Street base in Downpatrick came third in the bus station category.The annual awards celebrate the fantastic work of green-fingered gardening enthusiasts across the country, with the much-loved annual horticultural, environmental and community competition officially recognising the most beautul plant and floral displays across cities, towns and villages.Translink chairman, Michael Wardlow, said the company is proud of its long-standing role in Ulster in Bloom and it was great to see the competition grow each year, with  entries representing all local council areas as well as  bus and train stations entering this year.ldquoIt is heartening to see such fantastic demonstrations of community spirit in action, especially given the challenging times everyone has experienced, he continued.ldquoThese awards clearly highlight the pride so many have for their local areas.

In the absence of both John Donnan and James Simpson, Bradley Luney started in the second row and Jack Milligan came in at out half with Greg Hutley moving into midfield to cover the loss of Tagen Strydom.Shane Ball and Paddy Wright swapped positions as Adam Craig and his coaching team searched for the right formula in attack.Trinity were fresh off a demolition of UCD in the colours match and were able to choose from a full squad with Leinsterrsquos Liam Turner in midfield and highly regarded Ulster Academy prospect Harry Sheridan in the second row.Leinster senior squad regular Jack Dunne continued his rehab from injury with a place on the Trinity bench.Ballynahinch started badly with handling errors and a misfiring line-out inviting pressure.Despite some high quality scramble defence, they found themselves seven points down after a series of Trinity carries pinned them on their own line and quick hands and some good footwork took Max Faria over for a converted try.This was compounded by the loss of Milligan and prop Ben Cullen to injury.Another excellent defensive set allowed Ballynahinch time to dig in and they began to take the game to the students as the half wore on.A strong maul earned them a penalty on  minutes which Hutley knocked over from  metres to get his side on the board.Turner made a brilliant break just before half time but more superb scrambling kept the half time deficit at just four points.Ballynahinch had much the better of the opening exchanges of the second half and after going close to scoring a try, another Hutley penalty left the game delicately balanced.Turner then stamped his class on proceedings with a superb outside break on the Ballynahinch -metre line, opening up the defence for winger Marcus Kiely to score. Trinity then turned up the heat in the forwards and sealed the result with a close range try from a fine line-out move involving Dunne and Sheridan in the st minute.Thirteen points down with  minutes to go, Ballynahinch could have folded but they gamely stuck to their task and showed all their fighting spirit by attacking the Trinity line.They were rewarded with a try from Hutley on the gamersquos final play as he exploited the numerical advantage in the Trinity backline following a yellow card. He then calmly knocked over the conversion to salvage a point for his side.Despite opening with three defeats, Ballynahinch have shown improvement with each match and will be confident that they can soonto winning ways.They have a week off to regroup and rehab some injured players before the visit of table-topping Garryowen to Ballymacarn Park on October .Ballynahinch: B Cullen, T Stewart, K McCall, T Donnan, B Luney, Z McCall, O Loughead, C Irvine, C Gibson, J Milligan, A Cairns, G Hutley, R Wilson, P Wright, S Ball, J Hanlon, H Simpson, T Martin, D Souza, C McAuley, R Patterson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"UUP selects Macauley to contest Assembly election  ","story":"THE Ulster Unionist Party has selected Jill Macauley to contest next yearrsquos South Down Assembly election.A former Newry, Mourne and Down councillor, Mrs Macauley has secured the backing of her party and received a ringing endorsement from leader Doug Beattie.Mrs Macauley mdash who is a member of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council mdash said she is ldquodelighted to have secured her partyrsquos nomination to contest one of the five seats up for grabs.At the  Assembly election, Harold McKee was the UUP flag bearer and polled , votes, with the party confident that it can make a serious push for a seat when voters go to the polls next May.Based in Rathfriland, Mrs Macauley is one of the UUPrsquos most senior figures and having served as a councillor in two local authority areas, she now feels the time is right to ldquostep up and give the electorate of South Down a chance for change and a chance for positive and hardworking -pro-Union representation at Stormont.She described her work as a local representative as a ldquoprivilege, allowing her to meet and work with ldquosome wonderful people and great organisations within the constituency who do sterling work to support local communities and those most in need.Mrs Macauley revealed she has been working hard over recent months to grow the local UUP membership and said the optimism and resolve for a ldquomore confident and inclusive unionism has allowed her to continue working effectively with her party colleagues on a range of issues.She said these included the childrenrsquos funeral fund, transfer test, school unorm costs, disability and special educational needs improvement and period poverty.ldquoWe have a fantastic hardworking team of local councillors, working on the ground, always accessible and working for the greater good of local people, said the Assembly candidate.ldquoI want to thank my fellow councillors for the help and support they have given me thus far and encouraging me to step forward for election to the Assembly and the opportunity to lead our local team, as we strive to continue to be the strongest voice for Unionism right across South Down.Mrs Macauley said she hopes to prove that she is on their side and will be a strong voice for positive, confident Unionism.She added: ldquoFrom Katesbridge to Kilkeel and from Warrenpoint to St Johns Point, I have a bold, positive, ambitious vision for our people of South Down and am prepared to work with anyone to make that a reality.ldquoFor too long, we have been trapped in a perpetual cycle of fear and ision, resulting in every election becoming a constitutional show of strength rather than a mandate for socio-economic change.

Please try again later.Submitting...Emotional states, as any psychologist knows, grossly distort perceptions of reality.They are easy to manipulate via modern media and spin, whilst reason and rationality require scientic discipline and mental rigour.Woke issues are media-friendly precisely because they have emotional impact, and because the media are dominated by woke educated arts and humanities folk who lack real ‘scientic’ training.Further, most media folk are middle class, and woke issues don’t threaten their materially-comfortable lestyles.Thus banning speakers, political correctness, and emotional outrage don’t involve paying higher taxes to resource practical real solutions for example, providing better healthcare, welfare, or social services – things that really and inclusively help all races and creeds.One can still have a second home in France and feel emotionally good by being politically correct.Woke issues often do exist, like racial inequality, but their understanding of them and proposed solutions are infantile and downright dangerous - like, for example, where curbs on freedom of speech are concerned.They also ignore white inequalities, like working class deprivation in ‘post-industrial’ society, making working people feel bitter – hence Labour’s drubbing in Northern England.Yet the flight of the Left from reason has rational explanations, e.g. the collapse of the Soviet Bloc founded on Marx’s Enlightenment ideal of scientic socialism.The Left sought a quick alternative and found it in sloppy ‘touchy-feely’ politics, instant emotive issues, and symbolic gestures like toppling statues or political correctness.Marx would have scorned such empty, gesturing fools.Modern society is frequently unjust and re with real socio-economic and political problems, but the solutions lie in painstaking, tedious analysis and long-term planning, resources and delivery systems, not grand posturing.In such a world there is a serious need for a Left to challenge greedy self-interest - doing this is even fundamental to a liberal democratic society.Here, Ulster’s heritage could provide a template. Modern economics and Enlightenment thought actually has its roots in the Ulster moral philosopher Francis Hutcheson‘Father of the Scottish Enlightenment’ and man who taught Adam Smitheconomics .Both men were moral philosophers who would never advocate greedy self-interest.They saw the greatest virtue and happiness in dong good for ones community and fellow man .What Hutcheson taught Smith was that by removing articial constraints, from race to socio-economic disadvantage, over an inidual’s ability to develop their talents to the full enabled men to make a greater contribution to their community and fellow men.This Enlightened, moral dimension of market economicsis usually ignored.But it represents an ‘old’ Left critique of market economics, something which requires the rationality and reason of a disciplined mind - which modern woke-ism now eschews for emotive gestures.• James Dingley is a former international lecturer and NATO Instructor on terrorism and editor of: Combating Terrorism in Northern IrelandMore News Letter letters and opinion at this link——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...But there are two wider issues that can, and should, be talked about in general terms now.The first is the DUP approach to north-south.It is entirely justied. The party’s previous stance was confusing with regard to north-south but it has made the right call in toughening its position. East-west connections have been trashed. A trade barrier so major has been put in the Irish Sea that the UK itself is trying to overhaul the protocol it agreed. London is rightly pointing out that this was agreed while its hand was tied by parliament. Let us hope that it maintains this tough stance.The other wider issue that deserves examination is legal costs in Northern Ireland. To a remarkable extent, government actions in the province are challenged in the courts, at great expense, often funded by legal aid.This Conservative government had said that it wanted to curb the ability of the courts to constrain elected governments, as well it should.So here are two issues on which the government could do what it says it wants to do.First, give whatever moral support it can to the DUP in the party’s attempt, via a north-south boycott, to respond to the damage to the  Belfast Agreement, a deal which the government is citing in its efforts to reform the protocol.Second, to pay particular attention to the wider matter of use of judicial review in NI, and its immense cost.LondonDUPBelfastNorthern IrelandIrish Sea  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularUnionists clash with Irish senators at Stormont over Brexit and NI protocolGAA breaks silence after seven days to explain how dissident republican parade linked to Lyra McKee was able to use club grounds‘Hurt and offence’ caused by former IRA man promoting business in town he bombedVeterans’ representative ‘heard no new evidence” at trial of Dennis HutchingsStephen Nolan issues open invite to trangender lobbyists amid explosion of anger at his BBC investigationMost PopularArmagh centenary service: dissidents denounce British ‘genocide’ and anti-abortionists slam churches themselvesLeader of Free Presbyterian Church says his denomination is ‘grieved’ about ‘ecumenical’ joint church service in Armagh for NI CentenaryGAA remains silent for seven days after dissident republican parade linked to Lyra McKeeArmagh centenary service: ‘St Patrick had every reason to hate the Irish – but he didn’t’ Doug Beattie declined to stand alongside Dennis Hutchings during the trial                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLeaving the main car park and tramping pavements along Heol Gorllewin to pass the Prince of Wales pub, which features in the tale of the Maid of Sker, the group then entered the southern part of the vast Kenfig Burrows. These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

NormandierCouncillor Neil Thomas, a former governor at Evenlode, said: ldquoOne problem was the transition from Bute Cottage to Evenlode, because Bute Cottage was using dferent reading and numeracy schemes from Evenlode. It was a source of irritation for the reception teachers that they had to basically reteach the children to fit into the new schemes.ldquoThis change should improve that situation, because yoursquore not going to get that conflict of schemes.ldquoTherersquos a lot of misinformation going around, and therersquos a lot on social media saying that the Bute Cottage site is going to be closed and developed, and the open area next to it is going to become a building site. None of which is referred to in this report and all of which has been denied.ldquoTheyrsquore alleging that there are plans to move Bute Cottage physically and rebuild it on the grounds of Evenlodemdashagain that is something expressly ruled out. But thatrsquos something being put out on social media, and Irsquom wonderingthatrsquos for political reasons to stir up anxiety and worry among the community. There are no such plans in place.As part of the public consultation, a cabinet report was published describing the merger plans in detail. According to Cllr Gordon Kemp, chair of the scrutiny committee, some of the concerns could be caused by people not reading that -page report in full.He said: ldquoI think part of the problem with the original cabinet report was the reference that they would remain in the same buildings was tucked away in the report. It wasnrsquot there right at the beginning, and perhaps some people donrsquot read as far as they should, unfortunately.However, the cabinet report, towards the end, discussed how the council would indeed consider relocating the nursery. It said: ldquoShould the proposals be approved, the council would prioritise relocating nursery provision at Evenlode Primary School onto a single site.The report added the council would first assess the feasibility of the relocation, and would then also consult the public before any changes.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education and regeneration, denied there were any plans to relocate the nursery. But she added the council would ldquoprobably exploreit were possible.She said: ldquoThere are no plans to change the sites of either the nursery schools. There is a small section in the consultation document that says that there would be feasibility work undertaken to see whether or not there should be a move over to the Evenlode site. Itrsquos one of those things where yoursquore damnedyou do and damnedyou donrsquot.ldquoIf we hadnrsquot put anything in and somebody had said lsquowhat are you going to do about moving to one sitersquo, we would say wersquoll probably do some feasibility work on it to see whether or not itrsquos an option. Butwe put it in, then itrsquos a done deal. Itrsquos not a done deal.ldquoI really donrsquot know how you could build a separate nursery on the Evenlode site, but thatrsquos my personal view. Butthat feasibility work proved that it were possible, then you would have to go right the way back to another consultation. This is purely about amalgamating management and governance s within the schools.The consultation runs until November  and details of the plans can be found on the councilrsquos website. If approved, the mergers would take effect from September . The two nurseries are currently some of the last remaining standalone nurseries across the Vale. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Ms Hall is in a better place mentally now and is a self-development coach and speaker. Two years after her breakdown, she set up her own business, ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity Mind and she is a volunteer director for Mind Cymru.She also started writing as a cathartic exercise but, upon realising she could help others, decided to write a book: Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work.ldquoThe book is a combination of my personal story and insights from neuroscience to help people cope with, manage and bounce back from burnout, said Ms Hall.ldquoI still have my ups and downs, like anyone , but I feel like I am the one in charge of me. I still get tired and fed up, but the dference now is that I know when Irsquom reaching the tipping point between wellness and illness.ldquoI know when I need to stop and restore my energy levels. I have learnt that health and self-care come first. Without that nothing  happens anyway.Ms Hall now takes time to be mindful and enjoy time with her daughters. She values her loved ones more than ever before and ndash although shersquos still passionate about her work ndash knows ldquowhen it has to come second.OTHER NEWS:ldquoI donrsquot derive my sense of achievement and wellbeing from others anymore ndash I get that from me, said Ms Hall.ldquoI hope people who read my book know that it is okay not to be okay whoever you are and whatever your circumstances.ldquoDonrsquot let pride or fear of failure prevent you from taking action to help yourself. You need to understand who you are before you can change anything my book talks about awareness, acceptance, and action.ldquoIf you understand yourself ndash who you are and why you respond to le the way you do ndash then you can choose to change and respond dferentlyyou want to.ldquoI had the choice to stay where I was or get better: I chose to get better.ldquoThank you to anyone who reads the book.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
