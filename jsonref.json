For Mandira Sarkar, owner of Mandira’s Kitchen, and deluxe doughnut makers Project D, pivoting quickly has become almost as much of an art form as their products. Sarkar’s business, launched in 2016, is based in a converted 16th-century barn outbuilding overlooking the picturesque Silent Pool lake near Guildford, Surrey. With an all-female (“except for one very brave man”) staff of 20, it produces home-style freezer meals – authentic, healthy dishes such as watercress dal and chicken xacuti, plus a range of samosas and biryanis. The business has a catering service, an onsite cafe and shop, and a cookery school. Pre-pandemic, it also offered spice tours for groups keen to learn about Indian flavours, followed by a meal in the cafe. But Mandira’s Kitchen has had to adapt almost every component of its operations. When they had to close their kiosks, the team had to completely rethink their business model. “We initially furloughed our 26 members of staff,” says Poynton. A few weeks later, though, as public demand for baking essentials skyrocketed, they brought them all back – Project D’s access to local farms had put them in a good position to sell eggs, flour and yeast. “We got our gazebo out and we were popping up in village car parks and town square car parks. We had hour-long queues for eggs. Looking back, it was really insane,” Poynton says. Once given council permission to sell doughnuts alongside the other staple essentials, they also started a doughnut delivery service, which has continued to attract high demand. Sarkar, too, remembers panicking “for about two days”, but then she and her team quickly got to work. Farm shops – the main customers of their freezer meals – were themselves struggling, so she began to market to inidual customers instead. Launching a brand new website, Sarkar pushed out the message that their tasty, healthy meals were perfect to have at home, and available at the click of a button. Local orders were soon followed by UK-wide demand. Sarkar kept innovating. First she enhanced her click-and-collect service, offering weekend thali feasts, a three-course meal complete with a Bollywood playlist, a quiz on India, and takeaway picnic baskets. They began to collaborate with a nearby vineyard and gin distillery, offering meals with accompanying wine, and jointly marketing to customers against the backdrop of the growing consumer movement to buy locally. Sarkar is also leading a weekly free cooking lesson that people can follow on Instagram Live. A special kit of six spice blends can be ordered beforehand to ensure the outcome is authentic. All these adaptations, says Sarkar, have resulted in their pandemic-era sales far outstripping the previous year’s. Both Sarkar and Project D mention the importance of persevering even when the going gets tough. “We’ve always had the attitude of never giving up,” says Bond. “We have this dream, this project, which we hold so dearly. And when that was nearly taken away from us, with everything that we put in, we weren’t ready to give up.” Strong branding was also key to Project D, who sold eggs using trays in their signature bubblegum pink. Their scooter, mini pickup truck, forklift and even the floors of their new bakery are all painted in the same shade. Although difficult in a pandemic, planning ahead as best as they can has also been an important element of their success. As the end of the Brexit transition period loomed, the team stockpiled some of their ingredients. “And we were right to do that, because some of our wholesalers actually ran out of some of our key ingredients,” says Poynton. For both of these independent food businesses, the past year has been hectic, often stressful, but in the end, hugely rewarding. For Sarkar, it has sometimes meant 18- or 19-hour days at work. “You can probably see the bags under our eyes,” she says. “But we’ve constantly, every day, innovated, adapted and been flexible at every single stage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"from diy kits to sustainable bespoke furniture meet the businesses reshaping interior design","story":"Given this, the digital video meetings we’ve all become used to can only take a designer so far. Nonetheless, the sector itself is proving resilient eight out of 10 people, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) in October, wanted to change their homes as soon as it was safe to do so. “The impact of Covid-19 will affect how and where we choose to live for years to come,” says Riba president Alan Jones. “For many of us, our homes are our sanctuaries, and this research indicates that many people are keener than ever to adapt and improve their homes.” Many interior designers across the UK report an increase in the number of new clients they have taken on. But as the process relies so heavily on being physically present in a space, they have had to adapt. Zoe Hewett is no stranger to finding creative ways around problems. When she first started her interior design business, Stylemongers of Bristol, the former set designer for theatre and TV productions lacked the funds to make over her own home to serve as a showcase – so instead she built a doll’s house to demonstrate her style. As a result of the pandemic, Hewett scaled back her face-to-face work, but has still found ways of expanding her business – one of which is a range of interior design kits to help people design their own homes. “At first, I was thinking about making my services accessible,” she says. “A one-to-one design consultation is worth doing for a bespoke service, but it’s always going to be out of reach for some people, so I wanted to offer something affordable, at a price point more people could afford.” The pandemic meant the project became a priority for her business, and the packs became a reality. “I may have created an envelope-stuffing role for myself,” she says. “But I love that people are getting something physical and tangible to work with.” The packs are made of recycled card and paper and are delivered in letterbox-sized packages. Hewett sees them as a way of sharing the information and techniques that she previously discussed in face-to-face workshops, where she would guide groups through the principles of interior design – from creating moodboards to where to place furniture. They contain, among other things, quizzes to help buyers explore design choices, advice on using colour and materials to create 2D-scale layouts of rooms, plus a link to an ebook with further information. Hewett says the take-up of the £50 kits has been “pretty good. I hope people find them fun as well as useful. One lady who bought one said she’s using it again with her seven-year-old to reimagine their shed. Her daughter’s got really into it, apparently.” From each commission, Hewett makes a donation to the homeless charity Crisis. “Creating nice places is what drives me,” she says. “So it makes sense to me to also help people who haven’t got anywhere to live yet.” The community focus is also important to Liselle Milner of Zenterior Design, based in St Austell, Cornwall. She works with 12 others, including builders, carpenters and upholsterers, to create indoor and outdoor spaces and bespoke furniture, all with a focus on using sustainable materials. Much of her work involves second homes or holiday lets, so the owners have not been able to travel to meet her. “We’ve always focused on the relationship with the client, getting an idea of exactly what it is they want and then making that happen, so to never meet someone face-to-face has been very odd,” she says. “Although, if you are talking to someone via Zoom, there is the advantage of seeing their house in the background, so it’s a very quick way of seeing what they already like.” Milner uses a lot of secondhand or upcycled furniture – “I want the space to look as amazing as possible for the budget we have” – but her pre-pandemic visits to charity shops and auctions have been replaced by Facebook Marketplace, and ever-greater resourcefulness as a team. “We’re looking at things we would usually outsource, like quilting, for example, and thinking: ‘Can we do that ourselves?’” she says. “It’s good creatively, and it also means we can keep to a schedule. Big furniture retailers have set specifics they work to. If a piece is made of oak, and if the oak isn’t there, then that sofa won’t be with you in 12 weeks’ time. But if we are making it, then we can use beech or another suitable wood that we can actually get hold of.” Besides changing their ways of working to comply with pandemic-related restrictions, such as visiting sites inidually instead of together, the Zenterior team have also adapted some of the other physical parts of their jobs, finding ways to keep to social distancing rules, and have stopped working on occupied domestic properties. Milner has also doubled down on Zenterior’s commitment to using local suppliers, not only to avoid delays with supply chains but also from a sense of local responsibility, as the regional tourism sector has been hit especially hard by restrictions on movement. “And there’s also the fact that Cornwall has always been a hub for artists and creative people. It makes sense to work with people who are here,” says Milner. The pandemic may have affected their traditional ways of working for now, but both Milner and Hewett are determined that its lasting effects on our homes are sustainably positive.

Photograph: Gerard McCarthyWhile wellbeing is the new buzzword in the school curriculum, many educators feel the key to positive mental health is something which has been with us all along.“I would see nature as being the real mindful education,” says Dr Paddy Madden, Heritage in School specialist, former primary school teacher and college of education lecturer.“Whether you’re are listening to birds, smelling the flowers or gardening you are in the now and whatever big worry was weighing down on you dissipates, being in nature melts down the worries.”Madden says teachers play a key role in creating opportunities for children to notice nature. “Forget about the objectives, forget about the assessment, just get them to notice. Noticing nature a few times during the week has a huge effect on their mental wellbeing.”To this end, we’ve collected some of the best nature-based resources available to schools which may help you to see that sometimes the grass is greener in your own school garden.Engage with Nature engagewithnature.ieThis website offers resources for teachers and children that help promote a sustainable environment, while also encouraging positive climate action and improving personal wellbeing.It contains month-by-month instructions for schools wishing to create a school garden. There are explanatory videos and downloadable materials for teachers including how to make a cultivation bed, measure a tree or make a scarecrow.The website also provides hands-on activities for children to do at home with a parent or . Activities range from how to grow seedlings to growing carrots in a dustbin. Each activity is paired with a video explainer.Niall Hatch of Birdwatch Ireland has been visiting schools and delivering workshops for nearly 15 years.“When I go to schools, they tend to know a lot more about the wildlife of sub-Saharan Africa or the Amazon rainforest than they do about the wildlife of their own county and I think that that is a real shame,” says Hatch. “They tend to think of nature as something very far away, something you only experience as a special treat.”Hatch says it is important that children learn about local wildlife so they can see how it relates to their own lives. “People won’t want to protect the things that they don’t understand.”The Birdwatch Ireland website has a series of downloadable lesson plans and teaching materials for schools. It also offers talks to schools where possible and hopes to provide more workshops for teachers in the future.“We have learned that while there is certainly a benefit to going in and giving a talk to schools, what is better, sometimes, is to educate the educators so that nature isn’t seen as a half hour break once a year but is something that goes through the ethos of the whole school,” says Hatch.“A lot of research has been done into what has been termed ‘nature-deficit disorder’,” he adds. “There are strong mental-health benefits from immersion in nature. Especially with Covid and all that is going on, immersion on nature can really help.”This international initiative aims to foster an interest in nature and the conservation of migratory birds in children. They can post their first sightings of birds such as the swift and the cuckoo to the website.“We are asking people to help us track migratory birds mainly so that we can work out what the average date would be each year for the arrival of these species, not necessarily what the earliest one is but when the bulk of them are coming because that tells us a lot about climate change,” says Hatch.The website, designed to appeal to children, contains bird fact-files along with images and species related migration information.The children can also watch videos and live streams via Bird TV and the Spring Alive YouTube page.The children will find tips on how to build a nest box, how to feed the birds when there is a food shortage and advice on how to become a good birdwatcher.Zoologist Mairéad Stack is running a series on webinars for third to sixth class primary school students for the month of May.“I am going to be showing them how to make some nature crafts and talking to them about what they can do for wildlife because quite often they are watching videos about the Amazon but in Ireland we have wildlife and we have wildlife around your school,” says Stack. Children will learn how to identify tracks left by local wildlife such as foxes.The webinars will also help students identify what they can do in their own garden. “Can you build a little log pile in the corner of your garden which might be used by hedgehogs to snuggle in underneath or put up two different kinds of bird feeders, one that a robin might like and one that a goldfinch might like?” says Stack. “Really simple stuff but really good practical actions for wildlife.”Webinars run every Thursday in May at 9:30am.This website has a section for schools containing downloadable materials on pollination. The Junior Pollinator Plan explains what pollination is, why it is important and what schools can do to help. The school section of the website has short videos and fun animations for the students to watch.There are a series of 10 lesson plans. Each lesson has learning objectives and all necessary information compiled for teachers to use. They come with suggested activities based on class level and ability.“The All Ireland Pollinator Plan has done a magnificent job of providing resources to schools and communities,” says Stack. “It has made massive difference in terms of providing resources to teachers, literally giving them the information which has been lacking up until now.”The nature tableThe nature table that once held pride of place in every primary school has been uprooted in recent years – but many are reintroducing it back into its educational habitat.“I learned my nature in primary school through a nature table,” says Madden. “It was interactive, we brought in stuff every day, the teacher spent half an hour each day on what we found.”Madden says this empowered them as young learners because they were leading the learning.“We loved that time of day and that is what got me into nature and that what was landed me into my career.”Madden says the table should be interactive and reflect the seasons and should be changed weekly.This solutions-focused climate action programme aims to not only provide students with practical hands-on tasks that enable them to be proactive in their approach to climate action but it also aims to reduce the anxiety many students feel around climate change.“Fear does not kindle creativity, guilt does not inspire new ideas, and anxiety does not drive action. We need to give our students a sense of hope, a feeling of ownership, and the promise of immediate tangible results. We want to give students the tools to help rewrite their future, and the future of the planet,” says Vicki Brown, chief executive of Cool Planet Experience.The Rewrite Climate programme, currently aimed at transition-year students, has 12 climate change lessons on topics such as transport, energy, sustainable fashion and food.The school grounds“We are very fortunate in our school that we have a beautiful school garden and a green-fingered caretaker, the beauty of the on-site garden being its accessibility,” says Niamh Egan, primary school teacher at St Canice’s boys school in Finglas, Dublin.Teachers have been using the garden area for social skills lessons as well as promoting nurturing and co-operative behaviours.“The digging, planting and watering have great benefits for students’ fine and gross motor skills. Children have a natural affinity to nature and a school garden, or even a few raised beds, can really create a fantastic learning environment.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Solar, wind and nuclear are building blocks towards target, says International Energy AgencyMike Hayes: Companies who embrace low carbon technologies will be the winnersThe Luggala Estate extends to more than 1,800 hectares and is one of Ireland\u0026rsquos most spectacular upland landscapes"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

On Monday, she marked the relaxation of Covid-19 rules with a delayed Christmas sale.“We didn’t have time to have a proper sale after Christmas so we have our winter stock on a rail for €15 where there are dresses that would have been selling for €140. But there’s no point holding on to things,” she said.“It is heartbreaking. But we are lucky to still be here. We have a wonderful loyal community,” said McCormack. “All the pre-ordered stuff was arriving all through February and March so that was stressful, with boxes everywhere.”Despite the 15 months of restrictions, Ennistymon has managed to remain busier than most towns throughout the three lockdowns since it is a main hub for food shopping in north Clare with a Supervalu and an Aldi.Passersby called out “welcome back” to Noreen Twomey Walsh, whose cottage homewares shop, Serendipity, first opened in July 2020: “This is our first time open this year and we are excited but it’s been hard. I love the interaction with the people and I missed that,” she said.She and her husband, John, relocated their shop from Ennis to Ennistymon in the middle of the first lockdown. “We decided to have an easier life, come back home and that’s where we are, loving it.The couple rent the premises and used Government supports to help pay the bills while their shop was closed.A few doors up, Carol McGann is back behind the counter in her gifts and homewares shop, Fancy That. “Our last day of trading was Christmas Eve, so this is like our new year.

I wouldn’t like to tell you how much I’ve paid out since January and nothing coming in. There were days when you were so down, so depressed, but ultimately you just have to try and look at the positives,” she said.In the town square, weaver Jean Moran is back at the loom in her studio and shop where she sells one-off hand-spun garments and art.“I am renting and I’ve had all the bills to pay but in one way during lockdown you are spending less than you normally would so it balances out,” she said. She had a good summer season in 2020 with Irish tourists making a concerted effort to support local business.“It’s like their eyes could see crafts again and they appreciate it and they genuinely want to support us,” said Moran.The same thing happened to musician Brendan Lynch at the bottom of Parliament Street when the public came through the door of his small specialist fiddle shop, expertly restored after he bought the Georgian building six years ago. The original countertop and shelving were saved during the work, used now to display fiddles sourced at auction, as well as architectural prints. He plans to host intimate music sessions in his shop, called Byrne’s Violin Shop, to showcase his skills this summer.“The Irish visitors come to town and they are bowled over by the shopfronts they come in with their kids, I play them a tune and they want a bit of art to take away with them. A totally different animal than your tourist from America that comes in and loves the shop and thinks they’ve walked into a concert but they wouldn’t buy a thing,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nama close to approving sale of 69 dublin apartments to uk based fund","story":"The Casino development in Malahide, Co Dublin. Photograph: The CasinoThe State’s National Asset Management Agency (Nama) is close to signing off on the bulk sale of 69 apartments in Malahide, Co Dublin, to a UK-based investment fund.A deal has been reached in principle to sell the apartments at The Casino development in Malahide village to SeaPoint Capital, a serial block-buyer of apartments for the rental market.Some 34 apartments in the complex were sold to private buyers for an average price of €433,000 over the past 2½ years. Nama is selling the remaining unsold apartments in bulk. SeaPoint is the preferred bidder. The apartments are part of the properties owned by Gerry Gannon, one of the most prolific property developers of the boom-time era, whose loans were sold to Nama. The average market value of the remaining properties in the Malahide development is between €400,000 and €450,000, valuing the deal at up to €31 million.SeaPoint’s Dublin-based chief executive Kieran Gilmartin said he wasn’t in a position to comment.A spokesman for Nama also declined to comment. The State agency, set up in the wake of the financial crash, is legally obliged to secure the best price for properties in the recovery of loans.The Labour spokeswoman on housing, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, said proposals being considered by Cabinet today to ringfence a percentage of newly built homes for first-time buyers should be extended to encourage more apartments to be sold to owner-occupiers. She called on Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien to introduce stamp duty changes to make it less financially attractive for investment funds to buy apartments here, warning of an “oligopoly” in the rental market.“The Minister should ask Nama to step in and not to sign off on a sale like this,” she said.Attracted into the market by high rents, SeaPoint has been buying up large numbers of apartments in recent years, including in Dublin city centre, Blanchardstown and Tallaght.

File photograph: Peter ByrnePA WireFuture housing developments will have up to 30 per cent of properties earmarked for first-time buyers under plans which will be brought to Cabinet by the Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien.As part of the memo, so-called cuckoo funds would be restricted from bulk purchasing in specified developments.Details around the exact kind of developments which will be subject to these rules were still being worked on last night.The department will propose setting out the new rules around bulk buying in a planning circular.The department will also propose to introduce amendments to the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 which would earmark a certain percentage of properties for first time buyers in future developments. While the exact figure had not been signed off last night, sources said it will likely be around 30 per cent on top of Part V provisions which stipulate a development must have 10 per cent social and 10 per cent affordable housing.Sinn Féin spokesperson on Housing Eoin Ó Broin said that any changes to planning law “must apply to existing developments if bulk buying of homes intended for owner occupiers is to stop”.“There are ways to do this without falling foul of the Constitution. It would also be an enormous mistake to limit such restrictions to low density suburban developments,” he said.The Minister has insisted that it is an absolute priority to “level the playing pitch” for first time home buyers.Introducing his Affordable Housing Bill, which aims to make housing more affordable to rent or buy for low to medium income households, he confirmed that work is underway to expand Part V of the Planning Act with regard to the percentage of housing in developments that builders are obliged to provide for social and affordable units.Speaking in the Seanad Mr O’Brien said this will include designating a range of units for first time buyers.Referring to the issue on institutional funds buying up completed housing estates,the Minister said “work is underway with the Attorney General, right now, to bring these amendments forward to further the playing pitch for first time buyers, which is an absolute clarity from the government”.He warned however that “to refuse to use the private sector, is to fight with one hand behind our back”.In apparent criticism of Sinn Féin, Mr O’Brien said “we need to stop letting one party’s perfect be the enemy of everyone else’s good when faced with this crisis”.He said that “silver bullet fantasies and hysteria politics do a generation locked in a rent trap a grave disservice. I’m committed to using every weapon in our arsenal to fight the battle and turn the tide in our housing crisis.”And he said the State would play a central role, “the biggest role, the State has played in generations” with a “a major leap forward in our housing policy”.The most controversial element in the Bill is the shared equity scheme in which the State takes a stake of up to 20 per cent to bridge the affordability gap between an inidual’s mortgage limits, and the price of the unit.Mr O’Brien said it had received “intentionally distracting focus”.He said the shared equity scheme “will work in conjunction with the Help to Buy scheme to get people into homes this year” and it will help “turn Generation Rent into a generation back and own their own home”.Mr O’Brien stressed that “safeguards are being dealt in to tailor eligibility to meet inidual affordability” and the scheme “will not compel homeowners to borrow more than they can afford”."},{"url":null,"title":"israel gaza strikes continue overnight as global diplomacy ramps up","story":"Smoke and flames rise following an Israeli air strike on Gaza City, May 18th 2021. Photograph: Mohammed SaberEPAMore than a week of fighting between Israel and Hamas showed few signs of abating on Tuesday despite intense US and global diplomacy to stop the region’s fiercest hostilities in years.The Israeli military said late on Monday that Hamas and other Palestinian groups had fired about 3,350 rockets from Gaza – 200 of them on Monday alone – and that Israeli air and artillery strikes had killed at least 130 militants.Gaza health officials put the Palestinian death toll at 212, including 61 children and 36 women, since hostilities began last week. Ten people have been killed in Israel, including two children.Amid seemingly fruitless diplomatic efforts to stop the violence, the top US military officer, Gen Mark Milley, warned that the violence could spread.“My assessment is that you risk broader destabilisation and you risk a whole series of negative consequences if the fighting continues,” Gen Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told reporters before landing in Brussels on Monday for talks with Nato allies. “It’s in no one’s interest to continue fighting.”Israeli air strikes on the Palestinian enclave continued overnight. Soon after dawn, missiles struck two buildings in Gaza City, sending plumes of thick smoke into the air.Militants in the Strip fired rockets early on Tuesday that set off sirens in southern Israeli cities, sending thousands running for bomb shelters.There were no immediate reports of injuries on either side.The overnight rocket fire from Gaza appeared to be less than in previous nights. There was a six-hour lull in rocket fire overnight before they again began being launched at dawn, according to rocket siren information from the Israeli military.A Reuters correspondent also reported a lull in overnight rocket fire from Gaza, an enclave home to two million Palestinians.White HouseUS president Joe Biden expressed his support for a ceasefire during a call with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu on Monday, the White House said in a statement.But Mr Netanyahu told Israelis earlier that strikes against militant sites and leaders in Gaza would carry on.“The directive is to continue to strike at terror targets,” he said in a televised speech, after meeting with military and intelligence chiefs. “We will continue to act as necessary to restore peace and security to all residents of Israel.”The armed wing of Hamas promised more rockets in return: “The criminal Zionist enemy intensified its bombing of homes and residential apartments in the recent hours, and therefore, we warn the enemy that if it did not stop that immediately, we would resume rocketing Tel Aviv,” said spokesman Abu Ubaida. US secretary of state Antony Blinken urged all sides to protect civilians.Although stressing that Israel had the right to defend itself, Mr Blinken said he had not seen any evidence from Israel about its suggestion that Hamas was operating out of a building housing media outlets – including the US-based Associated Press – which was destroyed in an Israeli missile strike at the weekend.Hamas denied having offices in the building. “These are false allegations and an attempt to justify the crime of targeting a civilian tower,” said Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum.Egypt and UN mediators also stepped up diplomatic efforts, while the UN General Assembly will meet to discuss the violence on Thursday.The Biden administration approved the potential sale of $735 million in precision-guided weapons to Israel, and congressional sources said on Monday that US politicians were not expected to object to the deal.TensionsHamas began its rocket assault last Monday after weeks of tensions over a court case to evict several Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, and in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near the city’s al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam’s third-holiest site, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.The hostilities between Israel and Hamas-controlled Gaza have been accompanied by an uptick of violence in the West Bank, where the Palestinians have limited self-rule.There have also been clashes between Israel’s Jewish and Arab communities in mixed areas.Israel’s president has warned that tension between Jewish and Arab Israelis could devolve into “civil war”.General strikes are planned for Tuesday in Arab towns within Israel and Palestinian towns in the West Bank, with posts on social media urging solidarity “from the sea to the river.” – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view uk election can things get better for labour","story":"Are the UK\u0027s Labour Party facing an existential crisis?

That is exactly how it should be. As an organisation funded by compulsory licence fee, the BBC must not allow its employees to “speak in their own voice” on controversial subjects. If they wish to speak out, that is perfectly understandable, but they must follow the logic of their position and leave the BBC. It is as simple as that. The fact that Mr Marr feels this frustration is a small sign that perhaps, under the new director-general, Tim Davie, the corporation is paying more than lip service to its key founding principle.As for Mr Marr, if he feels so unhappy, he should join us columnists in the Wild West world of opinion. It is much more fun than the Beeb and he would be a glittering addition to our number.The BBC still has a long way to go, however, along the road back to impartiality. Its coverage of the latest Israel-Palestinian confrontation and the anti-Israel protests in London at the weekend present a case in point. Here there is no overt opinion-mongering as, say, that of Emily Maitlis against Dominic Cummings. Instead, there is a way of framing the issue: Israel is in the dock and Palestinian violence is treated as almost incidental. The BBC’s Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, retweeted the headline of an article which read, “Racism, hate and violence are Jewish values too”. Bowen added: “Every Jew, and every gentile should read this.”During the weekend protests, a small convoy of cars carrying Palestinian flags was filmed driving through St John’s Wood in London. Their crew shouted obscene anti-Semitic abuse through a loudhailer, demanding that Jewish girls be raped.The BBC reported this, after it had been condemned by the Prime Minister. The reporting was calm which, even in such horrible cases, it should be. Imagine how different it would have been, though, if the men with the loudhailers had been white fascists, let alone if they had been shouting similar slogans against Muslim women. All hell would have broken loose. The BBC would have led its news with the incident, and thrown detachment to the winds. The BBC never explains what Hamas, Israel’s antagonist, believes. The Hamas Charter is explicitly anti-Semitic. It speaks of the “Nazism” of the Jews and says “the Day of Judgment will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews (and kill them) until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: 0 Muslim! there is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him!”Firing rockets from Gaza, which it controls, Hamas is working as hard as it can to kill Jews, telling Muslims that killing is their religious duty. Our media should explain that the foul-mouthed anti-Semites in St John’s Wood are not weird outliers: they are doing pretty much what their leaders tell them.People are a bit puzzled about what “levelling up” is. Given the desire of voters in places like Hartlepool for it to happen, urgent answers are needed.I think I have hit on one. Abolish the insistence on a university degree for any job in the public service, perhaps for any job at all. The professions will say they need people with well-trained minds to become doctors, barristers, investment bankers and top-grade civil servants. They do. But what makes them think they will necessarily find more such minds emerging from our bloated university system than from graduates of the “University of Life”, whom they could train themselves?Nowadays, policing and nursing are graduate professions, with the result that they disdain the bits the public most value and make entry from poorer areas harder. Even those wandering the richest “olive groves of academe” are not necessarily the better for it. Three years of anti-Brexit prejudice and “decolonising” curricula at Russell Group universities (plus debts of £30,000) may instil lasting bitterness and render alumni unfit for useful employment. Of course, people should go to university if they want to. But why should jobs be specially reserved for them?The Government is planning appropriate recognition for iniduals who have performed heroically in the Covid crisis once the “war” is over. That is right, but there is a case for collective recognition too.Consider the volunteers without whom the mass vaccination centres could not operate. As well as visiting for my own jabs, I have attended three other times with family or neighbours who need assistance, and witnessed the benefits. We, the public, have been put at ease by friendly volunteers (of most ages and both sexes) who register everyone and radiate the sense that they are doing a happy thing. They give a reassuringly local feeling to the place and let the doctors concentrate on the medical work unimpeded. As one GP puts it to me: “Apart from being helpful, they’re invisible.” He means that as high praise.The general good effect is what matters. Thousands – round us, roughly 20 per centre per day – are prepared to turn up unpaid, often in bad weather and with some small risk of infection, helping people who may be frail, frightened or confused.

Each time the Government needs to scare the public into submission, a new mutation pops up and chastens anyone considering reclaiming their pre-lockdown life.Last week, Boris Johnson warned that the Indian variant could mean some hard choices which might see the full release of lockdown pushed back beyond June 21.Undoubtedly, cases of this latest mutated virus are on the rise. It is now the dominant strain in some areas. Yet there is currently no evidence to suggest any of the variants will evade the vaccine programme, or that a new rise in cases will lead to an increase in hospital admissions or deaths.This pattern has now been playing out for several months, and curiously emerged just as the public was starting to seriously question apocalyptic modelling predictions stating that deaths would rise to 4,000 a day.It began in mid-December, when Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, told the Commons that more than 1,000 cases of the Kent variant had been found in 60 local authorities, largely in the south of England. It coincided with a spike in cases, with the variant quickly taking over from the Chinese wild-type which caused the first wave, leading Mr Johnson to cancel Christmas for many. By January, there was a countrywide lockdown. On Jan 4, the Prime Minister addressed the nation, warning that the variant was between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible.A few weeks later, on Jan 22, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u0027s chief scientific adviser, said the Kent variant could be up to 30 per cent more deadly and suggested it may kill 13 or 14 of every 1,000 men over the age of 60 who caught it, compared to 10 in 1,000 of the old variant.  Dire warnings from Public Health England around that time suggested the variant had caused us to soar past the peak of the first wave. Yet the second wave always seemed worse because it occurred during the winter, when many people would ordinarily be expected to die. In fact, despite this terrifying new deadly variant, second wave levels never reached the excess deaths of the first wave. It later emerged the Kent variant was no more deadly, and that the vaccines worked very well against it. King\u0027s College estimated it was probably about 35 per cent more infectious – far lower than the public was originally told.Cases peaked in Britain on Jan 4, a day before lockdown was imposed. But as the vaccine programme picked up pace and infections, admissions and deaths started to fall substantially, suddenly the public was informed about a new variant threat.On Jan 25, Mr Hancock announced that dozens of cases of the South African variant had been found on British soil, and the strain was now classed as a variant of concern.In the weeks running up to the Government announcing its roadmap out of lockdown on Feb 22, press conferences were heavily dominated by concerns over variants and people were told that staying at home and following social distancing was the best way to tackle their emergence.When the roadmap was announced, the Government added variants into its test of whether restrictions could be lifted, saying the release could only go ahead if our assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern. Being spooked by a variant was now grounds to withhold freedom.The week before schools and care homes were due back on March 9, Mr Hancock announced a third worrying variant, this time from Manaus in Brazil, which was thought to reinfect those who had already had Covid.So it was with a familiar sense of deja vu that the announcement of the latest release of restrictions on May 17 was accompanied by foreboding about the Indian variant. Again, we had warnings that it could be far more transmissible than even the Kent strain. It is now clear that neither the South African nor Brazilian variants ever achieved a large foothold in Britain, being consistently out-competed by the less deadly Kent strain.And there is currently no evidence to suggest the Indian variant is more lethal. In fact, Prof Sharon Peacock, of the University of Cambridge and Cog-UK which is monitoring variants for the Government, believes the current variant is outcompeting two other more dangerous versions from India. The vaccines have so far stood up to every variant thrown at them. The death rate for the Indian variant is far below the Kent variant, hospital admissions are not rising and the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed. This is despite one of the coldest springs for decades, which has forced people indoors.Cases largely appear to be rising in areas of vaccine hesitancy, suggesting people who are avoiding the jab are placing themselves and their communities at risk. This weekend, Mr Hancock suggested the majority of people in hospital with the variant had refused the vaccine.Can the rest of the county really be expected to forgo freedom because others have decided to not take the protection offered? More recently, there has clearly been a tension in the Government between the optimistic tone of the Health Secretary, who is confident that his vaccine rollout can save the day, and the Prime Minister and scientists, who seem oddly fatalistic that the jabs may fail. If they do, we are out of options. Variant booster jabs will not be ready for many months, and the country cannot stay in lockdown indefinitely.We will only be able to test out hard-won vaccine resilience by unlocking. Nearly 70 per cent of the adult population of Britain has had at least one vaccine dose, meaning we are now safer than at any time through the pandemic.  We should not still be cowering behind restrictions and the threat of variants. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"holidays europe covid vaccine passport","story":"British holidaymakers are on Wednesday set to be given the green light by the EU to use vaccine passports to enter Europe.EU ambassadors are expected to sign off a plan allowing fully-vaccinated Britons to fly to Europe without having to have a Covid test or quarantine.It came as the bosses of BA and Heathrow issued a joint plea to the Government to publish an advance list of its green countries for the summer to enable families to plan holidays.Currently, all European countries bar green-listed Portugal and Gibraltar are rated amber by the Government, requiring travellers to quarantine and take two PCR tests on their return.  The EU plan would see member states adopt uniform entry requirements, giving fully-vaccinated holidaymakers from low-risk countries such as the UK unrestricted entry to Spain, France, Italy and other popular destinations.It would, however, create a system that would see the rest of the bloc accept passengers based on vaccination status while the UK confers no such status on those who have had the jab and instead requires testing or quarantine for all returning holidaymakers.On Monday, thousands of Britons flew to Portugal on holiday as the Government\u0027s travel ban was lifted under step three of its roadmap out of lockdown.Other holidaymakers defied government warnings that they should not travel to amber countries by flying to destinations such as Greece despite having to quarantine on their return.Sean Doyle, the chief executive of BA, and John Holland-Kaye, his Heathrow counterpart, warned that Britain\u0027s restricted green list meant it risked missing out on the opening of travel across Europe despite the success of its vaccination programme.They said many European nations including Spain, Greece, Cyprus, France and Malta were making tremendous progress in bringing down infection rates and boosting vaccination levels.We are calling on the Government to help people to plan ahead by publishing a list of countries expected to be on the \u0027green list\u0027 for the summer so that passengers are not faced with high prices and limited choices for last-minute bookings, said Mr Holland-Kaye.That\u0027s happened to many people travelling to Portugal today. Let\u0027s give hard-working Brits the chance to get their towels on the sun lounger.On Wednesday, the UK is expected to be included on an expanded EU green list permitting holiday travel from non-EU countries with Covid infection rates below 100 cases per 100,000 of the population rather than the current 25 per 100,000.EU ambassadors will meet to agree a European Commission proposal calling for travel restrictions on non-EU countries with high vaccination rates to be lifted. If the ambassadors reach agreement as expected, the decision will be formally adopted at the EU trade ministers council on Thursday.The bloc\u0027s green list is currently limited to seven of the lowest-risk countries including Australia, New Zealand and Singapore – but the UK, with 44 cases per 100,000 people, and the US, at 35 per 100,000, are now expected to make the cut.Member states will also be recommended to set up digital portals that will enable Britons to use the NHS app as a vaccine passport as the EU develops a similar green certificate for citizens. Those who are not vaccinated will have to present a negative Covid test or evidence of immunity.Portugal and Greece have already jumped the gun by opening to British holidaymakers, but the EU-wide move is designed to kickstart the summer holiday season for the whole continent and agree a united position.On Monday, the Government faced a backlash from Tory MPs and travel bosses  over its tough approach, particularly to amber countries. Last week, Boris Johnson warned that the current 12 countries and territories on the green list would not expand very rapidly when the list is reviewed in three weeks.Matt Hancock reiterated that holidaymakers should avoid travel to amber countries other than for exceptional reasons, even though it is legal to do so under the traffic light system.But Huw Merriman, the Tory chairman of the Commons transport committee, accused the Health Secretary of effectively turning the \u0027amber list\u0027 into the \u0027red list\u0027 and added: What is the point in me having my passport any more?Mr Doyle said he was surprised by Mr Hancock\u0027s excessive warning, while Johan Lundgren, the easyJet chief executive, said the latest data suggested most of Europe could actually already from right now go on to that \u0027green list\u0027 of categories.Paul Charles, the chief executive of The PC Agency, who led a Save our Summer campaign, said: The Europeans are just more optimistic than the UK. They realise how critical travel and tourism is to their economies so they are moving at great speed to introduce a more seamless approach to travel for the summer season.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"indian variant surges two 20 per cent covid cases month","story":"In Blackburn, hospitalisations are stable, with eight people currently in hospital with Covid, and in Bolton 19 people are now in hospital with coronavirus, the majority of whom are eligible for a vaccine but haven\u0027t yet had a vaccine.This shows the new variant is not tending to penetrate into older, vaccinated groups and it underlines again the importance of getting the jab especially – but not only – amongst the vulnerable age groups.The lion\u0027s share of cases in both Bolton and Blackburn have so far been among the young – groups much less likely to have received either a first or second dose of a Covid vaccine.Across the country, there are now 86 local authorities with five or more confirmed cases of the new variant, the Health Secretary said. The next biggest case of concern is Bedford, where we are surging testing, and I would urge everybody in Bedford to exercise caution and engage in testing where it is available, he said.Mr Hancock said that while early evidence suggested B1617.2 was more transmissible than the previously dominant Kent variant, the extent was not known. Minutes published by Sage show that government scientists fear the Indian variant could be up to 50 per cent more transmissible than B.1.1.7, the Kent variant which has been the main strain in the UK since the the end of last year.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"period came back having coronavirus vaccine post menopausal","story":"Some post-menopausal women are suffering unexpected periods after receiving a dose of the coronavirus vaccine, scientists say.Researchers are investigating the reports to see if the disruption to the menstrual cycle is caused by the jabs.No proof has yet been found linking the inoculations to the unusual reproductive symptoms, but a growing body of anecdotal evidence has led scientists to begin probing the reports.Professor Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King’s College London, said earlier this month that the symptom-tracker app ZOE was monitoring reports of period-related side-effects.“At the moment there are just a few hundred of these, which given that we have over about 6,000 women who have been reporting, is a small number,” he said.“But we are taking it seriously and we are going to start asking more questions in the report.”More data was needed in order to determine if the link was real or “just a statistical quirk”, he said.Dr Kate Clancy, a medical anthropologist at the University of Illinois, wrote on Twitter about her own experience of unusually heavy blood flow after receiving the Moderna vaccine.She noted that less than two weeks after her first dose, her period arrived earlier than anticipated. Hundreds of women with similar tales shared their own sequence of events.Dr Clancy subsequently set up a survey dedicated to the issue to see if there is a scientifically robust relationship, but has yet to release any information on the findings.  Clinicians believe that even if there is a link between a person’s periods and a recent injection, it is unlikely to have any impact on fertility. Dr Victoria Male, a reproductive immunologist at Imperial College London, told the BBC that vaginal bleeding following vaccination was not unusual. She says the immune response to a vaccine, which is identical to when the body identifies a pathogen, causes myriad chemical signals to be produced and released into the bloodstream to fend off the foreign invader.The immune system also plays a significant role in the monthly curation of a womb lining in preparation for pregnancy. Under normal conditions, this lining sheds on a monthly basis if an egg fails to be fertilised. However, the extra chemicals produced following vaccination can disturb this process and result in premature shedding.Dr Male says this could be the mechanism behind the abnormal menstruation symptoms and it will not increase the risk of miscarriage.Dr Sue Ward, vice-president at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, told The : “We”re aware some women have been reporting a change to their period cycle or symptoms during the pandemic.“The degree to which changing hormone levels will affect someone is often informed by her psychological wellbeing at that time.“We know that life events can make PMS symptoms feel worse and something as all-consuming and life-changing as a global pandemic could result in women experiencing their periods differently.“Anecdotally some women are reporting heavier periods after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and we would support more data collection in this area.”The MHRA, the regulatory body responsible for assessing the safety of drugs and vaccines in the UK, monitors side-effects from the Covid-19 vaccines with its “Yellow Card” scheme.An MHRA spokesperson told The : “All Yellow Card reports of suspected side effects are evaluated, together with all other sources of evidence, by a team of safety experts to identify any new safety concerns.“The current evidence does not suggest an increased risk of menstrual irregularities following vaccination with a Covid-19 vaccine.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"simple health inequalities putting bame people getting vaccinations","story":"The figures may suggest that the issue is black and white.

The number of cases of the highly contagious new strain has quadrupled in the last  days, up to ,, across all age groups and right across the country. Almost  of these are in Bolton and Blackburn-with-Darwen in Lancashire, where the Indian iant is now the dominant strain. Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged those hesitant to look at Bolton - where the majority of people in hospital with the India iant were eligible to get the jab but hadnapost. Of the  hospitalised patients, some who are intensive care, five had had a single dose of the jab, one had had a second dose - and  had not been vaccinated at all. Another eight people are in hospital with the new strain in Blackburn. Mr Hancock told MPs: This shows the new iant is not tending to penetrate into older, vaccinated groups and it underlines again the importance of getting the jab especially - but not only - amongst the vulnerable age groups.He added: Vaccines save lives. They protect you, they protect your loved ones and they will help us all get out of this pandemic. The vaccine roll-out has been sped up and mass-testing has been introduced in aposhotspotsapos across the country, also including Glasgow and London, to try to curb the spread. But more than  local authorities in England are now reporting five or more confirmed cases, with Bedford the next biggest area of concern. The Government has been accused of dragging its feet on putting India on the travel aposred listapos because Boris Johnson wanted to travel there to strike a trade deal.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: Our borders have been as secure as a sieve. The delay in adding India to the red list surely now stands as a catastrophic misstep. People aged  will be offered the vaccine from tomorrow and this will be expanded down the age groups later in the week. Top Government scientists have warned against socialising indoors and hugging friends which could put Britainaposs final steps out of lockdown in jeopardy. They have urged people to be cautious as the nation unlocks amid fears the highly contagious Indian strain could trigger another big wave of Covid this autumn.  Millions of people across England are now able to mix inside pubs and restaurants, stay with friends and travel abroad on holidays for the first time since Christmas. In the clearest sign yet the final step out of Englandaposs roadmap on June  could be delayed, Boris Johnson dropped his deadline for major updates on social distancing, domestic vaccine passports and weddings. Just days after the Prime Minister promised them, No  confirmed it could no longer guarantee that the reviews would report back by the end of the month. Tory insiders admit that the final step out of lockdown - dubbed aposfreedom dayapos - could be delayedthe Indian iant spreads out of control. This would mean advice to work from home, social distancing rules and limits on indoor gatherings to just six people or two households would all stay in place. It also makes the imminent expansion of holiday destinations look less likely - with just  countries already on the travel aposgreen listapos and others unlikely to join theminfection rates soar. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted it was still very likely all restrictions will be able to end as planned in the roadmap. He added: People should have common sense, they should use judgement. If we act in a reasonable way, there is no reason to suppose that we canapost reopen the economy entirely on June . New data yesterday showed the B... strain - originally found in India - had more than doubled in the UK in a week to over , cases. Prof Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationsaid it was perfectly likely the PM will have to tear up plans for ending all restrictions from June . I really hope that the current concerns around this iant evaporate and that everything goes to plan, he said. But I think we just have to accept the possibility that we’re in for another big wave and we will have to change what we’re doing. He added that it was actually quite risky to mix people together at this point in time - and he had told his own family to be very careful about making contact. SAGE member Sir Jeremy Farrar said it was not unreasonable to press ahead with yesterdayaposs changes, but warned: This is the most dficult policy decision frankly in the last  months or so. It is very very finely balanced. He added that he would not be meeting family and friends indoors for the moment.  SAGE member Prof Graham Medley, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said he thought there was a less than % chance that the June  road map will be delayed. But he added: It is uncertain. Scientists have said that the vaccine remains effective against the Indian strain - but those who have not yet had the jab remain vulnerable. They have also confirmed that it is more infectious than the Kent strain which was dominant throughout the second wave. But No  has rejected calls by some local health chiefs to offer jabs to all over-s as they say it could take the vaccine away from needier recipients where. Currently only people in their late thirties, apart from frontline workers and those with underlying health conditions, have been offered the jab. In Bolton, local health chiefs admitted that other age-groups had come forward for the jab over the weekend. Dr Helen Wall, who is running the programme, said: We are looking for ways to vaccinate people rather than turn them away but we are sticking with the flexibility of the JCVI criteria.  People as young as  were said to have been able to get the jab, with young people living in multigenerational households among those fast-tracked. There were around , people in the area in the highest priority groups who were yet to be vaccinated last week, but , jabs were administered over the weekend. Sadiq Khan joined calls for a surge in Covid vaccinations to people of all ages in Indian iant hotspots.The London Mayor said the Government should use the vaccine sensibly and tackle transmission in pockets with high ratios of the iant. He has asked the Health Secretary to give flexibility to allow young people to get the vaccine early. But Downing Street urged health officials in England to stick to the priority list advised by experts - and not to extend vaccines to younger people. No  said: We want every part of the country to abide by the advice set out by the JCVI, itaposs this unied approach that has allowed us to proceed so quickly with our vaccine rollout. Glasgow residents aged - could be offered a first dose of a vaccine as soon as next week as Scottish health bosses try to stop the Indian iant from spreading across the city. Government scientic adviser Prof Peter Openshaw said it was important to vaccinate people as fast as possible including those under  in hotspot areas.Ex-PM Tony Blair added: There are some areas that will be bigger priorities than others.Itaposs probably sensible when you go into those areas not simply to vaccinate the risk population which is usually the more elderly population, but also to make sure that youaposre reaching the younger people as well who can spread it.NHS bosses have warned that low Covid vaccine uptake in Indian iant hotspot areas is the “biggest risk” to ato normal le.Second doses of jabs for over-s have are being brought forward so all will have received both at least two weeks before June .Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “The biggest risk comes from,there are large numbers of older people who are unvaccinated. He added: “The real issue is that we know that there are communities of people who haven’t been vaccinated and who are eligible - and we know there’s a link for example to deprivation, we know there’s a link to ethnicity.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnSadiq KhanBoris JohnsonJonathan AshworthConservative PartyNHSHospitalsMarriageThe economyPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"mps condemn deeply disturbing increase","story":"NewsMPs condemn deeply disturbing increase in anti-Semitism in recent daysCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was \"appalled\" by the abuse - and Labours Nick Thomas-Symonds condemned \"vile anti-Semitism and sickening, threatening misogyny\"mirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video convoy-cars-flying-palestine-flags-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:gvDDUuR,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was appalled by anti-Semitic abuse in recent days, which included a rabbi being attacked outside his synagogue in Essex and abuse heard being shouted by car passengers in areas with large Jewish populations in north London. And he threatened to “name and shame” councils and universities which refuse to sign up to The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism. Labour ’s Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: “What we saw and heard on the footage of the streets of London yesterday was vile anti-Semitism and sickening, threatening misogyny.Those who engage in this appalling, terrible behaviour should feel the full force of the law. Mr Jenrick told MPs the Community Security Trust, a charity providing security and advice to Jewish people in Britain, has reported a % increase of anti-Semitic incidents in the last week - with the figure likely to rise further due to a delay in reporting.  He later insisted that as a father of three young Jewish girls, he is absolutely committed to ensuring the British Jewish communities feel feel protected, feel safe and feel they can continue to thrive in this country. Mr Jenrick also vowed to name and shame councils and universities which refuse to sign up to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism, noting he has written to some organisations which are still dragging their feet. Conservative former minister Robert Halfon raised concerns over the weekend attacks, telling the Commons: As a proud British-Jewish MP, I never imagined that I would live at a time when myself and the Jewish community would question whether Britain is a safe place for Jews any more.  Matthew Offord, Conservative MP for Hendon, raised the case of a Jewish teacher being abused by pupils in the classroom. He added: In a comment echoed by , one constituent has told me that many people are asking the same question as before the  election, mainly is there a future for Jewish people in this country  Can the secretary of state please advise my constituentsthere is  Mr Jenrick replied: Yes, there certainly is and as the father of three young Jewish girls, I am absolutely committed to ensuring that the British Jewish community feel protected, feel safe and feel they can continue to thrive in this country. Earlier, Mr Jenrick had said: No-one could fail to be appalled by the disgraceful scenes of anti-Semitic abuse being directed at members of the Jewish community in the past week. In Chigwell, Rabbi Rafi Goodwin was hospitalised after being attacked outside his synagogue. In London, activists drove through Golders Green and Finchley, both areas with large Jewish populations, apparently shouting anti-Semitic abuse through a megaphone. These are intimidatory, racist and extremely serious crimes.  MPs heard four arrests had been in connection with the north London incident. Footage on social media showed a convoy of cars covered with Palestinian flags passing down Finchley Road, in north London, with passengers heard to shout offensive language and threats against Jews.The incident received cross-party criticism, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemning the acts as shameful racism that have no place in society.It came after thousands of people marched through London on Saturday to the gates of the Israeli embassy, while protests took place in other cities across the UK and Ireland in solidarity with the people of Palestine. Thousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee their homes after a week of sustained conflict. Since Monday night, Palestinian militant group Hamas has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, whose military responded by barraging the Gaza Strip with tank fire and air strikes. Mr Jenrick told the Commons: A lot of young, British Jews are discovering for the first time that their friends donapost understand anti-Semitism, canapost recognise it and donapost care that they are spreading it. They are not responsible for the actions of a Government thousands of miles away but are made to feel asthey are. Seeing their friends post social media content that glories Hamas, an illegal terrorist organisation - an organisation whose charter calls for every Jew in the world to be killed.

Mr Brake asked the ICO whether ... the Government has provided any justication for this proposed exemption. The ICO replied that it held no information. But they said: “We do not believe FOI and EIR legislation to be an obstacle to innovation and research because they already embed safeguards which allow a balance to be struck between the public interest in transparency and the protection of legitimate interests, where this is needed.”  They added: “Access to information is an essential component of a democratic society and our Outsourcing Oversight report clearly showed the risks to transparency and accountability when public information is removed from the scrutiny offered by access to information law.

We are seeing a recent increase in demand for our Cadbury  Flake in the UK and Ireland that we had not expected, Cadbury owner Mondelez said after confirming the shortage.The news has caused alarm on Twitter with some proposing contingency plans. Many have suggested alternative chocolate toppings that could be used to substitute the  Flake during the shortage. Only the UK and Ireland are thought to have been affected. Mondelez did not say how long it expected the shortage to last. However in a statement, the company said: The product is still available to order and weaposre continuing to work closely with our customers. The majority of the  Flakes sold in the UK are made in a factory in Egypt, with some also arriving from a facility in Coolock in Ireland. The term  Flake is often thought to indicate the price of the ice cream it accompanies but Cadbury says: The real reason for aposapos Flake being so called has been lost in the mists of time. But it points to one explanation suggesting the name takes its inspiration from the former Italian monarchy after a Cadbury sales manager witnessed ice cream makers - who were originally from Italy, but working in County Durham - cutting flakes in half and adding them to cones. In the days of the monarchy in Italy, the King has a specially chosen guard consisting of  men, and subsequently anything really special or first-class was known as aposapos - and that is how aposapos Flake came by its name, Cadbury said.  Another claim states that it originated from Portobello, Scotland, where Stefano Arcari who had opened a shop in  at  Portobello High Street. Arcari would break a large Flake in half and stick it in ice cream but the name came from the shopaposs address.  Elsewhere, another address-based claim for the beloved ice cream is made by the Dunkerleys in Gorton, Manchester, who operated a sweet shop at  Wellington Street. The report states that: The  is so-called in honour of the elite guard made up of  soldiers who traditionally protected Italian monarchs. The chocolate maker borrowed the number name to appeal to expat Italians who dominated the ice-cream business in Ireland and Britain at the time.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCadbury Ltd.FoodIce creamChocolate"},{"url":null,"title":"amazing lottery winner finds out","story":"AdvertorialAmazing!!!

Worryingly, doctors dismissed his symptoms as too much alcohol and sun. “He was dismissed as a typical British tourist and they didn’t take his symptoms seriously at all,” says his we Kelly, , a PA. “I was so upset and frustrated – I knew something had happened to him. “For  minutes Russ had been on the floor in our villa having a seizure. I knew it wasn’t just booze but they did a blood test and sent us home.” Back at the villa about five hours later, Russ had what the couple now know was a stroke. “He stood up and looked at me saying ‘It’s happening…’ but before he could finish his sentence, he keeled over.” What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Kelly called the ambulance again and this time the hospital performed a CT scan, which revealed a mass on his brain. The plant engineer was transferred to New General Hospital in Nicosia. “I burst into tears and felt so frightened, especially as we were away from home in another country where I didn’t speak the language and didn’t understand the health care system,” says Kelly. “It was also dficult to find out what was going on due to limited visiting hours due to Covid rules and the doctors didn’t make their rounds until after I left,” says Kelly. “I was terried and worried about the impact on the kids at home.” The couple went out on the weekend break in September.  “My mum had suggested that Russ and I went out to our villa for a long weekend when lockdown lted as we hadn’t any time to ourselves since we got married in May ,” says Kelly, , from Farnham, Surrey. “If only we’d known.” Two days after his seizure, Russ’s biopsy results revealed his tumour to be a low-gradeoligodendroglioma. The diagnosis meant the couple’s planned four-day trip turned into a six-week stay on the Mediterranean island and a painful separation from their children Casey, six, and Chloe, two, and Russ’s daughter Bethan, .  The devoted dad was frightened he wouldn’t make it through surgery. “He said to me. ‘WhatI never see my kids again ’’,’ says Kelly. Russ had surgery on October . “I was told it would take three to five hours but he was in theatre for over ,” says Kelly. “I was frantic with worry and it seemed like an eternity.”  Surgeons had removed the whole tumour which was .cm x cm deep and had developed close to his spinal cord, which was why the operation took so long. After a period of recovery, Russ was signed off as fit to travel and they ed home on November  to an emotional reunion with Casey and Chloe, who had been looked after by their grandparents. But their joy was short lived when Russ’s biopsy was re-tested and his tumour re-graded as grade  cancer, requiring  daily sessions of radiotherapy and then months of chemotherapy. “We were in shock and didn’t hear anything after the word ‘cancer’,” says Kelly. “It was such a shock for him and it affects the whole family.”  The couple are sharing their story to help The Brain Tumour Charity raise awareness and highlight the importance of its support services to help with the impact on emotional and mental health. “When we reached out to the charity’s support team, we didn’t feel so alone anymore,” Kelly adds. Eve Kelleher, The Brain Tumour Charity’s head of services, said: “Our hearts go out to Kelly and Russ. Being diagnosed with a brain tumour can be an extremely traumatic experience and it must have been so dficult to go through this ordeal while away from home.

I had blinding headache and a terrible cough. I have never felt so ill in my le. The cough was so fierce it was like I was turning inside out.I called my doctor and told him my bed was also soaked. He said I had Covid and needed to be in hospital, the Manchester Evening News reports.But Dena insisted on staying at home with just antibiotics.  I thought I was going to live but then  hours later it hit me again and I knew I had pleurisy [inflamed lungs]. Iaposm not afraid of dying - I have seen it many times. I got my will out. I thought: aposThis is it, I am going to dieapos. I left letters to my children and put them on the side of the bed so they could be seen. I said my prayers and went to sleep. I got the shock of my le when I woke up the next day. I was still here. God must have some terrible exit planned for me. Slowly Dena regained her strength and has ed her favourite pastime of tending her allotment in Oldham, Manchester.  Now, she finally felt safe enough to hug her family for the first time in over a year. She said: It was an amazing feeling. It was a wonderful, wonderful moment. It lasted a few minutes, and then a second hug, and then a third and a fourth. It was lovely holding those girls. She added: Even though my daughter Bonnie and I live in the same house we have been careful not to hug.  But the virus left its mark. Dena lost her brother, Joseph, in December who also fell victim to Covid-. He died on December th. He would have been  in March. He was the finest man I have ever had the privilege to know. He was such a Christian man. He ran a running club and an athletics club. Only a few of us could attend his funeral at a tiny church.  But all his running club friends lined up on the main road to applaud as his cortege passed. He has gone home to his God. His faith was impeccable. Like many of her generation, Dena, says she was brought up to be a tough nut. She explained: My generation are pretty tough bunch. As a child my brothers and I were brought up in countryside. My kid brother and I used to watch the air raids during the Second World War. I think it made you grow up fast. Unperturbed with her brush with death or the sad loss of her brother, sheaposs more keen than ever to live le to the fullest. I want to do a parachute jump for charity. I also may have to go to Austria, I have not visited there.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnWorld War FuneralsHospitalsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"fans joke mum 22 sue","story":"NewsFans joke mum-of- Sue Radford is planning another baby after huge jacuzzi postBritains biggest family the Radfords posted an image to their hundreds of thousand of Instagram followers of a large jacuzzi bath they were considering buyingmirrorShareCommentsByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  MAY NewsNoel and Sue Radford live in Lancashire with  of their  children \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It comes after the Duke of Sussex criticised his father last week, saying Charles suffered during his childhood, and “treated me the way he was treated”. Speaking about his upbringing as a royal, Harry told Dax Shepard his father passed on genetic pain and talked about how he wants to break that cycle. It is a far cry from the relationship the dad and son appeared to have when they chatted on BBC Radio aposs Today show back in . During that broadcast, Harry enthused: We could talk about this for hours and hours, which we always do, but not with a microphone in front of us.  I totally see it and I totally understand it because of all these years and conversations weaposve been having. I do end up picking your brains more now than I ever have done. The Prince of Wales referred to his son as dear boy, adding: Well darling boy it makes me very proud to think you understand. On his aposArmchair Expertapos podcast Harry appeared to have changed his tune. He said: When it comes to parenting,Iaposve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, Iaposm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I donapost pass it on.  Itaposs a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway, so we as parents should be doing the most we can to try and say aposyou know what, that happened to me, Iaposm going to make sure that doesnapost happen to youapos. Harry said that, as he grew older, he realised Charles was raising him in the same way he had been raised himself, and he wanted to change that for his own children. In a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year, the Duke of Sussex said there was a aposlot of hurtapos between him and his father. Their relationship reportedly soured to the extent Prince Charles had stopped taking his sonaposs calls following Harry and Meghanaposs decision to step away from royal duties.  Speaking to aposCharles  Harry: Father and Son Dividedapos producers, royal author Tom Quinn said: There is no doubt the gulf between Harry and Charles had widened considerably. I mean I thinkthey are not careful it will be very dficult to bridge that ide in future I canapost see how they can do it. Grant Harrold, ex-butler to Prince Charles, William and Harry also told the documentary: The damage is done.

Mary, , went missing on her way to catch a bus to visit her boyfriend Tim Merrett in Gloucester, in January , after a sht in the nearby Pop In cafe. Her disappearance has remained a mystery ever since although there has been much speculation over the years since that she could have been one of the West’s many victims. She had worked as a waitress at the cafe, now called Clean Plate, and West was a known customer. The Mirror revealed last week that his evil we Rose West was also seen in the cafe in Gloucester city centre as a teenager. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Although the wicked duo have always denied all knowledge of Mary Bastholm, whose body has never been found. But  years ago, decades before the West’s monstrous crimes were exposed, Mary’s devastated parents already knew their sweet daughter would have been taken by someone she knew. Asked about her disappearance two years after she vanished in  dad Christian said firmly: “It is rather dficult to say, but one thing I will always say is this – she did not go away on her own. “For a young girl like that to evade the police for so long well she’d have to be a master of the game wouldn’t she   “Personally I think she took a lt from someone she knew, this could have been someone perhaps who came into the cafe.” The only evidence ever found at the scene were some Monopoly pieces strewn on the ground as though there had been some kind of struggle at the bus stop. Sadly both dad Christian and mum Doreen died before they could find the truth about their daughter and agonisingly Mary’s brother Peter passed away just last summer. Mary’s mum Doreen and boyfriend, Tim Merret, are also featured in the footage, believed to be from local TV.  Mary was on her way to play Monopoly with Tim in nearby Hardwicke when she went missing. Poignantly he said he still “hoped’ she might turn up while her mother pleaded for her to get in touch. Last week Tim, now , said he has no doubt Fred killer Mary but doubts she is buried under the cafe. He said: “To me it doesn’t make sense that she is there but I would urge the police to keep looking for her.

So far forensic archaeologists have poured over the scene and have removed a fireplace in order to help their work. They are using geophysical survey equipment as part of exploratory work to see whether a full excavation of the cellar is required. Police are expected to give an update on the search on Tuesday morning and their plans for the site. They have so far defended the decision in  not to excavate the cafe, as there was “insufficient evidence” the teenager was buried there.

Rebecca Waterfall, , was working as a guest relations executive at the Principal Hotel in Manchester when she used the credit card of a man booking a hotel stay for himself and his we in . She fraudulently used his details to pay for a £, one-week stay at a premium holiday villa in the Spanish island of Menorca with her partner and child in October .Mum-of-two Waterfall also used the manaposs card to buy £ worth of shopping from Asda, and paid £ to a currency firm, Manchester Evening News reports.  She also bought a childaposs sun hat worth £., and a Minnie Mouse poncho towel for £. from Amazon. The victim had the money refunded. She previously defrauded a travel agent she worked for to the tune of £,. She used the money to offer friends discounted holidays to destinations including Cuba and Switzerland, and enjoyed a trip to Australia with her boyfriend. Waterfall, from Salford, had previously also pocketed £, which a family had paid her to go to Disney World in Florida.  They had to be pulled out of a check-in line by police at Manchester airport, after the crime committed by Waterfall, a family friend, was uncovered. The court heard she had paid the money back to the family, who had to repay to board the Florida-bound flight. After being arrested for the latest offence, Waterfall claimed it had been an accident, and she had no knowledge of the transactions. Waterfall initially received a suspended sentence in January  for the fraud committed while working for Cheshire-based travel agent Incentivise. At the Manchester Crown Court hearing on Monday, it emerged she was later jailed for nine months in January , after failing to comply with the suspended sentence. Now she has received a community order, after a judge said it would be wrong to jail her again. Judge Nicholas Dean QC said she would likely have received a longer sentence when her suspended sentence was activated,that judge had been aware of the most recent fraud. It seems to me it would be wrong now to send you to prison, and I am not going to do that, Judge Dean told her. The court was told that Waterfall has applied to enrol on a nursing apprenticeship. But the judge said he believed she may have made up the application. It is hard to resist the conclusion this has been made up to present a less worrying aspect of her personality to the court, Judge Dean said. Describing her as an intelligent young woman, the judge told Waterfall: You are prone to give way to greed and opportunistic dishonesty. You must learn to resist such temptationsthey are in front of you. Imposing the community order, the judge continued: With some doubts about the wisdom of this course, and as to whether you really have turned a corner, as the probation service seem convicted that you have, I am going to impose a  month community order. Waterfall admitted five counts of fraud.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCourt caseCredit cardsCrown court"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park. All the situations in the advert show the kind of fantastic projects those who play The National Lottery are helping to fund – from community sports to keeping our beaches clean and safe, bringing history to le in museums and helping people explore the great outdoors.By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week*.

The Labour MP was speaking on the BBC about the governmentaposs response to Covid- when his daughter, Annie, gate crashed the interview. Footage shows her making a surprise cameo appearance on the live stream of BBC News as she sneaks up on her dad. Exhilarating footage shows her cheekily waving at the camera with a big grin on her face while her dad smiles awkwardly as he tried to get her out. Mr Ashworth, who was talking about the Tory governmentaposs monstrous failure to give sick pay to those who had contracted Covid-, tries nudging her out when he realised he had been interrupted.  At that point the BBC presenter told the Leicester South MP: Well itaposs nice to see her, we are ruining her evening by keeping her dad up talking to on the telly. The MP laughs as he replies: “That is Annie and she’s very excited, she’s very excited because it’s been Leicester City day at school today and we’ve got Leicester City in the cup final tomorrow.” After a short while Annie reappears in the shot, swinging to the other side of her dadaposs chair as she keeps waving at the camera. Her dad laughs as he tries to get her out.  Annie finally leaves as the presenter can be heard saying: Thank you Annie, Bye.The hilarious video has racked up thousands of likes on Twitter, with many commenting on how humanising of a moment it was for the Labour politician.Itaposs not the first time Mr Ashworth is interrupted by one of his children during a live.  In April , his daughters zoom-bombed another interview with the BBC. He can be heard saying: Iaposm on the TV girls, Iaposm on the TV, as one of his daughters repeatedly shouts Dad!!Mr Ashworth instantly likened himself to Professor Robert Kelly, whose BBC live interview in  went viral when his two kids burst into the office and started acting up.

Many said they were simply very dferent but other sources believed there was a deeper issue and Meghan confirmed in her interview with Oprah Winfrey that one row ended in tears. While the two women only met in , as they were both celebrities itaposs unlikely that they didnapost know of each other before Harry started dating Meghan. In fact, an old photo has resurfaced that shows Meghan posing with a photo of Kate - years before they met.  In promo work for her role in Suits, Meghan posed with a cover of U Magazine which featured Kate on the front cover back in . However, in a glaring error the magazine states that Kate is pregnant with twins - when she was actually just awaiting the arrival of Princess Charlotte. Like any proud boyfriend, Harry couldnapost wait to introduce Meghan to his family and friends when their relationship started getting serious. Their long-distance relationship meant they had to wait a while for the introductions. In their engagement interview, Meghan described Kate as wonderful while Harry said his brother had been a fantastic support. Love reading about the royals for our daily newsletter with all the latest on the Queen, Kate, Meghan, William, Harry and the rest of the family - click here to register.  Asked what it was like introducing Meghan to his dad Prince Charles and William, he replied: What was it like  It was exciting I mean Iaposve - you know Iaposd been seeing her for a period of time when I - literally didnapost tell anybody at all. And then William was longing to meet her and so was Catherine. So, you know, being our neighbours we managed to get that in a couple of - well quite a few times now and Catherine has been absolutely. Meghan then cut in, adding: Sheaposs been wonderful.  Harry then continued: ...amazing, as has William as well, you know, fantastic support. And then my - my father as well, we had a couple of - no more than that. A handful of teas and meetings and all sorts of gatherings over at his place as well. So, no, the family together have been absolutely, you know, a solid support and my grandparents as well have been - have been wonderful throughout this whole process and theyaposve known for quite some time. So how they - how they havenapost told anybody is - is again a miracle in itself. But now the whole family have come together and have been a huge amount of support. However when Meghan sat down with Oprah to talk about her time in the royal family, it was a very dferent story. She explained her disappointment that she wasnapost allowed to correct media reports that she made Kate cry, claiming it was actually the other way around. She said it was a turning point in her time in the royal family and admitted she was hurt that the royals didnapost correct the story. After confirming that the narrative with Kate didnapost happen, she said The reverse happened. And I don’t say that to be disparaging to anyone, because it was a really hard week of the wedding. And she was upset about something, but she owned it, and she apologised. And she brought me flowers and a note, apologising. And she did what I would doI knew that I hurt someone, right, to just take accountability for it.  What was shocking was . . . what was that, six, seven months after our wedding  I would have never wanted that to come out about her ever, even though it had happened. I protected that from ever being out in the world. A few days before the wedding, she was upset about something pertaining — yes, the issue was correct — about flower-girl dresses, and it made me cry, and it really hurt my feelings. And I thought, in the context of everything  that was going on in those days leading to the wedding, that it didn’t make sense to not be just doing whatever everyone  was doing, which was trying to be supportive, knowing what was going on with my dad and whatnot. It wasn’t a confrontation, and I actually don’t think it’s fair to her to get into the details of that, because she apologised. What was hard to get over was being blamed for something that not only I didn’t do but that happened to me. And the people who were part of our wedding going to our comms team and saying, ‘I know this didn’t happen.’ I don’t have to tell them what actually happened.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMeghan MarkleKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince HarryRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Suzanne Stoakes was found by two of her children in the morning of May  not breathing.Kieran, , and Carys, , performed CPR on their mother at their Port Talbot home, but their efforts and those of paramedics were in vain, Wales Online reported. Oldest son Ashlee Roberts, , said the -year-oldaposs death has left a huge hole in their family as well as within the local community. On Friday night, May  she rang me and said she wasnapost feeling too good and that she was finding it dficult to catch her breath and said she was feeling anxious, Ashlee said. She wasnapost in pain and sounded like she was breathing fine. She went to bed that night and then in the morning, my younger sister called and said she needed me to come down and look at mam because she wasnapost well.  She was laying in bed and again said she was struggling to catch her breath. We called NHS direct and she spoke to a doctor on the phone for a while and he said that it might be anxiety and that they would put her on medication to help with that. She wasnapost in pain and had no other dficulties. Ashlee said his mum then started to get tired d told him she wanted a few hours to catch up on lost sleep from the night before. She said she would phone me later to let me know how she was, he said. I went home and then about half-an-hour later my sister rang to say she had stopped breathing and that an ambulance was on its way and that I needed to go back.  I got there within  minutes and the paramedics were there doing what they could. They told me my brotherhad been doing CPR himself and that it was something to be very proud of. Then they announcedand they werenapost sure what had caused it. They did a post-mortem and found that she had deep vein thrombosis which caused a blood clot in her lung some time over that night. Ashlee said it came as a total shock to him and his three siblings because Suzanne was healthy and active. He said the sudden nature of her death had made it particularity painful. It would have been her st birthday on June , Ashlee continued.  She was was physically fit, she had never driven in her le so she always walked everywhere and kept active. She lived near the beach so she often would walk theof the beach every couple of days and sometimes would ride her bike, so it really was a shock. He described his mother, who was a carer at Alma Lodge care home in Taibach, as being fun-loving, creative, but most of all very, very caring. He said: Sheaposs always loved caring for other people and always put people before herself.

Sheaposd walk an hour to work every day and do -hour shts, then stay on late overnight because she wouldnapost leave them there unless she knew they were comfortable.  A lot of people in the community knew her because of the care work she did.

She was really fun and very much the le and soul of the party. She had a lot of close friends through her job - one of her best friends, Zara, she met in work and she was about half her age - she was always so young at heart. The four of us had a really special sort of bond with our mum. She was our best friend and she would always be involvedus four got together as siblings.

The new tests have been compared to the PCR tests which are currently the gold standard when it comes to detecting the virus. At the moment, the quickest test in the UK you can get is a rapid flow test with results in  minutes, but experts have previously warned that these tests are not as accurate as the PCR kits. Everyone has access to these tests and you can get them posted to your home address or go to a test site.  You can get a PCR test which comes back with results in  hoursyou have the common coronavirus symptoms such as a new persistent cough, a high temperature and a loss of taste and smell. Now experts the US are saying a new test could rule out infection of both Covid- and the flu in just  minutes and they think the technology could also be adapted for other illnesses. The PCR tests look for specic genetic material which matches coronavirus whereas antigen tests look for protein on the surface of the virus.  The new -minute test from the University of Santa Cruz experts starts with a nose swab which is then examined with a fluorescent light. The probe will then light upit detects a specic virus. Experts created a new molecule which was coded to look for both Covid antigens and those that are present when someone has the flu, to develop the new tests. They say no extra equipment is needed as the molecule will shine bright enough so that someone administering the test can see.  The researchers have called the test “ultra sensitive” and claim that their test can identy flu and Covid proteins with a higher degree of accuracy than other similar tests. It has colour markers so that experts are able to tell whether or not a patient has flu or coronavirus. If a patient has Covid a red light will show, andthey have the flu a green light will be displayed.  The fact that the test can distinguish between the two viruses would be helpful during flu season as both illnesses share similar symptoms. Senior author of the study Holger Schmidt said: “This test could certainly be used in a central lab and provide high sensitivity and highly reliable antigen tests.” He added that administering the tests over the counter in a pharmacy could be a possibility.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEducationFluCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"people not getting covid vaccine","story":"NewsWhy are people not getting the Covid vaccine   key questions answeredAzeem Majeed, professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, answers eight key questions from why it is not safe to wait to just how rare blood clots aremirrorShareCommentsByMatt RoperFeatures writer:,  MAY NewsAnti-vaxxers and Covid conspiracy theorists harm themselves and others \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

I’d rather wait to seevaccines really are safe. What’s wrong with that  Covid- vaccines were tested extensively before they went into general use.  Subsequent data from their widespread use in the UK and other countries in many millions of people show that all the vaccines are very safe and that serious side effects are very rare. If you delay getting vaccinated, you are at risk of getting infected and also put at the risk the people you are in contact with. Other people need a vaccine more than me. Isn’t it OK to let others have theirs first   People are prioritised for vaccination based on factors such as age and medical history. When you receive your invitation to be vaccinated, you are not disadvantaging anyone . Aren’t people dying from blood clots because of the vaccine  Reports of serious blood clots are very rare, with typically only a few cases per million doses of vaccine administered.  I don’t trust the Government, so why should I trust a vaccine they tell us to have  Covid- vaccines were tested rigorously before they were used in the general population. No short cuts were taken in this testing. The safety of the vaccines continues to be assessed continually. The odds of me dying from Covid are so low I’d rather take the risk of not being vaccinated. Many people who survived a Covid- infection have been left with long-term complications such as heart and lung damage.  Vaccination reduces the risks of you suffering a serious illness, and also helps protect your elderly relatives and older work colleagues. Haven’t lots of people died after having their first Covid shot  Reports of people dying after their first Covid- vaccine are very rare. In most cases, death was due to natural causes and not linked to their vaccination. Can the Covid vaccine affect fertility  No, Covid- vaccines do not affect fertility. This vaccine was developed in record time. I’m worried they cut corners to get it out in such a rush. Vaccines were developed and tested in record time because of advances in medical technology in recent years and because bureaucratic obstacles to setting up research trials were minimised. No corners were cut in the development and testing processes. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. I’ve already had Covid so I don’t think I need a vaccine. Won’t I already have immunity  Natural immunity to Covid- can wear off and people can sometimes suffer a second infection. A vaccine boosts your immune response and gives you additional protection. Natural immunity to Covid- can wear off and people can sometimes suffer a second infection.

Anyone coming to the UK from an amber listed country, which includes Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Holland, as well as France and Greece, must quarantine for  days and have two PCR tests after two and then eight days.  As such, the UK has been criticised for being too cautious, despite the threat being posed by the Indian iant. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said tougher rules meant not only are Brits going to be beaten to the sun loungers by the Germans, Dutch and Swiss but this will leave them picking up a bigger bill for their holiday, coupled with an onerous, expensive and unnecessary testing regime for low-risk countries. We donapost want Britons to be left behind in the race to the sun when the huge success of our vaccination programme does mean travel can safely reopen, he added.  Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK, said: The UK will rapidly fall behind the rest of Europe unless it looks again at its overly cautious approach to international travel. There is no reason why our green list canapost be expanded to include the US and the most popular European hotspots, or for the UK not to follow the EUaposs lead in exempting vaccinated travellers from restrictions. There are fears that the B.. strain will hinder the UKaposs pandemic recovery and could lead to the final lting of restrictions on June  being postponed. As experts say vaccines have saved , lives, a surge in cases in Bolton threatens to scupper progress.

Itaposs in stark contrast to last yearaposs blistering sunshine that saw both the sunniest spring and driest May since records began. Met Office forecaster, Sarah Kent, said that changing climates make changeable conditions and weather extremes more likely. But she said it was too early to predictthis month will be the wettest May on record. Ms Kent said: Over the next few days, large parts of the UK will see showery conditions with occasional torrential downpours, thunderstorms and even hail. Drivers should be very careful as quite a bit of rainfall could lead to some problems on the roads. Iaposd say itaposs going to be very unsettled, as some areas will see some sunshine, and be relatively warm, while itaposll be chilly for those who see torrential rain. Parts of the country could see weather warnings imposed before heavy downpours and unseasonable gales move in from Thursday, the Met Office said. Those who are planning outdoor gatherings this week as coronavirus restrictions ease are being advised to think again due to signicant, windy weather as the result of a low pressure system over the UK.Temperatures in London and southern England will reach highs of C , while the mercury in Wales, Scotland and northern Ireland will hit C . However, a deep area of low pressure will hurtle in from the west on Thursday. Ms Kent added: Wednesday will be the most favourable day of the week, but will be a quiet lull before a potent low pressure system arrives from the Atlantic bringing with it unseasonably strong winds and severe gales.  Parts of the country could see weather warnings come in, as the winds and showers will hit large swathes of the country, particularly in western areas. Anyone planning outdoor gatherings should certainly keep an eye out for signicant, windy weather and be sure to monitor the Met Office website for any warnings. Five-day UK weather forecast Today: Starting mostly dry with sunny spells, but showers already in the southwest, developing more widely again, becoming heavy with risk of hail and thunder. Cloudy with rain or drizzle in the far north edging south into mainland Scotland.

Fiona Boswell, , tragically lost her groom, Guy Boswell, , in March to Cardiac Amyloidosis, which causes heart failure, after a battle with Non Hodgkins Lymphoma, a type of cancer. The pair, from Norwich, Norfolk, were due to be celebrate in a lavish ceremony at Elm Farm Country House in Horsham St Faith, in Norfolk, in July in front of  guests. Insurance underwriter Fiona, was forced to cancel the £, event when she lost Guy, a tiler, seven months after he was diagnosed with the disease. The couple quickly married with a special license in October before Guyaposs condition deteriorated but were hoping to celebrate their union with friends and family. What do you think  Have your say in comments below  Fiona said: We chose the venue as we had friends marry there and the day was lovely. It was also our first outing as a couple. When I let the venue know what had happened and asked for a refund, the response was just a straight no. Back and forth correspondence saw the venue had no compassion and were rude.  The impact from this on myself and my family has been huge. It has made me angry. It has also encouraged others to reach out to me who have had the same response from the same venue. The company only offered to sell the day for me, or I could sell it myself, when I advised them that I would be looking to ask a solicitor to get in touch with them. I told them how upset this had made me, selling my day that was supposed to be a happy day shared with my family and friends, a day I will never get to do with Guy. Fiona claims the venue wonapost refund the wedding because she cancelled too close to the planned date.  She said: I want these companies to look at the terms and conditions and add clauses to cover these unforeseen events or advise on wedding insurance. A wedding day is a day that most girls think of from a very early age, this venue, I would say, does not meet the definition of a fairy tale venue. The couple met four years ago in the bank where Fiona worked at the time and they quickly fell in love. Fiona said: Our relationship was perfect, we were soul mates.  He was the love of my le. We were both sad that we had not met earlier as young adults. I was so happy when Guy proposed. He got down on one knee after putting my ring in a champagne glass while we were with our friends in a pub. The impact of his loss has been huge on his family and I. We were told he would not see old age but did not expect it this quick. This was second marriage for us both and we loved each other. We did everything together. I feel like I have lost a limb, and that I will never have that love again. Friends of the couple have set up a GoFundMe page to help Fiona to replace the money spent on the venue.Click here to view it.

Meanwhile irritation and an itching or vague sensation of pain in the tongue, or less commonly mouth ulcers, could also point towards the virus. Dr GB Sattur treated a man, aged , who had extreme dryness of the mouth and conjunctivitis when being admitted to hospital, he told local media.Have you experienced any of the symptoms Dr Sattur has pinpointed  Let us know at webnews@mirror I had read that conjunctivitis can be one of the symptoms of Covid. Though he didn’t have a fever, he said that he was tired, the doctor added, with the man later testing positive for Covid. Dr Sattur advised anyone who has symptoms to do with the mouth, as well as severe general weakness, to go for a test. He speculated that the new symptoms may be due to the mutated strains, including those first identied in India, Brazil and South Africa.  “Doctors should keep an eye on tongue complaints and not ignore them, Dr Sattur said. The government must do more genome sequencing to understand the iants better.” A similar symptom referred to as aposCovid tongueapos has previously been described in the UK.Gabriel Scally, a public health physician and president of epidemiology and public health at Royal Society of Medicine, told The Sun: Symptoms in the mouth have been described for some time in association with Covid-.” Dr Satturaposs warnings come as lockdown lts in England to allow people to mix indoors, with pubs, restaurants and cafes finally reopening.

The despot is said to fear decadent Western influence on the countryaposs youth - amid fears it could cause his regime to crumble. Ripped and skinny jeans, and extravagant haircuts, are all viewed as signs of an invasion of capitalistic lestyle, it is claimed. Kim, who is believed to be increasingly anxious about being overthrown, has previously decreed that people found embracing outlandish fashions should be sent to labour camps. State newspaper The Rodong Sinmun, an organ of the secretive stateaposs ruling Workeraposs Party, launched a fresh appeal for such items to be kept at bay for fear of making the country collapse like a damp wall.  It wrote in an editorial at the weekend: History teaches us a crucial lesson that a country can become vulnerable and eventually collapse like a damp wall regardless of its economic and defense powerwe do not hold on to our own lestyle. It continued: We must be wary of even the slightest sign of the capitalistic lestyle and fight to get rid of them.According to Yonhap News Agency, the Kim regime has introduced stricter punishments for those found in possession of videos made in South Korea.Dyed hair and piercings are also not acceptable, reports claim.  Kim has outlawed non socialist hairstyles, with a very limited range of approved haircuts allowed, insiders have said. Earlier today it was reported that North Korea had withdrawn from the Asian Qualiers for the  World Cup. The move was announced by the Asian Football Confederation . North Korea had won two of their five matches and were fourth place in Group H, which also consists of Turkmenistan, South Korea, Lebanon and Sri Lanka. They were scheduled to next play Sri Lanka on June  at Goyang Stadium in South Korea, with all the remaining group matches held at centralised venues due to the pandemic.  The AFC said the Organising Committee for FIFA Competitions will now investigate the matter, with details on how North Koreaaposs exit affects the standings to be announced in due course. North Korea is believed by analysts to already have more than  nukes, although the delivery vehicles are still being developed.US President Joe Biden has said nuclear programmes in North Korea are a serious threat to Americaaposs security and world security.He recently told Congress they would be addressed with “diplomacy and stern deterrence”.

Suzy Eshkuntana woke up alone in Gaza’s largest medical facility after being rescued from the rubble left by the attack that tragically killed her mum and four siblings, it was revealed on Monday. She was then reunited in Sha hospital with her father, Riyad, who was also being treated for his wounds. He immediately begged his daughter’s forgiveness for having been unable to free her himself. Riyad told her: “Forgive me You screamed to me to come to you, but I couldn’t come.” What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  It came as families in Gaza were on Monday counting the cost of the most devastating onslaught so far. Waves of Israeli attacks took the death toll to at least , with  children known to be among the dead. Some , people have so far been injured in the Palestinian territory. As many as ten Israelis have been killed and  wounded as the Jewish state has came under rocket attacks.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had already vowed the campaign against Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants based in Gaza will continue with “full force,” adding it “would take time to finish.” And as many as  Israeli jets bombed  targets in just  minutes on Monday. Among those killed in the devastating barrage was a top Islamic Jihad leader, Hussam Abu Harbeed. Israel claims that a record , rockets had been fired into its own towns and cities from Gaza in the past week.  In a statement confirming it had killed Harbeed, the Israeli military said he “was behind several anti-tank missile terror attacks against Israeli civilians.” Chiefs said that those attacks included one on the first day of the current round of fighting, which they said had injured a civilian in Israel. Harbeed had been a commander with Islamic Jihad for  years, it said. Downing Street said it was seeking answers from Israel about other attacks which destroyed a building housing the Associated Press and other media outlets in Gaza. Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman said: “We are deeply concerned by UN reports that more than  schools and  homes as well as medical facilities and media offices have been destroyed or seriously damaged.”The aerial bombardment began after Hamas rockets were fired at the cities of Beersheba and Ashkelon. One of those missiles slammed into a synagogue hours before evening services for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, local emergency services said.  No injuries were reported following the incident. Israeli aircraft then launched their own raids, with the Israel Defence Forces saying nine residences belonging to high-ranking Hamas commanders had been hit. It was claimed some of the homes were being used to store weapons caches.  Gaza’s people say the horror they are experiencing is worse than ever. Samir al-Khatib, an emergency worker, said: “I have not seen this level of destruction through my  years of work. “Not even in the  war.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBenjamin NetanyahuBoris JohnsonUnited NationsHamasIslamic JihadPoliticsMiddle EastMiddle East"},{"url":null,"title":"russia constantly tracking british patrol","story":"NewsRussia is constantly tracking British patrol ship as it heads to UkraineThe Royal Navy offshore patrol vessel posed “no serious threat” to the Russians, insisted former Black Sea Fleet commander Admiral Vladimir Komoyedov, as a video showed its arrivalmirrorShareCommentsByWill StewartWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  MAY NewsIt comes amid tensions with Ukraine \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

HMS Trent sailed through the Dardanelles and Bosporus on Sunday amid tensions over the Kremlin’s intentions in eastern Ukraine. The Royal Navy offshore patrol vessel posed “no serious threat” to the Russians, insisted former Black Sea Fleet commander Admiral Vladimir Komoyedov, as a video showed its arrival, despite the announcement that its every move would be watched. I would not even say that the British [navy] would be able to tickle our nerves,” he told Interfax. “Maybe, only the heel, a little.” He said the vessel would be constantly monitored in the Black Sea where it can remain for up to  days under international agreements.  “If a serious ship enters the Black Sea, and there is an immediate threat, then you can track it with weapons, as target designations are issued to coastal missile systems and aircraft, which are on duty, said Admiral Komoyedov. The Russian National Defence Control Centre confirmed it was watching the Royal Navy vessel. The forces of the Black Sea Fleet have started tracking the actions of the British Navy patrol ship HMS Trent, which entered the Black Sea on  May ,” said a statement. Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, former chief of the Russian naval staff, said the Trent would be “met” near the Bosporus Strait and monitored using “radio equipment”, according to Interfax. “Ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet are constantly nearby until foreign naval ships leave the area,” said the news agency report citing Kravchencko.  “Of course, this is unpleasant. You will have to be distracted, keep an eye on them what are they going to do in the Black Sea, said Kravchenko. Last month there were reports that Britain would in May send to the Black Sea a Type  destroyer armed with anti-aircraft missiles and an anti-submarine Type  frigate. It was reported that RAF F-B Lightning stealth jets and Merlin submarine-hunting helicopters will stand ready on the Mediterranean task groupaposs flagship, HMS Queen Elizabeth. The Gibraltar-based HMS Trent’s arrival follows the US Coast Guard patrol ship Hamilton in the Black Sea. In recent days, the Russians also said they were tracking French Navy patrol vessel Commandant Birot. Over three days the Russian military said its fighter jets were scrambled to shadow French Air Force aircraft over the Black Sea. Russia has pulled back some troops that massed on Ukraine’s borders last month. But there is still concern in the West over Vladimir Putin’s intentions in Ukraine and considerable forces and equipment remain.

opening day thumping at Hearts as motivation to get them to within touching distance of the Premiership.Club captain Charlie Adam made his league debut for his boyhood club that night at Tynecastle but, despite scoring a superb goal, couldn’t prevent a crushing defeat by the eventual league champions.However, he has revealed his pride in the team at Dens Park after putting a “sticky” patch behind them earlier in the season to move to within two matches of promotion.They will face Kilmarnock in the two-legged final over the next week after seeing off Raith Rovers in the semi with a - aggregate victory.“I am just really proud of where we have come from,” he said.“We had a sticky part at the start of the season and used that first-day defeat to Hearts to try and motivate us to get into this position.“We are two games away from the Premiership and it is going to be exciting.”He added: “To get through these next two games is going to take some hard graft, a bit of luck and some quality.“If we turn up on our day then we will give ourselves a chance.“There is a lot at stake. It has been a long time since the club was in the Premiership.“Look at the Premiership next season, there are a lot of good clubs and there will be big games.“Rangers have won the league by  points but they are going to need to improve again.“Celtic and Aberdeen will be under new management, Jack Ross has done well at Hibs and across the road there is another derby for us.“But this final is going to be tough.“We have to use the experience from Wednesday and Saturday that no matter what score it is it is never over.“In the end, it was a battling performance.“We are delighted to be in the final.”They booked that final place with a - aggregate victory over Raith Rovers in the semi-final.An impressive - victory at Stark’s Park in the first leg was followed by that “battling performance” at Dens Park on Saturday night.Though that finished in a - defeat and ended their nine-match unbeaten run in the league, Adam says the good mood around Dundee won’t be affected.“Defeat only resets you a wee bit” he said.“We will be playing a good team but we are also a good team.“We have been in good form.“You don’t want to get beat but it happens.“We will look over it and we will be prepared and ready to go Thursday and Monday.”Of Saturday night#s game, he added: “It is easy to say now that it was won after the first-leg.“We were excellent in the first game and in the second leg we never got going but we still created enough to win the game.“It was a dficult result. We were - up and suddenly they got one and there was a bit of pressure.“The run of form we went on to get to second place was great.“We are going into the play-off games confident.“If we turn up in the two games then we will be in the Premiership.“We are excited and looking forward to it.”The big pressure is often thought to be on the Premiership side in these play-off finals.However, Adam rejects that and insists there will be more than enough expectation on Dundee as they look to end their time in the second tier.“There is a pressure on us,# he said.“We are a big club and there is a pressure on us to get back to the Premiership. | SPFL\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed CEIsUMmg featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen“The pressure and onus and expectation as a football club to get back to the Premiership is there.“We are excited about it and the boys in our dressing-room will relish that challenge.“We have a good group of players. There is pressure on both teams and we will be confident.” Dundee analysis: Dee hearts aflutter but Dark Blues have earned their shot at a Premiership \" title\"#Dundee analysis: Dee hearts aflutter but Dark Blues have earned their shot at a Premiership # # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundee-analysis-dee-hearts-aflutter-but-dark-blues-have-earned-their-shot-at-a-premiership- embed # secretCeaPGcAN\" data-secret\"CeaPGcAN\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/FIRE-Grenfell-064308_22347252-279x372.jpg ","title":"cladding used in grenfell tower flats to be removed from dundee school four years after discovery","story":"Grenfell Tower cladding covering a Dundee school is finally set to be removed this summer – four years after the potentially harmful insulation was first highlighted.Almost a quarter of the cladding on the external walls of St Paul’s Academy is constructed of Reynobond PE, which was also found in the exterior  of the London block which went up in flames in June .The cladding is used at the school as an elevation treatment between upper windows and roof levels to % of the building elevation.City council chiefs were first notied of the material a month after the tragic blaze which claimed the lives of at least  people.A freedom of information request we submitted to Dundee City Council revealed the material still encases the Kirkton school.However this will be the final year pupils will be present in the school with the cladding as the removal has been scheduled to take place during the summer holidays.A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “Work to replace the cladding will now take place during the summer months.”However concerns have been raised over why it has taken so long to remove the potentially dangerous insulation.Local councillors were first asked to approve a £, financial contribution towards the removal of the insulation in November , and it was expected to be removed the following summer.Almost four years after its discovery, the material is still part of the cladding wrapped around the city school.The safety of pupils and staff should be of the utmost concern.#Michael MarraWhen probed, the local authority said “logistical” problems had caused the original delays which had then been exacerbated by the Covid- pandemic and subsequent lockdowns.North East MSP Michael Marra, who is also Scottish Labour’s education spokesman, said: “This material was identied four years ago. Money was approved by councillors two and a half years ago.“A date for this work should be set immediately and the works undertaken as soon as possible.“The safety of pupils and staff should be of the utmost concern. There should be no further delays.”The aluminium composite materialknown as Reynobond meets current Scottish building standards, it is understood.However the UK Government may be considering a ban on this type of cladding in the future.It is made from polyethylene plastic sandwiched between two very thin sheets of aluminium and was sold by French-based firm Arconic Architectural Products.The  were installed on the sides of the Grenfell Tower flats – and on building projects across the world – to make it warmer and drier.But this type of cladding is considered highly flammable.The local authority committed to removing the insulation at St Paul’s following a devastating blaze at city school Braeview Academy in September .It was part of the council’s efforts to increase safety after a number of failures – which may have limited fire damage – were highlighted months before.The recommendations went unresolved by the time the flames engulfed the school, and we revealed that more than two years later, the school was still considered a “substantial” fire risk.Following the Grenfell blaze, an investigation by the Scottish Government found that schools in  local authorities were clad in Aluminium Composite Material , however it was not disclosed which schools were affected.St Paul’s is the only city school to be clad in the harmful material.As part of a series of freedom of information requests, the four local authority areas in Tayside and Fe were asked to confirm which schools used the aluminium composite materials.This could include other ACM insulation or the same materials used in the Grenfell Tower block.In Angus, while no school is entirely clad in these materials, two schools have small areas of ACM cladding.Just .% of the , square metre external wall of Timmergreens Primary in Arbroath uses a polyethylene cored insulation known as Alucobond, however this material was not used in the Grenfell flats.Warddykes Primary, also in Arbroath, has .% of its , square metre wall area clad with Alucobond.In both cases, the council says the  system meets Class O requirement in accordance with the Scottish Building Regulations and both schools have regularly serviced sprinkler and fire alarm systems.Fe Council and Perth and Kinross Council said the Grenfell cladding is not used in any of their school buildings."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-milton-couples-love-lasted-lifetime","story":"A PICTURE paints a thousand words, the old saying goes."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"louisa-jordan-katherine-watt---great-glasgow-nurses-celebrated-international-nurses-day","story":"WE all have a reason to be grateful for nurses and today is all about a celebration in their honour."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

step towards normality, film buffs in the Granite City were #absolutely ecstatic# to once again hit the cinema and enjoy their favourite moving pictures on the big screen.Nearly five months after entertainment venues were forced shut due to the implemented lockdown restrictions, a number of businesses have finally been given the go-ahead to reopen.These include cinemas, amusement arcades and even bowling alleys.Dozens of people flocked to Vue Aberdeen on Monday morning to share the #one-of-a-kind# cinema experience  # the gasps, shrieks and belly laughs # with family and friends.Three years# worth of new releases will be coming to the big screen over the next  months, including Peter Rabbit: The Runaway, A Quiet Place , Top Gun: Maverick, Minions: The Rise of Gru and Fast # Furious .Allan Clark was one of the first to rush through the doors with his four-year-old daughter Kacie to see the new adventures of Peter Rabbit.The -year-old said: #We booked on Friday, because we knew it was coming, and it#s just good to have some normality back # to spend time together as a family again and have this kind of experience.#Robert Gordon University student Connor Faulkner was also eager to finally get together with his friends for a long-awaited cinema visit.The -year-old explained how this kind of experience has no match.#I enjoy seeing the big screen and the kind of a hide-away, and the cinema has always been a sort of a comfort zone for me#, Mr Faulkner said.#I was devastated, when all of that got taken away during the pandemic, so I#m really excited to be back.#Literally, as soon as they announced that cinemas will be reopening on May , I checked all the venues and booked a ticket.#Mr Faulkner#s friend, -year-old Jonathan Debris, added: #It’s so nice to be back, but mostly, it#s great to just hang out with my friends again and do something dferent than just sit in the park.Ryan Greig, , and Eilidh Dorward, , were among the customers, who couldn#t wait to grab a box of popcorn and see the all-time classic Lord of the Rings on the big screen.Ms Dorward said: #Being able to see films on the big screen is one-of-a-kind experience that just can#t compare to watching films at home and we are just so happy that it has opened again.#We#ve really missed coming to the cinema and it#s just great to be back.#A range of special measures have been introduced at Vue Aberdeen to ensure the safety of all visitors and staff.As soon as they come through the doors, customers are asked to register on the cinema#s Track and Trace system before heading to the counter for snacks and tickets.A new queuing system, social distancing markers and hand sanitisers have also been put in place in the foyer and along the hallways to help customers get to their screen as safe as possible.General manager Andrew Dykes said: #We are ecstatic to finally reopen after over six months of waiting.#We’ve had quite a lot of people on the first day already # a lot more than what we expected # and it#s been very good to welcome some of our regular customers and also see some new faces.#We have three years# worth of films coming out in the next few months, so our programme is looking very strong at the moment.#One film that most people have been long anticipating is James Bond: No Time To Die, which is finally coming out on September , along with many other new releases down the pipeline.#It’s fantastic and we are all very excited.#COMING SOON: Seven of the best independent cinemas in the north and north-east for the ultimate big screen experience\" title\"#COMING

re-elected as First Minister of Scotland today at a special vote in parliament.Despite Ms Sturgeon holding the position since  and being the leader of the biggest party in Holyrood, she does not automatically stay in the top job.MSPs will be asked to put forward their nominations before .pm.Under the Scotland Act, the first minister must be elected within  days of the Scottish Parliament election –not, a whole new election will need to be held.All nominations for the position of first minister must be proposed by at least one MSP, and then seconded by at least one other for them to officially count.Each nominee is given five minutes to speak in the debating chamber to convince the other MSPs to give them their vote.If a candidate wins more votes than the total number received by all other candidates, and the total number of votes cast is more than a quarter of the total number of seats in the parliament , that candidate will be elected.If there are more than two candidates up for the position, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated in each round of voting.Howeverthere is only one candidate, members will simply be asked to vote for or against that person, and they just need a majority to be declared the winner.Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, has said he will stand against Nicola Sturgeon for first minister.He previously stood against Ms Sturgeon in , but was defeated after winning five votes to Ms Sturgeon’s .Mr Rennie, who represents North East Fe, said: “In a parliament of minorities it is important that there is a challenge.“This should not just be a SNP cakewalk.“Nicola Sturgeon and Douglas Ross are both obstacles on the path to tackling the issues that really matter.“They both want to spend the next five years arguing over independence.“As first minister I would focus on education, mental health, jobs and the climate emergency.“That’s a positive plan for Scotland.“That’s how we put recovery first.”The decision to oppose is often just a symbolic move in order to give an opposition member time to speak.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day. This figure shows all tests carried out, regardless of the result.In October, Public Health Scotland released testing data at a regional level.

An R-value of three would mean the average person with Covid- would go on to infect another three people. As Covid- death recording is so complex, a more reliable measure is excess deaths. Excess deaths are the dference between the total recorded deaths by all causes and the average of the previous five years. The chart below shows this for the UK constituent countries.

at Curl Aberdeen.Mouat said: “We started pretty fast and managed to get a good lead, - after four ends.“From there it felt like we were controlling the game and got on top of the ice so it was a great start.“It is nice to be in an environment where we know what Aberdeen is going to be like.“Obviously it is a shame that we cannot have any crowd here because it would be amazing to have family and friends watching.“Maybe another opportunity for that will come our way down the line, but for now we are happy to be here and happy to be playing.”Dodds was pleased to make her debut in the tournament.She and Mouat won the Scottish title last year, but the pandemic meant the World Mixed Championships didn’t take place in .Dodds said: “I feel like it was a long time coming, so I was a bit nervous going into the first game.“But once you have had practice and you have thrown your first stone at the first end you kind of settle in quite easily.“So it was a good to get going and we are glad to get that first win on the board.”Dodds and Mouat started strongly picking up doubles in ends two and three to establish a - lead, with a single in the next adding to the advantage.In the fth end Italy struck back and picked up two shots, but a double from the Scots in the next was enough to secure victory with Italy only picking up one in end seven before throwing in the towel.As well as trying to win a World Championship medal Dodds and Mouat are hoping to secure a spot for Great Britain in the mixed doubles event at next year’s Winter Olympics in Beijing.To do that they need to finish in the top seven this week.Elsewhere at Curl Aberdeen the Czech Republic beat Australia -, Canada beat Spain -, Germany prevailed -

Thursday night is shinty night in Lochgilphead, with the club holding primary school age coaching from pm to pm and combined men#s and women#s training from pm to .pm.The practicalities of travelling to away matches under Covid rules do, however, give cause for concern. #We can#t use a minibus as things stand and will have to use inidual cars for a -strong squad,# said Angus.#With seven players under  years of age in the squad, we will have to rely on the support of parents.#Kilmory has been placed in the Mowi South A regional league alongside Bute, Lochside, Taynuilt, Ballachulish and Inveraray second team.#There is tough competition in the league,# said Angus, #so with the number of young players we have it will be a case of getting the best team we can on the pitch every week, learning against good opposition and building for the future.#Inveraray#s first team will compete in Mowi Senior League C with Aberdour, Glasgow Mid Argyll, Kyles Athletic, Oban Camanachd and Oban Celtic.Inveraray players were non-contact training twice a week as soon as the rules allowed and club chairman Andrew McMurdo is pleased with their attitude. #I didn#t know what to expect, but the boys have been great and conscientious about the way they go about it. And socially it#s been good for them,# he said.#Both first and second teams are in challenging leagues, but it#s a good challenge. And with no relegation, we can experiment a bit and plan for next season.#Like every other aspect of le, shinty has had to be flexible and adapt to the pandemic, so hats off to the Camanachd Association for having the plans in place and implementing them so quickly.#New volunteers at Kilmory and Inveraray shinty clubs would also be welcome, particularly with the additional burden of meeting Covid requirements.Andrew McMurdo said: #No matter how big or small the task, more hands lighten the load, so we would appreciate the help of new volunteers.#PICS:Inveraray’s Andrew Fraser in yellow and black during a friendly match with Glasgow Mid Argyll in February  # one of the last matches before lockdown.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter a land of sustainability","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement.

Two other events earmarked for funding, Inveraray Highland Games and Tiree Music Festival, have already been cancelled altogether.Applications for the latest phase of the fund closed in December , with a decision having been delayed by the policy and resources committee in February due to the continuing uncertainty over gatherings.In a report, executive director Kirsty Flanagan said: #Whilst there is still uncertainty and unpredictability it is hoped that events will be able to go ahead at some point later in the year.#It is therefore felt important to support our events industry as much as we can by awarding grants to those strategic events that hopefully still have a chance of going ahead either because of their nature or the fact that they are due to be held later in the year.#Members are therefore being asked to award in principle eight SEF grants currently totalling £,.

The fact that five events have already advised of their cancellation further reinforces the uncertainty facing event organisers.#It should be noted that the organisation of one of these events, Cowal Highland Gathering, which would normally take place over a weekend, is still considering holding a one-day live music mini festival event and a sum has been allocated should this prove feasible.#This is the same for Jura Music Festival event and Dunoon Multi Sports event organisation, both of which may hold a more localised event.#The loss of any event from the local economy is signicant, and for a number of our strategic events this has now happened over two consecutive years.#This means that both for those events that do manage to go ahead this year, but especially those that do not, the £, SEF round four funding for  , agreed at the February  budget meeting, will be even more important funding support when all events are in a position to go ahead.#"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 14 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"new crop of msps welcomed","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So, throw open your windows, stock up on blossom-scented cleaning supplies and follow my steps for freshening up your home for spring hellipDeep clean and declutter:Spring is the perfect time to assess your home and see what you can donate or throw out. Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That much is obvious from her work at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, as well as performances in bands including Rhuvaal, one of Scotland#s fastest rising young traditional groups.It is moving that Alex chose to use that talent not only to pay tribute to Robert Black, someone who inspired her passion, but to raise money to help with the costs of operating the helipad named in his memory.We#re sure it#s not the last we#ll hear about Alex#s career in music.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The one on the shore has been there for more than a year, but the caravan on the high road has been left there as no-one overlooks that spot.#A spokesperson for Argyll and Bute Council said: #We remove anything on council property andany of the areas identied are private land it is the responsibility of the owner or occupier to act.#We will make sure they are notied, work with them to have items removed and do what we can to identy the offender.#The fixed penalty notice for fly tipping is £.

The land to the west is within the settlement boundary but has no housing allocation.#It is therefore not deemed there will be neighbouring amenity issues regarding the proposal.#The northerly elevation will have gable height glazing to the living room and the mezzanine void space. The bedroom en-suite and office is served by rooflights.#There will be a porch to the west for utility reasons which will have a sloping roof to the eaves. The main roof is to be traditional slate with the walls re-using the stone. There is a single door on the easterly elevation and a chimney for the stove on that roof elevation.#A condition will be attached to any approval regarding the materials to be used. The design maintains the vernacular of the former byre and is deemed to be sympathetic to the main house and its setting as a listed building.#The officer added: #According to Scottish Water, there is no public waste water infrastructure within the vicinity of this proposed development and therefore advise the applicant to investigate private treatment options. The proposal can be fed from the Port Charlotte water works.#The council#s roads department highlights that the use of the existing private access to main road is acceptable.#The proposal is deemed to be an acceptable repurposing of an appropriate vacant building within an existing community and using existing infrastructure. It is also consistent with the council#s aim to reverse static or falling populations in a smaller rural community.#"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

I am grateful to the Courier reviewer and to the other reviewers in the BBC, ITV and papers from Stornoway to London for giving it such a good start.#My advice to young authors  Stick at it. The first  books are the worst!#His latest book for children, Super Nova and the Frozen Man, is also doing well in hard cover and paperback. Most of Angus#s books are published in European countries, and some in America, but only the other day he heard this one is being published in Japan.#I#d rather have heard that my golf handicap is coming down, but that would be even more of a miracle.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOPlease noteThe change in the publishing day of the Courier to Thursday of each week instead of Friday has proved so acceptable to readers, particularly to the large number resident outside the district, that we have resolved to make the arrangement a permanent one.Sparks and flashesA meeting will be held in the Town Hall on Friday evening with the object of forming a branch of An Comunn Gàidhealach in Campbeltown.Neil M#Bain is among the latest of the Ayr United Football Club players to fix up for another season.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"new inspector looks learns and loves argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I#m taking everything and everyone at face value.#Though fresh to the job and area,  Inspector Collins won#t be charging in with his new broom.#I#m wary of coming in and trying to revolutionise everything,# he said.#There#s no way I know more than the folk who have worked here for #X# amount of years.#But that#s not to say that I won#t have ideas and plans going forward. Any plans I do have, though, will need to be linked to what I#m hearing from local people, both residents and police officers.#As he looks, listens and learns, he emphasised the importance of the bond between the police and local communities.#That working partnership is important,# he said. #They need us, but we need the community as well.#I come from a community policing background, and I do care about what I do # in a tight community people will soon knowI don#t care.#I want our officers to be out there and visible, and in order for me to fix things I need the community to tell me what the problems are.#Coming into the job during a pandemic, Inspector Collins sees the police role as supporting people as lockdown restrictions begin to ease.#As traffic begins to pick up and there are more people around I believe we should be there to look after people in the community and help them to adjust to lots of folk coming in.#For visitors, we need to adopt an education stance because those leaving litter behind, lighting fires and the rest of it are often doing it from a standpoint of ignorance.#I want people to come and visit Argyll and enjoy it, but more importantly the people who live here have to be foremost in everything we do.#The geography of Argyll is on a dferent scale to that seen in Lanarkshire, and the inspector admitted he was adjusting to this aspect of rural policing. With fewer police stations and big areas to cover, he says that partnership is key.#I#d love to be able to click my fingers and open more police offices, but that#s not the world we live in. It#s about working smarter and in partnership with others.#He continued: #I#ve spent some time getting out and about and I#m still getting used to the size of the area, but it#s gorgeous.#Though still travelling back to Hamilton at weekends to his we and two-year-old daughter, the plan is to move the whole family to Argyll in time.Inspector Collins concluded: #I#m looking forward to getting my we and daughter across here, because I think they#ll fall in love with Argyll just as I have.#"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know the new play equipment will make a real dference for local children and families in Campbeltown and we hope to see the fundraising campaign reach its target as soon as possible.#Councillor Kelly added: #I am delighted to have been able to secure this fantastic donation from ScottishPower Renewables and I would like to thank Gillian Arnot of the company for her sterling work in this regard.#Both Iona, and Catherine Dobbie of Campbeltown Community Council, are working tirelessly in an effort to secure the balance of the funding required.#Any donation large or small will be most welcome and will contribute to making Jock#s Adventure Playground inclusive and accessible to all children.#The swing-set – with an adapted seat with straps on one side and a wheelchair accessible swing on the other – will be installed in a vacant area at the council-owned playpark which currently has just one wheelchair accessible item.Iona was inspired to start the campaign after own experiences when taking her children, seven-year-old Esmie and four-year-old Lyle, who has autism, to playparks in Campbeltown and surrounding villages, and noticing the lack of equipment for children with less ability.So far, £, has been donated through an online fundraising page set-up with the aim of raising the additional £, required.In a bid to boost the total, Iona has organised the silent auction of a hamper of goodies donated by local businesses. Worth a combined total of about £, the hamper includes a one-night stay for four people at Ugadale Cottages a four-ball for Machrihanish Dunes Golf Club for four people one Serenity Spa hot stone back massage a selection of products from Serenity Spa and a bottle of -year-old Glen Scotia single malt whisky.The closing date for bids, which can be submitted privately via Iona#s Facebook page, is pm on Sunday .A further fundraising boost came thanks to two Campbeltown childminders, Sarah Mckeown and Carol Linfield, who organised two sponsored #teddy toddles# for the children who attend their settings.Sarah said: #Lyle has attended my setting for the past three years and we wanted to do something that the other children could join in with to help their friend raise the funds needed to purchase the inclusive play equipment.#There were two walks, last Thursday and on Monday, so all the children could take part. Ranging in age from one to five years old, the children and their teddies walked, ran and danced from the ferry terminal to the former paddling pool, where they received special medals and certicates and enjoyed a picnic. On Monday, they were joined by Lyle at the finish line.Visit gofundme f inclusive-swing-for-campbeltown-playpark to contribute to the fundraiser."},{"url":null,"title":"safety first as shops reopen","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These campaigns testy not to an instinct for the #survival of the fittest# but to an inbuilt recognition that justice should be done.This should not be surprising. Our Creator is a God of justice made in his image, we reflect his character. He takes particular care to demand that minorities and vulnerable people receive, not just equality, but special respect and privilege and that justice should be upheld.Psalm : reads: #The Lord watches over the sojourners [racial minority], He upholds the widow and the fatherless, but the way of the wicked, he brings to ruin.# Justice is good.However, BLM and #Me Too aren#t sufficient to right society#s wrongs. Why  Because while pointing to the guilt of others, they fail to recognise we#re all guilty. We#ve all failed to love our neighbours as ourselves, we#ve all marginalised and discriminated against those not like us, even the protestor, even the victim perhaps not based on colour, but certainly on class, status or some other dference.This is where the Bible paints the full picture, justice is right, but reconciliation happens only through forgiveness. The Lord who leads in justice and who will judge all guilt, also leads in forgiveness. In the cross of Jesus, he absorbed the price of justice. He took the initiative. #While we were still sinners, Christ died for us#.The gt of God#s forgiveness is on offer.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

which contained an inn on the corner of Market Street.However, last orders may have been called at the pub, which has not been open for about three years.Flats would be created on each floor of the building under DSI Properties Ltdrsquos plans.Haddingtonrsquos community council did not object to the proposals but felt that the plans could be altered to keep the ground floor available for business use.The proposals suggest the insignia painted on the front of the building would be retained, something which was welcomed by the group.Paul Darling, one of the community councilrsquos planning liaison officers, said: ldquoIrsquom not averse to two flats but would quite like to see the bottom house kept for retail, personally.That view was backed by colleagues Pat Lemmon and Graham Samuel during the virtual meeting.The discussions came after it was highlighted that a number of businesses had moved into neighbouring High Street in recent months, despite the challenges brought by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown restrictions.Chris McEwan, chairman of the community council, said: ldquoI quite agree with what is being said.ldquoWe have got businesses coming into the town

are given the opportunity to provide their views on any planning application.East Lothian Councilrsquos planning department aims to make a decision on the application by the end of the month.The Haddington group agreed to write to East Lothian Council about the proposals, with community councillor John Hamilton suggesting it was ldquoa preference rather than an insistence that the business

the Gardeners.It reads: ldquoThe property was sold recently to our client.ldquoIt had ceased to operate as a public house almost three years ago and had been marketed for sale without

Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh: Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors: in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables.

Then, something caught his eye.He ran to Izzy: ldquoAunty, aunty, look what I found!He was holding a scarf.ldquoIt was hanging on a tree over there, he said.It was a short neck scarf, with Celtic interlacing design it looked new and unworn, possibly even handmade.ldquoI really love it aunty, can I keep it Izzy pursed her lips in thought.ldquoI dunno, Finn, someone may have dropped it and another person found it and placed it on the tree to keep it safe. Perhaps one of those walkers earlier. Maybe they will come back and look for it Finn wasnrsquot even half listening. He put the scarf on and rushed to the loch side to look at his reflection.ldquoIt would be safer round my neck surely  he called out.As he arranged the scarf, a folded piece of paper fell to the ground and landed by Finnrsquos feet. He picked it up, unfolded it and ran to Izzy, very excited.ldquoLook, the scarf is for me! he exclaimed.A worried look came over Izzyrsquos face as Finn handed her the piece of paper. There were beautully drawn Celtic designs, with images of what looked like faeries hiding in a wood.There was also a sleeping dragon curled round a heart shape in which there was handwriting: ldquoIf you have found me, and you like me, then Irsquom yours. Keep me safe, until itrsquos time to give me away.Izzy looked at Finn, nodded and smiled. ldquoSo it seems.ldquoI will never give this away! he insisted. He looked around at the trees and ed the gaze to his aunt.ldquoMaybe yoursquore right, aunty, maybe fairies do exist after all, at least here we are in the Highlands after all.He thought for a moment. ldquoOr maybe itrsquos just someone kind who likes to give presents.Finn headed back to the tree where hersquod found the scarf. He arranged twigs and broken bits of heather on the ground next to the tree and beckoned his aunt to come see.She looked down at what hersquod done. She didnrsquot immediately see it, but then realised that the twigs and heather formed letters.He carefully read it: ldquoThank you.ldquoThatrsquos lovely Finn, whoever left the scarf will see this and be very happy, Irsquom sure of it.Izzy looked up to the sky. The predicted rain was going to hold off.ldquoFinn, she said hesitantly, ldquowould you be up for a bit of an adventure ldquoYou mean a walk, donrsquot you ldquoKind of, aye, but this is to a place I have never been before, although Irsquove often seen it from a distance.ldquoHow far  asked Finn.Izzy pointed: ldquoJust there, where those old trees are. Itrsquos a small remnant of the old Caledonian forest, Irsquove often wanted to visit it but have never had the opportunity. Itrsquos not so far, but it might be a bit dficult to reach, Irsquove never explored it before.Finn wasnrsquot sure.Izzy helped him decide: ldquoIt might have a connection to the original Merlin.That sold it to him.ldquoWell, I have my boots, he smiled, ldquocan I lead the way So they set off in the direction of Coille Coire Chuic, a small remnant of the ancient Caledonian forest. Izzy let Finn decide on the route and as they neared the wood they arrived at the River Cononish. There was no obvious and safe way to cross, but Izzy was sure there was a small bridge downriver.The route got increasingly boggy and Izzy suspected Finn may want to give up, but instead he took the role of leader seriously and carefully planned each step, identying dryer patches and helping his aunt. They made slow progress, but with much hilarity as they balanced on small tufts of dry land surrounded by bog myrtle.Finn paused and listened. The noise of a waterfall could be heard ahead and he aimed for it. Izzy lagged behind to take in the beauty of the heather, which carpeted the ground with a blaze of purple and pink. The old Scots pines on the other side of the river looked magnicent, framed by the mountains beyond.She caught up with Finn, who was sitting on a rock watching the waterfall. It cascaded into a hidden pool, where the water twirled and bubbled asin a giant cauldron. Scots pine trees stood guard on the edge of it, one growing precariously from the overhanging rocks, its trunk curving upwards so its higher branches reached the sunlight. A gnarled rowan with vivid berries grew from the rocks on the other side, while on the opposite bank birch trees clung onto the steep side of the river, bent over like weeping willows.Finn wanted to sit awhile and so Izzy took it as an opportunity to make a brew for them both. He was beginning to understand that using her small camping stove was an important ritual for his aunt: the hissing sound, the waiting, the trail of steam, the anticipation it made a warm feeling, turned a wild place into home.They sipped tea together and shared well-earned snacks. Finn waited, expecting his aunt to tell a story. Finally, she did.ldquoSee that giant boulder over there, Finn, it was dropped by the giants who sculpted this land many years ago.ldquoLike with Samsonrsquos stone we saw Izzy nodded.Finn raised a cynical eyebrow and half a smile.ldquoHuge giants, Finn, a race called the Fomorians. The legend says they emerged from the sea long ago ndash grotesque troll-like creatures, incredibly powerful and cruel. Two of them made Rannoch Moor their home and they terrorised the people for miles around, destroying homes and taking livestock.ldquoNobody knew what to do, even the bravest and best warriors were defeated by them, ripped apart without mercy. Then a young lad about your age had his home destroyed by one of the giants, and in his grief he decided to rid the land of them.ldquoBut how could he do thateven the best warriors couldnrsquot Izzy gave him a wry smile, which he knew meant that was a good question and that she was just about to answer it.ldquoThe lad was wise. He had noticed how the two giants argued with each other about who was the stronger.ldquoSo he got them to fight each other ldquoKind of, he persuaded them to have a competition to see who could throw a stone furthest. They began hurling bigger and bigger stones, then they tore chunks of rock off the mountain sides. Soon the land was littered with boulders, and after three days the two giants were utterly exhausted.ldquoThen the young lad told one of the giants he had won, for he knew this would cause a fight. And so it did.ldquoThe giants fought each other with fury, using up what energy they had left. Finally, one gave the other a fatal blow, but it was the last thing he did, as he collapsed with total exhaustion.ldquoThey had killed each other ldquoYes, smiled Izzy, filling her cup with more tea and raising it. ldquoThatrsquos why the land around here is littered with all these huge stones.ldquoI know giants are mythological, aunty.Izzy sipped some tea.ldquoDepends what kind of giants you mean.Finn looked at the boulder.ldquoThe next tale is the gt of the sun, continued Izzy.ldquoAfter the death of the giants the land was bathed in sunshine, bringing new le.It became a green world, grass and plants grew, then trees arrived. The ancestors of this tree were first to arrive, she pointed to the nearby silver birch.ldquoOthers followed: the rowan, the aspen, alder and even oak. But it was these trees which made the forest canopy: Scots pines, also called Caledonian pines, an old name given to them by the Romans. Arenrsquot they a beautul tree Finn peered at the Scots pines around them.ldquoCreatures filled the forest with their songs, their roars, their grunting and howling the birds, bears, wolves, elk, deer and boar. Seven thousand years ago, where we sit we would have been amidst the Caledonian forest in its prime. Those trees over there are the descendants of that forest. If you sit with them and feel their presence, they will tell you their stories.Finn chuckled at his aunt, then explained why. ldquoYou are like Yoda! He defensively held up his hands to explain: ldquoNot the way you look, I mean the way you speak about things.Finn was a Star Wars fan. He had all three films on video at home and knew much of the dialogue by heart. He spoke to Izzy, mimicking Yodarsquos voice: ldquoSearch the force, le creates it, makes it grow, its energy surrounds us and binds us, luminous beings are we. Finn gently pinched Izzy on the shoulder, saying: ldquoNot this crude matter. You must feel the force around you, the tree, the rock, everywhere.Izzy laughed out loud, feeling rather flattered to be compared to one of Finnrsquos screen heroes.

As promised, Izzy spun legends of Merlin, but also other tales connected to the ancient forest: of Lailoken, the Picts and St Columba, and the sad tale of the last wolf. Finn added tales of his own, about Jedi Knights and what he could remember of the story of Tam Linn. The forest was both their theatre and audience. But there was a sense of melancholy in this wood, for something was missing: it was bereft of young trees. The old pines were missing their children.The walk back was much quicker and they arrived back at the car tired, but with a sense of achievement.

custody in the Midlothian station now face being transported to St Leonardrsquosin Edinburgh for lock-up.A meeting of East Lothianrsquos Police, Fire and Community Safety Scrutiny Committee, was told that the proposals would free up two additional local police officers for the county.However, concerns were raised by councillors about the additional journey time it would take for officers to transport people in custody to the Edinburgh station.Suzie Mertes, from Police Scotlandrsquos Criminal Justice Services ision, said that the number of people being taken into custody in Scotland had halved from , to , in recent timesand changes were being made as part of an annual review.She told the committee that providing custody services at St Leonardrsquos would be better for prisoners who might be vulnerable as more support services were available and would benefit local officers who were currently drafted in to ldquobackfill for custody officers when they were on leave.It was not made clear whether the decision to take custody officers away from Dalkeith would see opening hours of the station reduced or changed.However, Ms Mertes stressed that the custody facilities would not close completely and would be available for major events in the area or times when it was felt they were needed.And she said that current custody staff based at Dalkeith would be given the option to transfer their services to support local policing.She added: ldquoIn terms of Dalkeith, should someone need to be brought in for an interview it will be open.ldquoThis is a flexible model that will allow us to push and pull resources into Dalkeith when needed.Concerns were raised about the additional journey time for officers transporting prisoners to St Leonardrsquos for custody however, Ms

policing.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, committee convenor, said that the move could prove beneficial to those who found themselves spending a night in the cells as well.And the decision was welcomed by

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"pro-union-parties-indyref2-obsession-fuelling-debate","story":"In part, this obsession has led to the SNP being let off the hook for its failures in government as was reflected in this weekendrsquos election results and perpetuated by every media outlet across the country zoning in on constitutional questions.Over the past few weeks, the majority of pro-Union politicians have used every sound clip offered to them to exclaim their anti-independence thoughts rather than explain how they propose to get this country back on its feet and how they could work with the Government to put recovery first.With all eyes focused on the constitution, it has worked in the favour of the SNP who have managed to be elected to Government with a record number of votes, despite their failings over the past  years in charge.The First Minister herself admitted during the campaign that she had taken her ldquoeye off the ball as Scotland racked up the highest drugs death in Europe. But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons. Local businesses desperate to rebuild and get customers in their doors.Economic recovery is what matters to so many, yet we are so embroiled in constitutional questions that we lose sight of the ramications the past year has had for so many businesses and iniduals who have lost their jobs and families living below thepoverty line.There is no denying the fact that there is indeed an appetite to reopen the debate around independence, the recent vote shows an almost   split down the middle, but I do not believe it should be up to the media to frame the discussion.There is a huge job ahead for the next Scottish Government to deliver on a national recovery and all opposition politicians and members of the press must be focused on holding them accountable for the measures they are taking to get the country back on its feet.Letrsquos not do Alex Salmondrsquos job for him by inadvertently holding the SNPrsquos feet to the fire over independence but instead hold their feet to the fire over the nationrsquos recovery from the pandemic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

On the ground in front of us a trail of candy-coloured cordorm tiles are embedded in the soil.We are in a bosky glade in Jupiter Artland, near Rathoand Maclean is taking me to see her new work. Entitled upside mimi #### u#op , it is her first permanent outdoor commission. It takes her familiar concerns and her traditional aesthetics into new territory. For once the video artistrsquos fantasies have been made concrete. Or plasterboard and wood at any rate.ldquoIt feels like an extension of what Irsquod done before, but the idea of making an outdoor sculpture is a challengeyou make videos, Maclean admits.Still, thatrsquos what she has done. Follow the hearts and you find a shop that,at first glance,is all primary colours. But then you see the dirt, the graffiti, the abandonment.ldquoI wanted a building thatrsquos a bit like a shop that has closed down, Maclean tells me as we take her creation in. ldquoI really liked the idea of a building in a forest, for it to have the Hansel and Gretel feeling of you coming across this candy-coloured building drawing you in, but then whatrsquos inside it is darker and more dficult than it seems on the surface.Well, indeed. Within is a building that is itself topsy-turvy and is home to an animated film about a character called Mimi, one which takes in fairy tales, magic mirrors , consumerism, fear of ageing and the corrosive effects of social media. Itrsquos asDavid Lynch directed a Disney cartoon.Maclean looks like she has just walked out of a cartoon herself. Over the years for her video work, she has dressed up as everything from anime characters, cartoon lions and unicorns, to germs. Today shersquos dressed in a yellow patterned coat and yellow boots. Her hair is blue, pink and yellow.ldquoI think whenever I come to sculpture parks and see permanent artworks I wonder, lsquoWhat that will look like  years from now  Maclean explains, ldquoOryou didnrsquot look after it. So, Irsquove almost worked that into it to an extent. It hopefully feels like itrsquos been here for quite a long time already.Filtered through Macleanrsquos baroque imagination, upside mimi #### u#op is a fairy tale for the Instagram generation. The work both feeds on and dissects the white noise of our social media-inflected world.ldquoI guess Irsquove been interested in what the internet does for quite a while, ldquoMaclean explains. ldquoI think there was a time for feminism when the internet seemed this really utopian thing. Disembodiment basically. You can go on and you can become something completely dferent, and you no longer need to be defined by your body and your gender and how you look. And that seemed great, a whole new conception of gender.ldquoBut the reality of the internet has bizarrely intensied our obsession with our bodies, despite effectively being a disembodied space.ldquoIrsquom interested in that feeling as a woman of visibility and invisibility, where sometimes therersquos a power to being visible and making non-conventional beauty something that is visible. But therersquos also a degree to which sometimes you feel like invisibility would be a comfort.Based in Glasgow, Maclean grew up in Dollar in Clackmannanshire, which looked at in a certain way, might be a fairy tale background in itself. ldquoI guess Dollar is an almost chocolate-box Scotland, Maclean agrees. ldquoItrsquos got the hills and the glens and the castle and all of that stuff that as a tourist you might expect to find in Scotland. There is a fantasy aspect to it as a place.Her love of dressing up was apparent from childhood. That didnrsquot make her a show-off, she says. ldquoIrsquom quite shy. But Irsquove always liked dressing up. One of my earliest memories was dressing up as a popcorn box for the Dollar Gala, which is maybe when I discovered some part of my personality that has been dficult and useful. I get quite obsessed with an idea and then Irsquove just got to do it. I just had to be the popcorn box and it was this obsession for at least a month and then I did it and I was like, lsquoOh, well, itrsquos okay.rsquoRead More: Jock McFadyen on sex and violence and ScotlandHer work has what you might call a gendered aesthetic it is drawn to textures and colours and ideas that draw on popular notions of femininity. But itrsquos an act of both interrogation and reclamation.ldquoI think I get beyond the surface of things a wee bit, especially with this kind of imagery, this feminine aesthetic, which is fed to children and little girls,ldquoArtistically, itrsquos often treated as being not serious enough, almost not masculine enough of an aesthetic to make work. For me I think itrsquos almost a political thing to take that world we are all familiar with and really delve into it a bit more. There is an aspect to it that works to suck you in, it does something to you that you just feel like, lsquoI want this.rsquo Or it does to me.The implication is that itrsquos imagery thatrsquos not taken very seriously because itrsquos girly, un-masculine in some way. This is something Maclean feels the need to battle against the idea that masculinity equals seriousness.ldquoI think I am aware as an artist thatyou are a woman and you make masculine work you are liable to be taken more seriously thanyou make more feminine work.In other words, masculinity is signicant, while femininity can be labelled silly or frivolous.ldquoI am politically interested in that because I think it challenges people to work out why they would normally dismiss that aesthetic. I think it can be dismissed as, lsquoOh, itrsquos silly.rsquoldquoButyou dig a bit deeper, itrsquos a larger dismissal of female experience and this idea that for women to have power they have to ape masculinity, and femininity needs to be abandoned.She has no intention of doing so. Indeed, Macleanwants to take it further. She is currently working on a script for a feature film, suggesting shersquos ready to follow in the footsteps of Steve McQueen who has alreadymorphed from artist to filmmaker.ldquoI at least want to try it once, Maclean says. ldquoIrsquove had to learn quite a lot about it. Video art is supposed to break rules. Thatrsquos what itrsquos there for almost. Thatrsquos the expectation you take to it.ldquoBut with a feature film you have almost got to fit it into a pre-existing structure or  people wonrsquot even recognise it as a feature film.

What are you doing tomorrow, Rachel, I ask  ldquoFinishing the film, she says wearily. There is still a little rendering to do, she says.

Sitting in the Macbobrsquos main auditorium with my sister-in-law I looked around to see two other people in the audience. Four seats filled in a venue that could hold, in pre-socially distanced times, . Such were the times.I didnrsquot really care much for the movie, an overengineered high-concept thing, to be honest. But it was good to be in a cinema again. Especially this cinema. This was where I did most of my student film-going back in the s. In more recent years Irsquove seen films in its smaller, custom-made cinema, but on this night we were in the larger theatre which was where my younger self had sat all those years ago.I spent a lot of time during Tenet thinking about the times Irsquod sat in this room before. The filmrsquos central idea ndash of two dferent time streams travelling in reverse directions and intersecting ndash only encouraged it.I found myself wondering thatI sat there long enough I might catch a glimpse of my younger self, sitting in this same cinema nearly  years before when I was a student, at a Saturday morning matinee of the s sci-fi movie Forbidden Planet, surrounded by kids, sitting beside a girl I was totally smitten with, who, in the timestream that was running forward from that moment, would later become my we.That thought ndash of being back in the same room in  with the person I loved most in the world but who had died in  ndash made the night worthwhile, evenI didnrsquot care much for the movie.In the absence of movie-going over the last year Irsquove been thinking a lot since last September about how cinema was at the heart of our relationship, and how our first days together were spent in the dark.The first time Irsquod ever had a proper talk with Jeanie was about the movies. A late-night conversation in the kitchen about an old screwball murder mystery wersquod both seen that summer called A Night to Remember, starring Loretta Young and Brian Aherne, a chat interrupted when a fellow student came in from a night out spent drinking Pernod and black and hiccupped up his evening all over the table. A few weeks later watching Paul Schraderrsquos Cat People at the Allanpark cinema in Stirling I watched Ed Begley Jr get his arm chewed off by a black leopard. In the film the blood washed across the floor and over Nastassja Kinskirsquos shoes just like the Pernod and Black across the table, I remember thinking.Those first few months with Jeaniewere spent at the movies. Afternoons and evenings all spent in the dark. Some days wersquod make a day of it, travelling through to Falkirk and the ABC cinema in the afternoon and then back to Stirling for an evening showing. We even watched the films now and then.Trashy horror was our favourite, though, thinking back, Irsquom not sure how appropriate The Entity ndash a lurid film in which Barbara Hershey is molested by an invisible demon, unmakeable nowndash really was as a date movie.Itrsquos a pretty normal pattern for a love story, isnrsquot it  Itrsquos what couples did, still do, . In Phantom Empire, his  book about cinema and its impact on us, the cultural commentator Geoffrey OrsquoBrien asks at one point, ldquoWhat did people do, anyway, before there were movies  Well, exactly.Cinema was our idea of fun. It was a pattern set in both our childhoods. Jeanie always told me that she had left the Brownies after she came home to find that her dad and her sister had gone to see Krakatoa, East of Java without her.Irsquod grown up in Northern Ireland watching Disney movies, James Bond films and Zulu at the local fleapit . I remember taking an Action Man pistol with me to see Jaws for reassurance.Irsquod go and see films and then rush back the next night to see them again. Good films, bad films, indferent films. Even the much-maligned  version of King Kong .Years later Irsquod tell its star Jeff Bridges that Irsquod seen it more than once. I think, I said, it might have been because of Jessica Lange. ldquoYeah, he agreed, laughing, ldquoit might have had something to do with her.Cinema was always a desire machine. The sex symbols of the th century were film stars . From Rudolph Valentino to Marilyn Monroe, and James Dean right up to Scarlett Johansson.Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It HotBut it was always about more than sex. The critic Molly Haskell writing in Film Commentrsquos new weekly newsletter the other week quoted Susan Sontag on the post-war embrace of the idea of the movies as art, ldquoborn of a conviction that cinema was an art unlike another: quintessentially modern, distinctively accessible poetic and mysterious and erotic and moral hellip That was still the case in the s and s when we started watching. In time, we fell in love with Chinarsquos Fth Generation filmmakersand the outrageousness of early Almodo.But cinema also offered what it has always offered a dream of escape, of lives unlived of glamour and aspiration at times. And also fear and anxiety and the thrill chill of the dark. A spectacle shared with other people sitting in the dark.Therersquos an electric thrill when a film is good to share it with an audience. The collective rush of it. Sometimes the audience are irritating, of course. Sometimes, they are the only fun. I remember watching some second-rate movie in New York. The rest of the audience were really into it, however, cheering and whooping at every action sequence. They made the movie more entertaining than it really was.And now here we are, after a year without movies, more or less . Therersquos a lot of hot air talked about how the pandemic might be the end of cinema. I donrsquot really buy it. It will take cinemas time to come to terms with the new situation as they are allowed to reopen, but audiences will .Cinema is changing, of course. In , Geoffrey OrsquoBrien could write with confidence, ldquoThe camera prowls around the room. This is how the eye works at the end of the twentieth century, after a hundred years of training.Does it still, nearly  years later  Do we have the patience to follow the camera around the room  Perhaps not. But then cinema has been changing throughout its history ndash from silent to sound, from movie palace to Cineworld box ndash and still it thrives. In , there were  million UK cinema admissions earning pound, million in box office takings. We may take some time to feel confident to , but we will. Because itrsquos a dferent experience to sitting in front of your laptop or TV screen.TenetThere are so many new films I want to see. Dune, Chloe Zhaorsquos take on Marvelrsquos Eternals, Baz Luhrmannrsquos Elvis movie , Edgar Wrightrsquos Last Night in Soho, Jessica Chastain in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Jordan Peelersquos take on Candyman, Wes Andersonrsquos The French Dispatch, Jane Campionrsquos Power of the Dog, Celine Sciamarsquos Petite Maman. All will turn up on streaming services, sooner or later. But to see them in the cinema is still the ultimate viewing experience. Size still matters.The last film I took Jeanie to see, a few weeks before her death, was Crawl, about a Florida hurricane and man-eating alligators. She loved a good scary movie. I am inordinately fond of this film now because it was the last time I got to sit in a cinema and hold her hand.I will never be able to do that again. But I can go and sit in the dark again. I can go and watch a movie and dream about the past and the future and lives lived and unlived.

This would be in tandem with a keen ongoing focus on mental wellbeing.A reasonable timescale then for a phased approach could be testing hybrid models in the autumn, allowing arrangements to evolve naturally, followed by new ways of working being formalised in the new year.Underpinning this will necessarily be assurances on staff safety.

Like last week the victor was once again the SNP and just like last weekrsquos Holyrood election, the SNP was defending the seat. The dference for the SNP this time was this was the first Westminster by-election in which it was defending the seat and again the voters sent a clear message, albeit with a reduced majority.It is not so many years ago since this seat and the whole surrounding area would have been painted red, red of the Labour Party and once the constituency of Labour Home Secretary John Reid, Labourrsquos Scottish Secretary Helen Liddell, so was this result yet another catastrophe for Scottish Labour  Did the UK Labour Party even notice the result  I ask in light of the result of the Hartlepool by-election the week before, when Labour lost the long-held seat to the Conservatives.

After  stagnant years of SNP rule the results suggest that the wee fellow now sports a black and yellow rosette, but that its attached to a tee shirt emblazoned with the word \"FREEDOM!\".Andrew Trombala, Stirling.TIME FOR A NEW CONSTITUTIONNICOLA Sturgeon has shown a remarkable degree of courage in proposing that an independence referendum be called during the le of the present Scottish Parliament. The SNP does not hold an overall majority, which would suggest that such a referendum would result in another No vote. The Greens would exert such demand for their support that no responsible First Minister, which Ms Sturgeon most certainly is, could possibly agree to them.Furthermore, there is no way that Scotland could be viable economically on its own. Nor could Scotland be part of the European Union. For a start, Spain would veto such a proposal. Over the years Scotland has received enormous subsidies from Europe to develop its infrastructure. The EU, therefore, would hardly welcome a country which it would have to subsidise. Then again there would undoubtedly be a hard border with England. This would result in problems currently being encountered in Ireland and in England.However, the status quo may not be the only alternative. Clearly the time has come for the four home nations to get together and draw up a new constitution, probably on federal lines. Lets all get together and find ways of keeping together for the common good.W Findlay, Bishopbriggs.IS THE BORDER REALLY FIXED I READ with interest David Leasks article . Whilst it is debatable how realistic a threat this is , it is worth noting that in February , SNP MSP Christine Grahame called for Berwick upon Tweed to be given the opportunity to become part of Scotland, should Scotland become independent. Alex Salmond laterannounced that he would make the necessary representations to Westminster should this occur.It would seem that neither side considers the Scottish English border to be particularly \"fixed\".Gavin David Bell, Lanark.* I TAKE issue with Leaskrsquos mention of Orkney and Shetland remaining with rUKScotland chooses independence. The people of these islands, offered a democratic choice among Scotland, rUK and Norway, would probably opt for Norway. Look at an atlas this makes sense.The Declaration of Arbroath , a beloved icon of the SNP, was signed by Scottish barons ndash the posh people, many of Norman origin ndash when Orkney and Shetland were under Norwegian jurisdiction.William Durward, Bearsden.NO EVIDENCE ON IRAN CLAIMSI SEARCHED in vain for any evidence produced by Struan Stevenson in his article about Iranian interference in the recent Scottish elections . He posits only possibilities, rumour and comment as proof of such interference.The Henry Jackson Society has been discredited as a right-wing, neo-conservative outfit which suggests to me that, where Scottish independence is concerned, some bias might be evidenced in its findings.I also must question Mr Stevensons examples of the Scottish Government kowtowing to \"the mullahs\" ndash the use of this phrase itself suggestive of a less than neutral view being opined. It is strange that Mr Stevenson describes Alex Salmond in , in his role as SNP International Affairs and Europe spokesman, as somehow kowtowing to Iran whilst the record shows the UK Government trade deals with Iran amounted to some pound million during .Mr Stevensons assertions relating to the First Ministers invitations to participate in the ious Ahl Al Bait conferences merely highlight that no matter what decision she took, she was wrong in Mr Stevensons opinion.Whilst I appreciate it must be dficult for Mr Stevenson to accept the SNPs landslide victory, he really should check his facts before giving vent to surmise and gossip.Eileen Michael, Ralston.UNION BLINKERS SEEM TO BE ONI AM intrigued to observe that there appears to be a condition which could be described as blinkered vision suffered by those advocates of the Union which is the United Kingdom.I listened to Alister Jack, the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland, listing the many massive benefits that Scotland gts to the UK. The list was long and the praise effusive. It merely confirmed to me the signicant assets which Scotland enjoys. These would of course benefit an independent Scotland and their loss would cause serious economic pain to an rUK state.However, when I read the contributions from the unionist supporters in the Letters Pages, I seem to see a completely dferent picture. It would appear that these unionists can only see a Scotland bereft of any assets perpetually going cap in hand to beg the largesse of the English-controlled Westminster Parliament. They see no connection between  years of belittlement of Scottish aspirations and what reads like obviously deep-rooted feelings of inadequacy.It is therefore apposite to point out that they also fail to see the major failings of the NHS in England which are at record levels while incessantly criticising the NHS in Scotland. There are many other instances which makes me think it is actually a definable psychological condition. Hopefully time will bring a cure.David Stubley, Prestwick.LET THE OTHERS VOTEIF we are forced by the SNP to endure yet another referendum regarding Scotlandrsquos independence from the UK I believe the following points need to first be considered.Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly said that Scottish people should determine their countryrsquos future, so why does she not propose to allow Scots currently living in another part of the UKto vote for the future of their country  This exclusion is particularly hurtful given that non-UK citizens just arrived in the country would be allowed to have their say.If the union between Scotland and the rest of the UK is to be questioned in a referendum, it could well be argued that all UK citizens should be consulted. Scotland is not a British colony seeking independence but is a closely integrated partner within a highly successful union of nations. There can be few Scottish residents that donrsquot have family members living in other parts of the UK and surely everybodyrsquos view should count on whether they should be separated by a hard national border.Jim Duncan, Monmouth, Wales.Read more: Thanks for showing that Johnson and Patel do not act for us"},{"url":null,"title":"took-12-years-build-wall-tradesmen-even-worse","story":"No one could have taken the last named seriously. ldquoHail, Rab! ldquoAye, right.As usual with the irritating past, therersquos no definitive explanation as to how the wall came to be known as Graham. It seems to have started off, in medieval times, as Grymisdyke or Grymersquos Dyke, this being an older or northern version of Graham. If you were Graham, it was Grym up north.But who was Graham  Well, according to the medieval chronicler John of Fordun, he might have been the grandfather of an ancient king called Eugenius. There was a Gryme who allegedly stormed the wall in the th century AD, when it was still supposedly of use to those living south of it.One Robert Graham also crops up in an inscription dated rather dodgily to , and thought to be a forgery. Certainly, it has no connection to Roman times, as there werenrsquot any Rab Grahams around then. RAB:Billy Connolly: lsquoIrsquom the only guy I know who died in a f*****g Muppet moviersquoI was also discomfited to discover that Graham or Graeme was a nickname for the devil in parts of Scotland ndash kinda puts old Satanrsquos gas at a peep like being called Harry or Bernard ooh, scary! So, that would make it Devilrsquos Dyke. Griacutemr or Grim are also handles for Odin or Woden, who were considered devils by Christians.At any rate, as walls go, Graham is seen as a poor manrsquos Hadrian, with much of that perception due to the fact that little of it survived, which is what happens when you use turf and wood rather than stone like that big fancy effort  miles south.I should say this is more of a Roman than a Scottish icon. If yoursquove never heard of the Romans I can exclusively reveal they were a ghastly bunch of fascists who tried to militarise the world. Their only saving grace was that the peoples they conquered were often even worse, though hopelessly disorganised.Emperor Antoninus Pius ordered the wall to be built as a northern frontier against the barbarians . You might ask why the Romans decided to stop there rather than going the whole hog. If yoursquore a common or garden anti-Scottish Scot, you say: ldquoThey could have taken all of Scotlandthey wanted to but there was too much forest and stuff. Naw. They couldnae. It was an ever-expanding empire. They didnrsquot say: ldquoDrsquoyou know what, I think wersquoll just stop here. And the whole of Britain was forest. They built a wall there to stop themselves getting skelped. RAB:Declaration of Arbroath. Scottish icons by Rab McNeilConstruction began in AD and went on for  years, which sounds astheir tradesmen were even worse than ours until you factor in that it was  miles long, stretching right along todayrsquos Central Belt from Old Kilpatrick in the west to Borsquoness in the east.The number of forts along it is put iously as  or , and there were also nine fortlets, built especially for shorter people.The wall was ft high and ft wide, with a deep ditch on the northern side. It was constructed by the soldiers of three legions ndash the nd Augustan, th Victorious and th Victorious Valerian . Itrsquos thought that these fellows were mostly auxiliary troops, drawn from across the Empire, often from places with better climates. They must have had a blast, living in leather tents or wooden huts and singing morosely through the rain at the end of another dayrsquos labour: ldquoAll in all, itrsquos just another turf in the wall.There were around , soldiers stationed at the wall, and itrsquos not known what they did all day other than marching up and doon, like these goons guarding things that you see in movies. Some would be training or mending tools or just sitting about the bath-house gossiping. A board game was found in Bearsden, where many people still play bridge today. RAB:How did we end up with the Saltire as our national flag Other items have been found, such as altars and childrenrsquos shoes, which are more interesting than that usual standby from archaeology: pottery. They must have had a lot of evening classes in the subject back in ancient times.Some lucky archaeologists who get to examine ancient poop have found that the soldiersrsquo diet was mainly vegetarianand consisted of stuff like figs, herbs, berries and nuts. Ooh, yummy.They werenrsquot vegetarians on ethical grounds. A distance slab found at Bridgeness, West Lothian, depicts a bull, a pig and a sheep being led to sacrice, with musicians drowning out their screams.The Romans, precursors of western civilisation, believed that offering animals to their gods brought good fortune. This was because, like all people in the past, they were nutters. So were their gods.Another  shows Britons being trampled, speared and beheaded, the last thought to display contempt for the Celtic veneration of folksrsquo nappers.That distance slab can be seen in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, but most others are in Glasgow Universityrsquos Hunterian Museum.

I never give my viewsimply a background to the topic in question.I emailed them a week ago, after the results of the Scottish Parliament elections emerged, and after the initial reaction settled in my consciousness. I told them that the decisions made by a small group of unionist politicians over the next few months will probably determine whether their children are born into a country called Scotland, or a country called the United Kingdom.There is no inevitability about the electoratersquos view on this. Sure, we may have gone from perhaps  percent of Scots certain to vote Yes a decade ago, to perhaps  percent today, but we still have those middle-of-the-road voters, the people who donrsquot wave flags or go on marches, who will ultimately decide the constitutional fate of all of us.It is perfectly clear to me that current behaviours point to only one home for those decisive voters ndash nationalism. The unionist reaction to the SNPrsquos landslide victory in the election was hysterical. It might have been rather amusing, actually,the matter at hand were not so serious.It neednrsquot be this way, but turning this around will require the unionists ndash particularly the Conservatives ndash to change the psychology of unionism. They need to be re-educated. To paraphrase Einstein, the unionists cannot solve their problems with the same thinking they used when they created them.We can travel back as far as we want for examples of unionism creating its own problems, however we need only look back a decade to see exhibit A. In , after an unrelated meeting in Downing Street, I was asked for my view on the upcoming independence referendum, with polls at that time recording - percent for No.I told my questioner thathe fought the referendum on the basis that lsquoNo means status quorsquo he would win narrowly or, on a bad day, might even lose. He looked at me the way you might look at someonethey vomited on your kitchen table. I was told that they would fight on the status quo and win by  points, before I was dispatched.A couple of years later, just three days before the referendum, a petried Downing Street put lsquoThe Vowrsquo on the front page of the Daily Record, leading to the Smith Commission and the third tranche of devolved powers.If it looked like a panicked, half-hearted and disingenuous bung, itrsquos because it was. Just like the Calman Commission before it, which was the unionist response to the SNP victory of , this was peak reactive unionism.It could have been very dferent. In a conversation which was little known at the time, but which has since become accepted fact, when the Yes campaign was polling somewhere less than one-third, then First Minister Alex Salmond offered then Prime Minister David Cameron a dferent kind of referendum. The proposal was that there would be two questions on the ballot paper the first a lsquoyesrsquo or lsquonorsquo to constitutional change, and the second an lsquoindependencersquo or lsquodevo maxrsquo to the type of constitutional change.Had Mr Cameron accepted the offer, it is not a stretch to suppose that the devo max option would have won by a seismic margin polling at the time certainly pointed towards this. Had that happened, it is also not a stretch to suppose that the immediate and growing momentum for a second plebiscite would have been absent from mainstream debate, confined to the -or-so percent who always have, and always will, believe that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.The core determinant in Mr Cameronrsquos refusal of the offer by Mr Salmond is the same core determinant which is preventing unionists from making rational decisions in the wake of this latest SNP landslide ndash psychology.In the final analysis, saying no to Mr Salmondrsquos offer was the only logical output from a coterie of people who are emotionally and psychologically unwilling to embrace devolution. It is primarily a Tory phenomenon, but Labour-types should not be naive enough to believe that it doesnrsquot, at times, infect them too.They suffer from a very British disease which sees decentralisation as defeat. Unlike in the Anglo-Saxon countries to which we exported democracy, British unionists view pockets of power outwith the capital suspiciously, as a threat. Where Americans fiercely protect the power of state government, we fiercely protect the power of the central government. Where Canadians see separate provincial political parties as an expression of local ersity, Brits see them as a slippery slope to political separation. Where Australians celebrate their states having codied and clearly understood governance, we tinker with localism according to the prevailing politics of the day.And what good does that do us  Which of the four countries in question is in danger of fragmenting  Only ours.Unionismrsquos problems are not the creation of nationalists. In truth there has not been much of a pull-factor. They are entirely self-inflicted unionists have pushed middle Scotland away. It is true what some say, that change now may be too late. The current is strong, and it is pushing unionism out to sea. However,they want to at least put up a fight, unionists must reimagine unionism.The only viable United Kingdom, now, is a looser kingdom at ease with its many identities and embracing its political ersity. It is a kingdom enthusiastic about decentralisation, aware that localism is the adhesive which keeps it together, not the wedge which drives it apart.People sometimes ask: but what powers do you want  There are direct answers to that question, in both taxation and legislative arenas. However, this is no longer so much about what unionists do, as it is about how they do it.Devolution through gritted teeth will never change opinion, because it is so transparently grudged. The enthusiasm of Canada is missing. The cooperation of Australia is missing. The partnership of America is missing.The model of the Union Connectivity Review and the levelling up agenda, for instance, is sound, and is actually borrowed from federal systems. But the bitter, cynical, conniving undertone is turning it from a celebration of partnership into an attempt to create into a constitutional version of Stockholm Syndrome.Unionism can still prevail. It can win a referendum. But this is about far more than tactics and strategy. The uncomfortable truth is that, in the case of very many unionist leaders, their head is in devolution, but their heart is not.

Worldwide, the loan payment system is said to be now worth pound. trillion.The idea appears straightforward. The third party provider settles a companyrsquos bill with a supplier early and ingets a fee. This enables suppliers to get paid quickly while businesses can smooth out their debt payments over a longer period. Everybody is happy in theory.In , Greensill provided an estimated pound billion of financing to businesses in more than  countries.When Covid struck a year later, causing economic uncertainty, supply-chain financing became a very lucrative market and banks alone were raking in many billions in fees.But as the pandemic deepened, turbulence hit the global economy and Greensill, the largest non-banking provider of supply-chain finance, collapsed after its insurer refused to renew cover for its business loans.The fear now is, in this world of creative accounting, early payment loans provided by supply-chain financiers were not only being made for deals done in the past but ones expected to be done in the future.Indeed, profits have been recorded on the basis of future business, giving the appearance some firms are faring much better than they actually are. This lay behind the collapse of the outsourcing company Carillion.Apart from the Governmentrsquos own commissioned inquiry and the parliamentary probes into Greensill and lobbying, the Financial Conduct Authority is now focusing its gimlet eye onto the collapsed finance firm and what it alarmingly described as ldquopotentially criminal allegations.It doesnrsquot stop there.We now also learn the Serious Fraud Office is examining the business empire of Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta over suspected fraudulent trading and money laundering, including its financial arrangements with ndash Greensill said to have had around pound.bn of exposure to Mr Guptarsquos business.So, Mr Cameron now finds himself in the eye of an increasingly turbulent storm.Appearing before MPs, the multi-millionaire sought to portray himself as, not an ex-premier on the make, but someone who was continuing his role as a sincerely dedicated public servant.ldquoLobbying the UK Government was never intended to be part of my role, insisted Mr Cameron.Yet last spring as the pandemic struck he lobbied and lobbied away, sending dozens of text messages to, among others, Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, Tom Scholar, the head Treasury official, and Sir Jon Cunlfe, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. Some were signed off ldquolove DC.Greensill wanted access to the UK Government-backed loans scheme to help small businesses survive the pandemic.

Dismissing as ldquocompletely absurd suggestions he was in line for pound million, he politely declined to disclose his true remuneration, saying it was a ldquoprivate matter.One of the Greensill perks revealed was the use of a private jet, which Mr Cameron took advantage of on several occasions to fly to his ldquothird holiday home in Cornwall.With allegations of cronyism levelled against Boris Johnson and his Government, the fellow Old Etonian admitted there were ldquolessons to learn and a formal letter rather than a flow of chummy text messages would, in future, be more appropriate.Stressing how lobbying government was a ldquonecessary and healthy part of the democratic process, Mr Cameron nonetheless accepted former leaders had to ldquothink dferently and act dferently given the continuing influence they enjoyed.Having an ex-PM engaging on behalf of commercial interests, ldquono matter how laudable the motives and cause, could, he admitted, be ldquoopen to misinterpretation.But his lsquorather a fool than a knaversquo approach did not cut any ice with Labour politicians.Rushanara Ali, who represents Bethnal Green and Bow, branded Mr Greensill a ldquocon artist and told Mr Cameron his own reputation was now ldquoin tatters.Siobhain McDonagh, another London MP, accused Dave of having ldquodemeaned himself ldquoby WhatsApping your way around Whitehall on the back of a fraudulent enterprise based on selling bonds of high-risk debt to unsuspecting investors.The problem for the former PM is his humiliating ordeal may not be over.:Greensill Capital: David Cameron says he had lsquobig economic investmentrsquoGiven all the inquiries, not least the ones looking into suspected criminal activity, the ex-party leader - who made clear during his parliamentary interrogation that he had broken no rules and there had been ldquoabsolutely no wrongdoing on his part - might, nonetheless, find the Greensill story and its potential ramications reverberating in the Cameron head as tonight it slowly hits the pillow."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-return-hug","story":"Itrsquos been a while From spring last year, when the Covid pandemic began to impact our lives with lockdowns and the introduction of social distancing measures, the hug was put on hold to limit the chance for the virus to be passed on at close contact.We took them for granted Most would agree this is the case really as it was a natural part of pre-pandemic le we would think little of, from greeting a family member or friend with a hug hello, to comforting someone close to us by drawing them to our hearts.They are historic Itrsquos thought he word ldquohug hails from the word ldquohugga, meaning ldquoto comfort in the Old Norse language, first appearing approximately half a century ago in Scandinavia.They release oxytocin Oxytocin - a chemical in our bodies associated with happiness - is sometimes referred to as the ldquocuddle hormone because its levels rise when we hug.

How  could the delay in imposing travel sanctions between the UK and India be explained,not by considering that BoJo was keen as mustard to fly there later that month to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with Prime Minister Narendra Modi As Boris sat on his hands, at least , people travelled from India to the UK before the brakes were applied. Perhaps he was distracted by more pressing matters, like which shade of gold wallpaper would work best in his flat or what private Caribbean island hersquoll fly to next.Read more:Where is the support people need to deal with their Covid grief When asked by Marr as to whether he regretted this delay and the consequences that unfolded in giving the new iant a chance to stretch its legs over here, an exasperated Hancock said this was the type of ldquoCaptain Hindsight question that had been thrown at him throughout the pandemic. Wow, Matt. If yoursquore so fed up with being asked to reflect on the shoulda-woulda-couldas, why donrsquot you sharpen those foresight skills  You have your pick of mistakes to learn from.Hancock defended the delay by saying there was little known about the existence of the Indian strain of Covid to begin with. But surely the fact that India was being ravaged by a catastrophic surge in coronavirus infections ndash much more than Bangladesh and Pakistan, which were placed on the red list in early April ndash should have been enough to raise alarm bells  Marr presented Hancock with a bar chart showing how much higher the number of Covid- infections were in India at that point compared to Bangladesh and India. ldquoThis data is the wrong way of looking at it, Hancock said, before explaining to us silly little laypeople that actually, according to his data, three times as many people arriving in the UK from Bangladesh and Pakistan were testing positive for Covid at the border compared to those coming from India. Even he didnrsquot sound entirely convinced as he trotted out this line.Putting the moron in oxymoron, Hancock went on to describe the Indian strain of Covid- as being ldquowidespread in small numbers in the UK which is why hersquos confident for restrictions to ease in many parts of the country today. In his view, the best way to tackle any rise in infection is to firstly step up the rate of vaccination and testing and to secondly rely on people being ldquocareful in how they exercise their new freedoms.Itrsquos typical of the Conservative rhetoric that has permeated this pandemic. Here are the rules, butyou follow them and fall ill then itrsquos actually your fault for taking the guidance too literally. Yes, said Hancock, many people are allowed to eat inside a restaurant, ldquobut itrsquos still safer to dine outdoors than in. And yes, hugging is permitted for much of the country now, but we should remember itrsquos safest to do so with someone who has had two jabs.

The fact the former Swansea City and Liverpool manager joined a mid-table English outfit, not an Arsenal, a Cha or a Manchester United, simply exacerbated the pain.

The fluent French, Italian and Spanish speaker could potentially interest an overseas outfit too and may be tempted to go abroad. It all depends what offers he receives and what whets his appetite.Celtic fans were irked by the fact that Rodgers left before a third consecutive treble had been secured. That Leicester paid a cool poundm to lure him and his coaching staff away was ignored. For them, he was a traitor, a fraud, a rat.:Stephen Glass outlines when Scott Brown will start as Aberdeen player-coach after Celtic swansongBut he had grown frustrated by the financial restrictions he was working under here and the inability to take his side any further. Relations with the hierarchy were strained to say the least. A parting of the ways was best for both parties.He probably knew, too, he would never be considered by a major English club while he was coaching in Scotland regardless of his past experience. Leicester, as we have witnessed, was far too good an opportunity for him to turn down.The circumstances of his exit were certainly unfortunate, but the upward trajectory that both club and manager have been on since, not to mention the dficulties his former employers have encountered, have more than vindicated his contentious decision.AND ANOTHER THINGCongratulations to the Lowland League clubs for voting to allow Celtic and Rangers colts teams into the ision next season ndash a move that finally brings Scottish football into line with the majority of progressive European football nations yearsnot decades after it should have happened.The furore over this straightforward proposal has made you despair for the game in this country.

The discussion is an especially hard one to have on these British isles of ours. To say Scotland has \"dferent\" values to England is either heavy with anglophobia, or weighted with inferiority.We donrsquot shy away from assigning dfering values to other nations, though. France and its muscular secularism America and its love of the gun Australia and its scorn for social class. Each example, however, is a stereotype. Not all French are secularist many Americans hate guns there are plenty of Australian snobs.Over the last week, two events on the streets of Glasgow almost demanded that we discuss whether Scotland really does have values which dfer signicantly to the rest of the UK: the protest against immigration deportations in Pollokshields, and the disgraceful scenes of Rangers fans rampaging through the city.Letrsquos deal with Rangers first. Itrsquos easier to address values we donrsquot like. What happened ndash the thuggery, violence, sectarianism, destruction ndash has been condemned across society. Itrsquos indefensible. It disgraced the country. But it happened, and itrsquos happened before. There may only be a few thousands of these people in Scotland, but whether we like it or not, theyrsquore what the world saw at the weekend. They project an image of Scotland. We cannot escape that in the eyes of others wersquore blighted by sectarianism, and the hooliganism and intimidation that always accompany it. To those watching from outside Scotland, what happened in George Square represents\"Scottish values\", just as much as the football hooliganism of the s blighted the reputation of England as a whole on the worldrsquos stage.Read more: Dark forces of sectarianism have come to exploit independence and the UnionThe horrible irony is that we here, inside our own country, know that the vast majority of us reject such behaviour ndash that only a handful of the population behave like this. Yet to an outsider, wersquore all tarnished with it. Just as all Americans are seen,wrongly, as \"gun nuts\", we here in Scotland are being labelled, wrongly, in the eyes of other countries, as a nation where bigotry prospers. Scotlandrsquos shame, indeed.We may define ourselves in opposition to events like these however,we mean that, then we must prove it. To validate that \"value\" ndash the idea that sectarianism has no home here ndash we have to stamp out the little fires of sectarian hatred still burning around this country. Jail is a good fire extinguisher for sectarian thugs. Crippling fines a good fire retardant for those in authority who fail in their duty to society.The events in Pollokshields also tell a dferent story of Scotland, in comparison to the rest of the UK. With sectarianism, we share baggage with Ulster in our broad attitudes to immigration, though, we seem quite alone. Nowhere  in Britain would have been the site of such resistance to the Home Officersquos \"hostile environment\" policy. When one thousand people on the south side of Glasgow compelled Border Force officers to back down and prompted police to release two of their neighbours set for deportation, a clear iding line was established between \"Scottish\" and \"British\" values.What happened last week in Pollokshields was not a one-off. This country has a proud pedigree of showing respect and care for refugees, as long opposition to dawn raids and Dungavel detention centre proves.And here we get to the heart of this apparently dfering value between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Scotland is unique among most nations, itrsquos fair to say, on the issue of immigration. Brexit at its heart was an anti-immigration vote. Brexit didnrsquot appeal in Scotland. We didnrsquot vote to close our borders against outsiders. Northern Ireland, which also voted to stay in Europe, was voting for peace and stability rather than expressing a pro-immigration position. A Pollokshields-style event is as unlikely in Ulster as it is in England. In UK terms, Scotland resembles those Democratic \"sanctuary cities\" during the Trump presidency.None of this is to say that there arenrsquot voters concerned about immigration in Scotland, or whorsquod like tighter restrictions. But immigration is ndash at least for the time being ndash a much less pressing political issue here than it is in England. Perhaps thatrsquos a legacy of decades-long dislike of the Tory Party, associated as it is with hardline anti-immigration policies. That antipathy may also account for Scotlandrsquos much more vocal opposition to austerity.Clearly, though, we also enjoy the luxury of opposition without responsibility. Itrsquos much easier to hate a policy when you donrsquot have to pass laws on it. Many Scots long opposed to British immigration policies, who also support the idea of an independent Scotland, have expressed worry at times thatwe ever do split with the UK, we might find our own liberal attitudes to immigration evaporating in some quarters.Immigration feels destined to become part of the constitutional debate. Only the foolish couldnrsquot envisage Project Fear II identying this social dference and exploiting the spectre of mass immigration.Read more: After the death of Mercy, Scots Government should break Westminster immigrationScotland is also at odds with Europe on immigration. France drts ever closer to the embrace of the far right and the lure of Marine Le Pen. The EUrsquos Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, positioning himself for a run at the French presidency, said he wanted to suspend immigration to France, including family reunions. Germany without Angela Merkel may become a cold place for refugees. Italy has set a hard face against those seeking sanctuary.For the time being ndash in limbo as Scotland is, a nation without the powers of a nation ndash we can see that wersquore \"dferent\", although that dference offers both blessings and curses. Sectarianism, whether we like it or not, shows a Scottish face to the world. Kindness to the desperate and the downtrodden, to refugees needing support and friendship, also shows a Scottish face to the world.Perhaps, therersquos some comfort in that strange mix.

At the bottom of the pile is the common or garden yacht such as you might see parked up at Troon or Largs. Typically these have galley kitchens, a couple of bunks, toilets that would make an EasyJet loo appear spacious and names like Seas The Day or Buoyonceacute. Then therersquos the superyacht, which has a proper kitchen and a proper looand a deck long and broad enough to accommodate a helipad and a five-a-side pitch. And now we have the gigayacht which, as the name suggests, is even bigger than a superyacht.How big If itrsquos over  feet, isnrsquot armed with surface-to-air missiles and isnrsquot called HMS something, itrsquos generally reckoned to be a gigayacht. There are plenty of them around already but the number looks set to increase markedly:  was a bumper year for orders and sales, and  looks set to top even that. According to Sam Tucker of nautical market intelligence firm VesselsValue, the market is ldquoabsolutely roaring ... Therersquos been a record number of transactions done, and that trend is being sustained even until now. Second-hand superyachts are selling quickly too.Who has a gigayacht Nobody you know, though a few people you may have heard of such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. According to news organisation Bloomberg, Bezos has commissioned a gigayacht from Rotterdam-based company Oceanco at a cost of pound million. The price tag wonrsquot trouble him though. His personal wealth is estimated to have doubled since  and now stands at around pound billion. And not only is he having a  foot gigayacht built, he has also commissioned a motorised superyacht support vessel for it.

Another example is the Black Pearl, a slightly smaller gigayacht built by the same Dutch company for the Russian oligarch Oleg Burlakov. It has an aluminium superstructure and carbon fibre masts, generates its own electricity when itrsquos under sail, employs heat capture technology throughout and as a result is thought to be able to cross the Atlantic on a mere  litres of fuel.

Even those free of this tendency, however, may be tempted to mull over what there is to be said for it, since there isnrsquot much abroad abroad, as it were.There is the exciting ldquogreen list of about  countries that the UK government will let us travel to, though thatrsquos no guarantee that the countries themselves will. But the choice is limited. You can go to St Helena, the South Sandwich Islands and the Falklands, but in Europe your options are Iceland, Gibraltar or Portugal.:Boris Johnson is right: the rules donrsquot apply to him, by Andrew McKieNo doubt more places will go on the list as we get towards the summer, but there will still be some people hesitant about the wisdom of piling into a tube of recycled air and wall-to-wall strangers in order to get to some country where, on the EUrsquos record so far, most of the population wonrsquot be vaccinated.The experience of previous rises in coronavirus cases after the Easter and summer holidays last year may also lead some to think that it will be safer to stay in the UK. And the fact that countries that chose to close their borders and keep their economies open, rather than the other way round, seem to have had better results may be one reason why the UK government is slow in reopening travel.Though they will be worried about the airline industry, the authoritiesrsquo chief concern is probably encouraging tourists from other countries to come and spend their money here, rather than worrying too much about whether we can go to Torremolinos or Ayia Napa to spend our money there.Even those of us who are enthusiastic travellers sometimes forget how very recent such journeys are for most people. Many of us have got used to the idea that good weather, major landmarks and decent food are readily available within a couple of hours, often with a plane journey costing less than the anorak yoursquod need to buyyou were going to spend the summer in this country.But itrsquos only in the last  years that this has been an expectation for many people, and only really in the past  or so, since budget airlines became commonplace, that it has been readily affordable for almost everyone. One of my grandfathers, born in the centre of Glasgow, never travelled any further than the Isle of Wight, and Irsquom not sure the other one ever left the country, either.Even when I was growing up in the s, foreign travel was still relatively exotic: I was well into my teens before I went as far as England, and my sole experience of abroad was a single trip to northern France. I was  before I had been on an aeroplane, and my impression is that that wasnrsquot especially unusual in those days.Yet by the time my own children were teenagers, theyrsquod notched up visits to at least a dozen countries, partly because taking them abroad on holiday was usually a good deal cheaper than going somewhere in the UK. Vacations in Cornwall, the Scottish islands, rural Wales or the Norfolk coast now have more social cachet than going to Benidorm, and a price tag to match. While wersquore at it, the word ldquostaycation, which is so ugly it shouldnrsquot exist anyway, can only mean staying in your own house while yoursquore off work going anywhere  in the UK is a holiday, just not a foreign holiday.The fact that the UK attracts nearly  million foreign visitors a yearsuggests therersquos plenty to do here ndash therersquos hardly an international list of top destinations that you ought to visit that doesnrsquot have London in the top three, but the sheer ersity of British landscape and heritage more or less guarantees somewhere interesting to go.If you can afford it.

You can always bring abroad to you. There are countless books, internet material and television programmes about almost every corner of the globe:you really wanted to, you could probably find out more about Vientiane or Mombasa or Port-au-Prince in a few hours online than you would by going to those places, without any of the cost, discomfort or time involved.The collections of almost all the worldrsquos important museums are available indigital form. The most exotic foods are available in every high street: in the s, olive oil was a specialist ingredient now your corner shop will sell you kaffir lime leaves, plantain or zarsquoatar.Therersquos just one element that canrsquot readily be provided: sun. At this time last year, the strictures of lockdown, still a relative novelty, were offset for a lot of us ndash or at least, those with access to the outdoors ndash by uncharacteristically good weather.

The number of vehicles on a personal car lease is now double the amount just two years ago, according to industry body theBVRLA.It is overtaking traditional methods of car purchase, such as HP and PCP. With an HP deal the monthly repayments are usually very high, while PCPs - Personal Contract Purchase offers on new cars - are more complex due to the often-high initial deposit, followed by whether you should buy the car at the end of the term or hand it back because the value in the car has reduced too much or use any equity in the car as a deposit for a new car. Decisions, decisions!Thatrsquosnot the case with car leasing.Itrsquosfar simpler than that.First off, you never actually own the car but lease it - a long term rentalyou like - fora period of time. And that makes the monthly rentals more affordable.Ifyoursquorethe type of person that likes to lsquoownrsquo their car, consider that many drivers thatpurchasetheir car, donrsquot keepitforever. Many opt to tradethe carin for a newoneat some point,so evenlsquopurchasedrsquo cars are only used for a specic period. And of course, the process oftradingin comes withitsown hassles. Leasing removesthe complexityand makes jumping into an all-new car a simpler and more regular experience.The payments you make each month cover the cost of the car calculated on what it cost new and what its value will be at the end of your rental period. But this is what makes leasing so attractive. Youdonrsquothave to worry about the value - the funding company takes all that risk away from you. Allthatrsquosrequired of you is to drive the car for your agreed rental period, enjoy your choice of vehicle during that time, and then hand the car back at the end of your agreement. Is that simple, or what Itrsquosworth pointing out here that by making the lease agreement that simple, you also agree to hand the car back in a reasonable condition that is expected of a car at that age and mileage. You might not actually lsquoownrsquo thevehiclebut you still need to look after it as part of your contract.Butthatrsquosno dferent than looking after a car you might purchase.Second, with car leasing you need to decide how long you wish to drive the car for. The most popular terms which Intelligent Car Leasing has on its website are  months  months or  months.Generally speaking, thelonger the period, the lower the monthly rental payments will be. But you may decide that you want to swap your car more often, so  months would probably be a better choice.Third, you need to decide how many miles you want to drive each year. On the Intelligent Car Leasingsiteyou can simply configure the amount of miles you want to drive in the vehicle search bar, but we offer everything from  miles a year to a mega , miles. If you are uncertain,the friendlyleasingexpertsat Intelligent Car Leasing can help.If it helps, annual mileage is dropping to around  miles a year for personal leasing agreements, according to data from a comparison site, but the changes to lestyle following the pandemic may meanitrsquoslower as more people decide to work from home.Leasing offers many other benefits, such as road tax being included, thereby saving you even more money, anditrsquosworth pointing out that you can spec your preferred vehicle to your exact choosing.Andyoursquore considering an electric vehicle, leasing is byfar the best approachto ensure yoursquore neverstuck with outdated technology.Andthatrsquosit!All you need to understand about car leasing, made simple.

This is an extended version of one of them.Michael Faraday was one of the world’s greatest scientists.He was also one of the first to recognise the importance of reaching a wider audience and he had the perfect venue for this, at the Royal Institution in London. The lecture theatre there is probably the most famous in the world, thanks to the Christmas Lectures he began in , which have been televised since . It was designed by an Orcadian, Thomas Webster.Thomas’s father Alexander was English, but his mother Mary was the daughter of Thomas Baikie, the minister at St Magnus Cathedral, and Thomas grew up in Orkney.According to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he attended Kirkwall Grammar School, and then went to Aberdeen University in , where “he assisted Professor Patrick Copland, a populariser of science.” Professor Copland was a pioneer of public education, whose extramural classes ran from  to . He also pioneered the use of demonstrations in his lectures, so Thomas may have taken a few new ideas with him when he went to London.Thomas Webster enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London as an architectural student in , and had his own business by . He began “a school for mechanics,” and this came to the attention of Count Rumford, one of the founders of what became the Royal Institution. Rumford’s aim was to encourage the use of mechanical inventions and improvements, and to encourage “the Application of Science to the Common Purposes of Le.”At the age of , Webster was engaged as treasurer and secretary of the Institution and, as Clerk of Works, superintended the transformation of a house into a suitable building. In January , he was told to prepare plans for a new lecture room. Many years later he wrote:The theatre of the Royal Institution is pronounced to be the most perfect room of the kind in the kingdom for possessing the properties of allowing the lecturer to be well heard and seen by the audience and for affording them easy entrance and exit, c . . . it has been stated by Faraday, in his late examination before a committee of the House of Commons, to be ‘almost perfect as a lecture room,’ and that ‘although architects are continually measuring and drawing it to copy from, and many other rooms have been built in imitation of it in which he has tried his voice, yet none of them proved equal to that in question.Sir Humphrey Davy was the first scientist to draw crowds to the lecture theatre, which could seat  people. He also made good use of the laboratory which Thomas Webster had installed, using electrolysis to discover sodium and potassium. Webster wrote later: “The chemical laboratory in which so many valuable discoveries have been made was not only designed and built by me, but owes to me its very existence, for, though I inserted it in my plans, the managers did not at first consider it necessary.”Count Rumford had assured Webster that he was going to establish a science school for workmen and, as he wrote to a friend:It was through the prospect of being employed in this way, which would have been as agreeable to my habits of thinking as useful to my interest, that I was induced to give up the school which I then kept and the other business in which I was engaged, and to accept of a situation and salary in the Institution by no means equivalent to what I should have considered myself as entitled to under other circumstances.Eighty years before compulsory education, he had found that new techniques in building needed better-educated workmen.Knowing from previous experience what it was possible to effect in their improvement, I conceived the idea of giving to mechanics for this purpose a species of scientic education suited to their condition, and I believe I was the first person in this country who took active steps for effecting so desirable an object. I was not unacquainted with the political feelings of that time, but I did not think a little learning was a dangerous thingjudiciously bestowed . . . My idea was to make good mechanics, not to force them like hot-bed plants out of the sphere in which they are so useful.Webster succeeded in convincing the managers that the school was a good idea. News of the school was published, and was very well received. Sadly, after all the preparations were made, ideas changed.I was asked rudely what I meant by instructing the lower classes in science. I was told likewise that it was resolved upon that the plan must be dropped as quietly as possible. It was thought to have a dangerous political tendency, and I was told thatI persisted, I would become a marked man!Webster decided to leave the institution and embark on another career, as a landscape artist.This somehow led to work on textbooks and a commission in , to draw one of the first geological maps of England. Geology was a very new science the Geological Society had only been founded in . Sir Henry Englefield, President of the Society, commissioned Webster to survey and draw the geology of the Isle of Wight. This was published in .Ten years later, Webster became the secretary of the Geological Society and curator of its museum. Soon, he was back at the Royal Institution.Notices of lecture courses in the s include Faraday on chemistry and Webster on geology. He gave the Christmas Lectures, “suitable for a juvenile auditory,” in .University College London was founded in , and Webster became its first professor of geology in .He is described as the first professional geologist, because it was then still seen as a gentleman’s hobby. Unfortunately, this meant that he was poorly paid and, although he was awarded a government pension of £ a year for services to geology, he had to find other sources of income.For the last ten years of his le, he worked on a commission from Longmans Publishing. The enormous  Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy brought together all “the information useful to persons who have to superintend domestic establishments.” It begins with where to build your house, and goes on to cover everything from the dferent options for heat and light to the preparation of every sort of beverage, from gin to coffee.It is now well known that Isabella Beeton stole material shamelessly for her Book of Household Management, published in .Her main source was Webster’s Encyclopedia: on the Arrangement of the Kitchen and General Observations, on beverages, bread, etc. Thomas Webster was unable to complain about her plagiarism.He had died aged  in December . He was a man ahead of his time, so got neither the payment nor recognition that he deserved but his writing, though uncredited, has stood on more bookshelves than all other Orcadian writers put together.Mrs Beeton’s Cookbook sold two million copies in its first decade alone.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There followed four years of painful negotiation Theresa May was anointed, became a lame duck, and departed as PM to be replaced by Boris Johnson.Johnson saw off Jeremy Corbyn and ‘got Brexit done’ as he said he would, but post-Covid he might yet be done for himself. As rumours rage that in preference to lockdown he said he would tolerate a virus # from which he almost died # spreading so severely that bodies could “pile high on the streets”, there is a growing sense that the public reckoning he has long escaped may finally be in sight.Meanwhile in Scotland, having survived the ugly fall-out from of an investigation into the handling of sexual harassment complaints against her predecessor and political mentor Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon remains odds-on to become First Minister again in  # perhaps even with the overall majority she was unable to secure in .Whether victory leads to a second referendum depends not only on next week’s result but on whose ‘rights’ will take precedence in the eyes of the UK government who by law would need to sanction another vote.Because inescapably it is Covid-, how it is tackled and treated, and how we can recover as a country from it, that is the major issue facing all of us.It seems lamentable that, amid the constitutional flux and an increasing entrenchment of views, that there has been so little sign of a consensual approach – between both governments and parties # to steer the country away from the crisis.And that brings us back to the original point about the late Charles Kennedy.The landscape which he occupied has altered beyond recognition, but has changed politics meant better politics or brought improved outcomes  The jury is out, and it is a question voters should consider as they head for the booths.’ brought some encouraging news.Having seen the treatment Mr Kennedy received back in , the LibDems have called for a “a zero-tolerance approach to abuse and to lead a respectful campaign”.Their pledge calls for derogatory, untrue, or hateful messages on social media to be publicly denounced and challenged to treat political opponents and journalists with respect, and to run an honest campaign.The SNP, Tories, Labour and Greens – all of whom have members who have experienced threats and abuse in ious forms – have all signed up.It would be a fitting tribute to Charles Kennedythis is one electoral promise they can work together and fulfil."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Eoghan-MacLeod-scaled.jpg","title":"barra service superhub hundreds sign","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePublished on Monday, the petition has already gathered well over  signatures and was created by -year-old engine cadet Eoghan MacLeod from Vatersay.: “I started the petition to get a measure of how many people agreed with me that the hub plan as it stands needs big changes for it to meet the needs of the island.“I’d heard plenty of people in person talking about their concerns so I just put together what I’d heard and put it on the petition to seewe could make these concerns more visible.“My grandmother is currently in the old folks home at St Brendan’s as she has dementia and needs to be looked after around the clock. Before there was a space available for her I was away in college and my mother had to care for my grandmother as dementia caused her to become increasingly dficult to look after.“My mother had very little free time as she had to look after my younger siblings, manage the croft, work five days a week and care for my grandmother. Replacing the old folks’ home with ‘social care flats’ would not be adequate for looking after my grandmother.”Mr MacLeod’s ‘Halt the Hub’ petition on the  degrees website is addressed to the comhairle, Scottish Government, SNP election candidate Alasdair Allan and Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil.It states: “If the comhairle is going to spend £ million on a development on Barra they shouldn’t dismiss opinions expressed by the people living on Barra. The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3800606.jpg--.jpg?1620905531000\n","title":"beth backs foster fortnight with her deeds and words","story":"BALLYMENA Councillor Beth Adger can speak with some authority on the topic of fostering.Having fostered nearly  youngsters over two decades, she was the ideal person to voice Mid and East Antrim Council’s support for Foster Care Fortnight.

It brings a huge change to your le and huge responsibilities, because you are no longer a citizen in the same way as everyone , you are there to serve the people of Northern Ireland and that is a huge responsibility.Meanwhile, a former special adviser to six secretaries of state has called on unionists not to turn against each other at a time when the UK is under “sustained attack and threat”.Lord Caine said: “The Union will not be secured by unionism turning in on itself, retreating into history or singing the same old songs, whatever short-term comfort that might bring to some.“The surest foundation for the future of the Union and Northern Ireland’s place within it has to be an open, inclusive and tolerant unionism that understands, is comfortable with and embraces the values of the modern world.“It has to be a st century unionism, with a narrative that speaks to people outside its core base and whose mission is to build a more stable, prosperous and secure Northern Ireland that everyone, irrespective of their background or ultimate political aspiration, can be proud to call home – a Northern Ireland based on a shared and united future rather than a ided past.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadSleazy married NI cop had sex with woman on dutyNorthern Ireland Protocol ‘legally rotten to the core’, High Court toldPrice jump: Hotel room costs surge as more NI families opt for staycationSDLP health spokesperson Cara Hunter apologises for breaching Covid guidance with weekend stay in Donegal Former Miss NI Anna Henry on her romantic marriage proposalTop VideosPlayUUP#s Doug Beattie to be next party leaderPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday LePlayVideo: Flock of Kerry sheep claim a fluffy dog as one of their ownLatest PoliticsEquality Bill for teachers supported by Assembly Suzanne BreenOpinionRealistic and progressive, new leader brings lot of goodwill, but has a big job to turn that into votesHow events unfolded after the death of former IRA man Bobby Storey Allison MorrisOpinionBobby Storey policing report will bring some relief for Byrne but fallout won’t go away just yet  Maghaberry Prison book ban row may end in courtLatestAflac’s Keith Farley: ‘This city is home to our highest skilled staff’Tributes paid after popular Fermanagh teacher dies in her sEquality Bill for teachers supported by Assembly Darren Clarke and MPs back Portrush golf hotel plansCity restaurant is made three times bigger as South stays shut,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It will attract tourists from around the world.”Mr Shaojun expects two to five million visitors per year, which, he expects, will guarantee aon the investors’ financial backing.However, the Titanic replica has not been welcomed by everyone.One said on social media that the Titanic is an “ominous ship” and questioned why anyone would spend , to stay for a night.Another said: “Replicating a ship from a deadly shipwreck, what an ‘interesting’ business plan.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadSleazy married NI cop had sex with woman on dutyNorthern Ireland Protocol ‘legally rotten to the core’, High Court toldPrice jump: Hotel room costs surge as more NI families opt for staycationSDLP health spokesperson Cara Hunter apologises for breaching Covid guidance with weekend stay in Donegal Former Miss NI Anna Henry on her romantic marriage proposalTop VideosPlayUUP#s Doug Beattie to be next party leaderPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday LePlayVideo: Flock of Kerry sheep claim a fluffy dog as one of their ownLatest WorldEndangered red wolves born at US zooBiden expresses ‘support’ for ceasefire in Netanyahu callBiden to boost world vaccine sharing commitment to  million dosesElection watchdog says no credible proof of Myanmar election fraudDonald Trump to speak at North Carolina Republican Party convention in JuneLatestTributes paid after popular Fermanagh teacher dies in her sEquality Bill for teachers supported by Assembly Darren Clarke and MPs back Portrush golf hotel plansCity restaurant is made three times bigger as South stays shutBaby joy for former Westle star Brian McFadden,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Eaacutebha Mullanand Ciaroacuten Mullan , from Ballerin, have written about the loss of their father Kieran Squealer Mullan in , when the siblings were just five and three years old. Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Brooke McEldowney, a Primary One pupil at St Brigids Tirkane Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted, has appeared in Three Families, which aired this week on BBC One. Three Families explores the emotive issues around womens rights and tells the story of the grassroots campaign to lt Northern Irelands restrictions on abortion. Brooke enjoying herself on set. Brooke landed the role after her mum Kirsty received an email from a casting agency. “When I opened an email about NI filming and how they were on the lookout for a young child, Brooke fitted the description,” she told Derry Now. googletag.cmd.push “It was all very overwhelming as the world was going through a pandemic and my daughter was now going to be part of a cast. It all felt like a dream.” For Brooke, the dream was very much a reality, and although she began filming at just four years of age, the young County Derry girl made light of the heavy schedule.  “She has been such a busy girl, taking everything in her stride and having so many dferent roles in filming and completely loving it all,” said Kirsty. “During the lockdowns while everyone was at home, I was arranging my other kids childcare and driving to our next destination for long days ahead. googletag.cmd.push “She had attended local drama and dance classes for a short while - pre-Covid - so this helped. She loved all the attention and getting chauffeured to each set, a few places I never expected to be.” Five-year-old Brooke has a central role in the drama as the daughter of actor Colin Morgan, previously of The Fall and actress Amy James Kelly, who has previously featured in Coronation Street. “When I met them and signed the contracts I knew that this was a big deal and how I had to keep everything a secret,” said Kirsty. “I had to travel myself to each set every couple of days prior filming to get a Covid test. Thankfully, they were all negative so Brooke could always continue with her role.”     The future is already looking bright for the Maghera girl, and she was handed a unique birthday present in February when she began filming on a CBBC musical drama series. “It was so perfect and fitting on her th birthday and the cast, producers and directors spoiled her,” said Kirsty. “Her confidence rapidly grew and has been even given spoken lines for on screen. She has gained multiple jobs since and has now been signed up by an agency.” Brooke on set with Colin Morgan and Amy James Kelly. Keeping her feet on the ground amid the excitement of her new-found fame will be an easy task with the support of her community and her school. “When ing to school after lockdown Brooke had days off due to filming but the BBC always liaised so well with the school,” said Kirsty. “Brooke is a very independent, intelligent girl and likes a good routine. She was thrilled when her teacher, Mrs Convery sent work via Seesaw and was always keen to get the tasks completed. “We are so proud and it has been an emotional journey as I have been involved in the Arts for many years and know how challenging it can be. “It’s all such an amazing experience and the opportunities it has opened for her have been remarkable. I am so privileged that we get to go on this journey together as mother and daughter. “We are bursting with pride.” Three Families is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

John was a very popular member of the Rosemount teaching staffand indeed his association with the school has continued long after his retirement with grandchildren now attending.

The Department for Communities decision to sell part of the site to the Western Trust in March marked the latest step in the ambitious project. googletag.cmd.push The land on the river front of the Bay Road coal yard was also recently acquired for the new cross border cycle network, which will include a new pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Pennyburn Inlet. The sale of the Bay Road site is being managed by TDK Commerical Property Consultants. In the sales brochure, it states: “The site measures approx. . acresand was previously used as a coal storage and distribution yard. The site benefits from  large warehouses, office building and a large covered storage area. “It has roughly  m of frontage on-to the River Foyle and this could be extended up the Pennyburn Inlet by around m.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We really do need to make progress on them but many people across Ireland and the UK are now reimagining what the future should be like.

Where have the Austerity Brothers George Osborne and David Cameron gone  Cameron has his own problems but Osborne is still bleating the balance the books mantra from the sidelines. I cant see that anytime soon. So, post Covid- what can we expect      Well for one thing Covid- has hit society in a way not seen since WW. I am old enough to remember the recession of the s and this is much worse than that. In the USA, President Biden has come out of the stalls clearly indicating that he wants to pump prime the economy with a major overhaul of decaying infrastructure. Its been hailed by many as a version of the post Great Depression New Deal delivered by President Franklin D Roosevelt. It really got the US back on its feet. Many across the island of Ireland are looking for a new normal. Of course, we all want to get rid of masks and go for a pint etc. but to slide back into a society driven by economic greed isnt as appealing any more. A lot has changed. The last  months has put many sectors in the spotlight. We have all clapped for health workers and carers but prior to all this, their pay and conditions didnt really interest us so much. This was the same for many of the jobs which during the Covid crisis became frontline. Delivery drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, cleaners and the people stocking the shelves of our supermarkets. Now, most of us appreciate the role they do and their pay and conditions matter more to us than ever. Without these people risking their lives and long term health society would have collapsed. Most of them didnt have the option to work remotely. They showed up and took care of the sick. They scrubbed down rooms or beds where Covid patients had been.  The point is they showed up and we now have a chance to reset our society and replace the clapping with a better salary. For me,it means a bit extra in tax, Im happy to pay it. Now when I see - Deliveroo drivers waiting outside a Take-away for a job I cant help but feel sorry for their plight. Before I was oblivious to it but now, I see just how unfair society has got. Some person designs an algorithm and sits in Calornia and earns billions while a delivery drivergets minimum wage. Many are now calling for a social revolution across society. Ive heard build back better and build back stronger bandied about like snuff at a wake but it makes perfect sense. In Derry, we have saw throughout this crisis a number of community organisations across the city step up and work in partnership with DCSDC and central government. Their roots are in the community and without their involvement during Covid- many more people would have died or slipped deeper into poverty. We really need to build on that. For me, there needs to be a major rethink at central and local government level on how we deliver the recovery. A cornerstone for this needs to be a recognition of the important role the community and voluntary sector play. We must mobilize these communities and connect with them and most importantly invest in them. If local or central government want to do community planning then invest real money in it and forget these detailed desk based action plans which often have no resources behind them but look great on a PowerPoint. And when you think about it who is best placed to help young people within some of our most disadvantaged get jobs. We have had an economic policy for the last  years which mixes encouraging and supporting indigenous businesses whilst attracting Foreign Direct Investment . Its had some success but it hasnt taken Derry off the top of the unemployment league for the North. There are quite a few other communities it has failed. Its now time to recognise that empowering organisations within these communities and backing them financially is the way to see jobs and a better society. And how do we do it  Within the North I would empower the Department of Communities and give it the budget to deliver it. They could jointly deliver this with Invest NI through the Department for Economy. That would be the best model for delivery. I would also put social enterprise and its promotion on a par across the island. There is no reason why more of our young people keen to start a business wouldnt decide on this structure. All the social enterprises I know make profits. Its what they do with these profits which is dferent. They reinvest in the staff and community instead of paying idends. Many others use profits to provide vital services in their communities. Many young people are already starting social enterprises and others are seeing a career working in a social enterprise in a dferent light. The biggest problem is that most people think social enterprises are confined to a sector. Theyre not. It’s more a way of doing a business rather than a specic sector. We have one chance to get this right as hopefully Covid is a once in a letime event. Already initiatives like Buy Social from the Department of Finance are recognising social capital in all their tenders. We need to do more, however. Lets not go back to the old normal because lets face it, things were not so great. President Harry Truman attempted a New Deal in the USA after WW. His  point plan which included developing a US version of the NHS and many other things failed. He also wanted to increase minimum wage and tackle some of the civil rights issues still visible in the US.It failed and most of the  objectives where never met. Lets hope we can learn from Covid and unlike President Harry Truman deliver a fair deal to everyone in society. Trickledown economics is a myth folks and its time we value people and work with our communities here to build a fairer society.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister.

Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change. Of course, this will not be easy but I hope that with government and industry working together we can build new infrastructure, become more prosperous, improve the marine environment and enhance our reputation as suppliers of quality sustainable seafood.Mr Poots said his department will be engaging with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report over the next few weeks and hopes that the next phase of work towards harbour investment can proceed shortly.He also confirmed that later in the year DAERA will be consulting on plans for a future fisheries fund to address the wider needs of the fishing industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Cara.jpg","title":"Cara opens first ever Irish Roots festival  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF schoolgirl was honoured at the weekend when she was asked to open the inaugural global Irish Roots online festival.Twelve year-old Cara Mailey is no stranger to appearing in television having appeared in several CBBC programmes over the last two years.However, on Sunday she became a storyteller for the festival which seeks to celebrate Irish people around the world with dferent skin colours.Along with Orla McKeating, the founder of Still I Rise Diversity Storytelling, Cara read two stories mdash Happy in Our Skin and I Am Whole.Both books celebrate dferent skin colours and celebrated the uniqueness of peoplesrsquo skin colours.Cara, who attends Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, was born with achonlasia, a form of dwarfism.She also had the opportunity to share her story, what she likes about her skin and then she also talked about what it was like being dferent to other children her age.Orla also read a third book called the The Little Crayon, a childrenrsquos story book written by -year-old Amelia Kai, also from Belfast.The daughter of Tricia Mailey, a teacher at Cedar Integrated Primary School in Crossgar, Cara has a big personality and has appeared on CBBCrsquos Dengineers and Crafty Party.Tricia said: ldquoCara has read for Still I Rise now for about a year.

Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward. Car parking will be a key requirement in the assessment process and indeed planning approval process.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car park is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.As part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics recently appeared on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.Downpatrick councillors say they are acutely aware that the opportunity to redevelop a huge area of town centre land will not happen again, with the redevelopment plan having the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-DundrumCricket.jpg","title":"Dundrum thirds make historic league debut  ","story":"SUNDAY was a momentous day in the history of Dundrum Cricket Club.For the first time the club have been able to enter a thirds team into league cricket and the Meadow was the venue as Dundrum took the field against Ards seconds with a team packed with experience and plenty of youth too.Dundrum captain Neil Reilly won the toss and elected to bat on a super wicket that the ground staff had prepared for the seconds the day before, but had not been used due to bad weather.In the first over, opener Eoin Moag nicked a gooddelivery which was caught frombehind by the Ards wicketkeeper,.This was followed in the second over by a Jack Calvert drive catching the edge of the bat and flying straight up to be caught, leaving Dundrum on  for .The tricky start was made worse when the captain was run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Ards, leaving the hosts on  for .This brought together a partnership between Keba Butler and Kristofer McNeill which finally found traction and started to produce a decent score.By the time Kristofer had been bowled for , the score had risen to  for  with some cracking shots by both batsman which on another day would have produced even more runs, but on a damp outfield restricted the number of fours.Andrew Hammond came in and produced a fast hitting nine to supplement Kebarsquos continued run chase which culminated in a not out score of  by the end of the allotted  overs.Ards came into bat and had a fast start, reaching  without loss after only three overs,.The captainrsquos second over proved to be a turning point in picking up two wickets for just a single run.

He was also survived by an elder sister, Robyn, and a younger sister, Maisie.When news of Ryanrsquos illness became known, his plight touched many hearts and local people got involved in charity initiatives to help him and his family.Lindsey has never tried cold water swimming before but she explained to the Recorder why she decided to try it out for the first time at Rossglass.ldquoThis was Ryanrsquos favourite place. We know he will be looking down on us, laughing his head off at his silly Auntie Lindsey and all her friends, said Lindsey.ldquoThis year would have been Ryanrsquos th birthday. He was such a gorgeous, funny, smart and cheeky boy. Our hearts broke when we got the news he had cancer, and they broke even more when he passed away.ldquoI wanted to mark our th year without him, which also would have been his th birthday, by doing something crazy. We had hoped to do it on his actual birthday but due to Covid- restrictions we had to wait.Lindsey will be joined by her close set of friends she has known for years mdash Amy McPhail, Laura Russell, Leoni Jess, Nicola Spence, Sammie Gawley, Sara Annett, Cara Brown, Grainne Loughran, Karen Mulgrew, Kerrie Macauley, Lynsey Logan, Lisa Noade, Orlagh Webb and Samantha Bogues.ldquoWe will all be meeting up for am and running in together and then probably running out again very quickly, said Lindsey.She said that Ryan loved nothing better than to fish, something he usually did with his dad Marc.ldquoOnce we knew that Ryanrsquos condition was terminal, he loved fishing so much that I contacted the famous angler Matt Hayes and he agreed to spend a day with him fishing. We took him to England and it meant so much to him, recalled Lindsey.ldquoThroughout his treatment and beyond, CLIC Sargent gave him and us so many cherished memories to hold on to ndash we were so very grateful.ldquoThe social care team were amazing and gave us all so much strength to help us through the darkest times. The charity is incredible.Vicki Ewart, fundraising engagement manager for CLIC Sargent Northern Ireland, said: ldquoWe canrsquot thank Lindsey and her friends enough for doing this amazing but baltic challenge and for highlighting the charity, they have raised over pound, already which will help so many families in Northern Ireland.Sadly every week in Northern Ireland another three children and young people aged - are diagnosed with cancer.

Treatment is intensive and emotionally gruelling and can last several years.The CLIC Sargent Social Care Team focus on three main areas, financial, emotional and practical support that is tailored to each team.Last year in the Co Down area CLIC Sargent supported  children and young people with a cancer diagnosis.You can make a donation by texting RYAN to  to donate pound,texts cost pound plus one standard rate message, or you can donate on the Just Giving Page at: https:www.justgiving fundraising Lindsey-Mcnabb-Phillips..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-New.jpg","title":"New Drumaness riverbank fence  ","story":"PLANS to provide a new palisade fence at the Mill Pond in Drumaness have been welcomed by a local politician.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason said the new fence will be provided between Mill Road and Shanvalley Way in the village.She recently organised a site meeting which was attended by Housing Executive officials and South Down MP Chris Hazzard to discuss the need for a new fence to improve safety.Cllr Mason said the provision of the new fence will come as a ldquogreat relief to many residents who have been increasingly worried as the riverbank had been left dangerously exposed recently as a result of damage to the old wire fencing.She said Sinn Fein is continuing to work with government agencies to identy responsibility for a number of safety issues relating to the Mill Pond area, including an urgent need to maintain the pedestrian footbridge at Shanvalley Way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Planners.jpg","title":"Planners give approval for Newcastle FC’s new home  ","story":"FORMAL planning approval has been issued by the Newry, Mourne and Down Council committee for Newcastle Football Clubrsquos ambitious developments for the future.The clubrsquos proposed application for a totally new complex at Church Hill, off the Castlewellan Road, has now been given the green light in what will be a major move for the seaside team.The priority for club officials is the development of three football playing fields, with a focus on a full sized grass pitch which will become the new home to the senior players.An U- grass pitch is also in development, along with an articial G surface also being put forward within the plansClub officials share hopes of a multi-purpose sporting facility to be added in the future, so that the grounds are not restricted solely to soccer.The application for the planning was officially approved last Thursday, with the proposal also entailing surrounding facilities to be added alongside the pitches.Club officials are planning to build a clubhouse, changing facilities, car parking facilities as well as spectator seating, which depending on further easing of restrictions, they will be hoping to make full use of.A new entrance has also been put forward to gain access to the facility, with fencing and gates in the works as well.Despite the planning approval, there is no start date issued as of yet for the beginning of the project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Residents.jpg","title":"Residents urged to get Covid jab  ","story":"RESIDENTS across the district who have not yet had their coronavirus jabs are being urged to do so as the unprecedented drive to protect the population continues at pace.The appeal has been issued by Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis and comes after the Department of Health confirmed on Monday evening that there have been no reported Covid cases in Downpatrick and the surrounding areas for the past week.Cllr Lewis mdash who got his jab at the SSE Arena in Belfast last weekend mdash said there are now many dferent opportunities for residents who wish to get the vaccine and understands that there are a number who have not had the jab due to personal circumstances and underlying health issues.

But the obstacles in the way of any meaningful change to the protocol are massive.Boris Johnson agreed to a Withdrawal Agreement in late  that has such huge ramications that the UK itself, we are now learning, agreed to impliedly repeal part of the Act of Union. That is a breathtaking admission.The Act of Union is a foundational, constitutional piece of legislation. No part of it should ever be repealed except in the most extreme situation, and then only explicitly.This is how serious things are for unionism.Mr Poots has few levers. One is to disrupt North-South relations and see what comes. There will be much sound and furyso, but it was Ireland and the EU, facilitated by a weak UK, that decided that East-West arrangements could be torn up.Another is to refuse to implement the sea border, on similar grounds. If the courts force implementation, or the UK intervenes, then at least it is made clear that such an affront to the settled constitutional position, which we were told could only be changed by consent, will not be facilitated by unionists, but rather,it happens at all, will have to be imposed. But one thing that will not work, or fool anyone, is talking tough about the Irish Sea border while acquiescing in it.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

If Mr Poots moves suddenly to remove her, that could be her final time facing questions to the first minister.Yesterday morning one of the incoming DUP leader’s closest allies, fellow Lagan Valley Assemblyman Paul Givan, said that Mr Poots had “made it clear that he wanted to engage with his colleagues in the Assembly before he would take decisions around ministerial appointments.“And indeed this is going to be a much more comprehensive overhaul of the Assembly team because he is looking at every position – chairs of committees, vice-chairs of committees, and indeed Policing Board membership.“Edwin’s focus is on engaging with colleagues he always has wanted the best people to populate those positions and that’s what he’s going to do.”Speaking on Good Morning Ulster, Mr Givan said he had not asked for any position in the Executive. It had ben reported that Mr Givan was lined up to be first minister, but two sources close to Mr Poots said that was inaccurate.Over the weekend, talk within the DUP was of North Antrim MLA Mervyn Storey as a possible first minister.When askedMrs Foster should leave earlier than she would like, Mr Givan said that Mr Poots wanted to have a team in place “to hit the ground running”.However, he insisted that the new leader was “sensitive that when change takes place...that’s something that has to be handled sensitively”.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityNasir Adam - Plaid CymruRaised in Butetown, the son and grandson of merchant navy, Irsquove lived in Cardf South my whole le and itrsquos where I still work and live and itrsquos here Irsquom raising my family. During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWhile Covid- cases in most areas of the UK are at their lowest levels since August last year,there are concerns the Indian iant could see cases jump back up.Data from Public Health Englandshows a rise in cases from  to , this week in the UK, with the agency saying cases were ldquorising in the community and it was assessing the impact and severity of the iant.One response being considered is bringing forward the date for a second dose of vaccine for eligible groups to increase protection.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the situation was being monitored carefully and the Government ldquowill not hesitate to take further actionnecessary.However, a small number of areas are seeing a rise in cases as the India iant spreads across the UK.The Prime Minister has said there is \"increasing concern\" about the iant and warned the emergence of further new iants \"pose a potentially lethal danger\".Where is the India iant dominant Surge testing has been under way in parts of Bolton since  May, after Public Health Englandconfirmed the town is one of the main locations of the India iant, which was reclassied as a lsquoiant of concernrsquo last week.Cases of the iant in England increased from  to  as of  May, according to PHE figures, with almost half of these related to travel or contact with a traveller.The majority of cases of the India Covid strain are concentrated in the north-west of England, predominantly in Bolton, and in London.The iant is also thought to be the reason behind half of coronavirus infections in Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen and South Northamptonshire, although these outbreaks are still small.Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has submitted a request to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation that all over-s in Bolton, along with the rest of the Greater Manchester area, are able to receive a Covid- vaccination ldquoto mitigate the risks of spread in those communities where we are seeing more transmission.     There are also around  to  cases of the India iant in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, with these cases again connected to travel.The India Covid iant, officially known as B.., was first detected in India in October.It has been designated a ldquoiant of concern by PHE as it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the iant detected in Kent last year, known as B, which is now dominant in the UK.PHE said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the new Indian iant is more serious than previous mutations, nor is there evidence which indicates that this version of the Indian iant is resistant to current vaccines.Health experts said they ldquohavenrsquot seen any hint of a current Covid iant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines.On Wednesday , the European Medicines Agency said it was ldquopretty confident that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant, a view that has been echoed by some British scientists.However, Professor James Naismith from the University of Oxford said not enough is known to say for sure whether the iant could frustrate the UKrsquos vaccination programme.Speaking on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme, he said: ldquoThe vaccines donrsquot  per cent prevent infection for people.ldquoWhat they do is, they almost  per cent prevent hospitalisation and serious illness.ldquoWe donrsquot know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that.ldquoSo even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection.Could the iant delay lockdown ending The growing number of India Covid iant cases in the UK has sparked concerns that the lting of lockdown restrictions, which is set for  June in England, could now be delayed.Ministers have also not ruled out re-introducing local lockdowns in areas where the iant of concern is increasing.Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said that the government will make decisions based on the data, and measures will be eased ldquoat a pace and in a way which is safe.Symptoms to look forThe main symptoms of coronavirus to look for include:a high temperature ndash this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new, continuous cough ndash this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste ndash this means youve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normalMost people with symptoms have at least one of these symptoms, although some do not experience any. As such, it is advised that everyone gets tested regularly to help prevent further spread of the virus. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The modernisation plans will also support a further  jobs during construction and development. Located at the busy junction of Dromore Road and James Street, the store will occupy an entire space of , sq. metres – more than double the size of its existing store – which will include an expansive sales floor of , sq. metres. The planning application lodged with Fermanagh and Omagh District Council will see the demolition of a neighbouring pub and private dwelling to make way for the expansion on a site that will also incorporate a-space car park with two electric vehicle charging points and new, complementary landscaping. Construction plans encompass Lidl Northern Ireland’s bold ‘concept’ design which prioritises sustainability, spacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms, employee and baby-changing facilities which will dramatically enhance a high-quality shopping experience. The site will also include a large warehouse and improved employee welfare facilities. The application follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in September  which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community. Conor Boyle, regional director for Lidl Northern Ireland, said: “We are delighted to confirm plans for a replacement store in Omagh which will see the existing store at James Street in the town double in size to provide a dramatically-enhanced shopping experience and new jobs for the area. Centrally located in the west of the region, the Omagh store serves a burgeoning and thriving community base and is conveniently positioned next to the A which is a major primary route and commuter corridor. As a major investor in our communities and in our local economy, the Omagh store is an important location for us, and I am thrilled to reaffirm our commitment to the local area as part of this multimillion-pound investment. We hope to receive planning permission for the site in the coming weeks and we look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store later this year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aeaebaddace   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdfefeabcfc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1621261923668.jpg--covid_19___mon_17th_may_figures.jpg?162126192300","title":"covid  mon th may figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows One further coronavirus related death and  new positive test results.
