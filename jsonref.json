It was perhaps ironic, therefore, that when Theresa May promoted Patel to run that department – with responsibility for spending millions in foreign aid – she swiftly overcame her objections.The National Audit Office later said money was being wasted by her department’s ‘rush’ to hit the 0.7 per cent target.On capital punishment, too, she dramatically changed her position. MPs had challenged Patel repeatedly on the question of whether British aid money should go to countries that still execute people. After dodging whether or not she supported the reintroduction of capital punishment several times, she finally said: ‘The answer is no. I have made this clear.’         Ms Patel\u0027s career appeared to be over when it emerged she met 12 senior figures from the Israeli government including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a family holiday to Israel          Critics now believe these high-powered meetings in Israel signalled her ambition to one day become prime minister. Now that she has won one of the four great offices of state, this prospect no longer seems quite so far-fetchedSo who exactly is this striking success story – testament, many say, to the power that hard work and discipline can still achieve in Britain?Patel’s Ugandan-Indian family arrived penniless in this country in 1972, fleeing the murderous tyrant Idi Amin and having to abandon a fortune in tea and coffee plantations.Her father, Sushil (also her middle name), abandoned plans to go to university and opened a corner shop in Tottenham, North London, with his wife Anjana and his parents.Patel, now 47, lived above the shop and worked most mornings behind the counter before school. She was educated at a comprehensive school in Watford, joined the Tory party at 17 and studied economics at Keele University. After a spell working for the Conservative Party under former leader William Hague, she became a lobbyist for cigarette companies.In 2004 she married Alex Sawyer, her former office manager, with whom she has a son, Freddie.She has said: ‘I’ve been brought up with Conservative values: family, work hard, education. I don’t think twice about working seven days a week.’         Ms Patel said she has been inspired by Margaret ThatcherSurveys of the ConservativeHome website, the bible for Tory activists, now consistently place her in the four most popular ministers.But in November 2017 her political career seemed to fall apart when it emerged that, on a family holiday to Israel, she had met as many as 12 senior figures from the Israeli government including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.She had not informed her department, or Boris Johnson (the then-foreign secretary), or Theresa May, who would have probably blocked the meetings. Critics accused her of seeking to run her own freelance foreign policy team in the Middle East.On her return, she demanded her own department change its aid guidelines to give money to the Israeli army so it could carry out humanitarian work in the disputed Golan Heights.In Westminster there was disbelief that she had barged into an area that was rightfully the Foreign Secretary’s. Using doublespeak that could have come from the TV series Yes, Minister, Patel claimed that Johnson had ‘been aware of the visit but not in advance of it’. She was forced to resign.Critics now believe these high-powered meetings in Israel signalled her ambition to one day become prime minister.Now that she has won one of the four great offices of state, this prospect no longer seems quite so far-fetched. "},{"url":null,"title":"JACK DOYLE analyses new Prime Minister Britain","story":"Share this article Deliver Brexit\u0027Never mind the backstop, the buck stops here\u0027         Theresa May leaves Downing Street for PMQs Prime Ministerial handover todayBritain will leave on October 31, ‘no ifs, no buts’. He will guarantee the rights of 3.2million EU nationals living here. Speaking directly to EU leaders in Brussels and Dublin he says he is ‘convinced we can do a deal’ but without the ‘anti-democratic backstop’.Leaving without a deal was a ‘remote possibility’ and would only happen if Brussels ‘refuses any further to negotiate’. Preparations for leaving will ‘accelerate’ from day one, and while he acknowledges there ‘will be difficulties’ he argues that ‘with energy and application they will be far less serious than some have claimed’.ANALYSIS: By avoiding directly attacking the EU, Mr Johnson wants to suggest how reasonable he is. In truth he is the iron first inside the velvet glove – making a plea for Brexit peace, but only on his terms. Yes, he wants a deal, but not Mrs May’s – the EU has to move. And if it doesn’t, he argues, No Deal will be its fault, not his.Preparing for No Deal is not a wild gambit but simply ‘common sense’. Britain will be ready, and will have the £39billion Brexit bill for ‘lubrication’.Fix social care\u0027My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care. We will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared, to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.\u0027         Care worker giving an old lady her dinner in her home (stock)Social care was the centrepiece of a hugely ambitious domestic policy programme outlined in machine-gun style. Policing, the NHS and schools all got a mention. As well as 20,000 more officers, Mr Johnson promised to end three-week waits to see a GP, deliver hospital upgrades and send more money to primary and secondary schools to ‘make sure your kids get a superb education’.‘My job is to serve you, the people,’ he said, ‘because if there is one point we politicians need to remember it is that the people are our bosses.’ANALYSIS: A subtle shift in tone from leader of the nation to servant of the people, and with it a pledge to address four issues that have the potential to damage the Tories with swing voters.As Theresa May found to her cost, there are few issues that resonate as much with voters of all generations as the injustice of the social care system. Combating rising crime and improving the NHS and school funding are essential to deprive Labour of ‘austerity’ ammunition if there’s an election around the corner.         European Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel BarnierProtect the union\u0027The awesome foursome that are incarnated in the red white and blue flag.\u0027Wrapping himself in the Union Flag, Mr Johnson promises to be PM for the ‘whole United Kingdom’, unite the country and stand up for British values.But he also wants to unify the country economically by helping the ‘left-behind towns’ and ‘answering the plea of the forgotten people’ in areas outside London and the South East.He will ‘close the opportunity gap’ and give ‘millions of young people the chance to own their own homes’.ANALYSIS: With clear echoes of his message during the Leave campaign, Mr Johnson is reaching out to voters who feel they aren’t among the winners in Britain today, and promising to act as their champion.He is also urgently seeking to neutralise a potent criticism of his Brexit policy: That No Deal could lead to the break-up of the Union as the SNP agitates for a new independence referendum.Embrace the future\u0027After three years of unfounded self-doubt it is time to change the record, to recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward looking, and truly global Britain.\u0027         Photovoltaics with wind turbines generating electricity in power station (stock)Rattling off a list of areas in which Britain is a world leader, he hails the strength of the British economy in ‘life sciences, tech, academia, music, the arts, culture and financial services’.He points to gene therapy used to treat blindness and battery technology to combat climate change, and he pledges to embrace the opportunities of the ‘post-Brexit future’ by doing free-trade deals, changing tax rules to encourage investment, embracing space technology and – more controversially – scrapping EU rules that limit the use of GM foods.ANALYSIS: In this final section, Mr Johnson promises to work ‘flat out’ to ‘give this country the leadership it deserves’ and paints a picture of the ways Britain will improve once Brexit is out of the way. After three years of ‘unfounded self-doubt’ it is time to ‘change the record’ and ‘recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain’.He is pointing to the glorious future that awaits as long as MPs don’t stand in the way, or in the event of an election, if MPs give him a thumping mandate to lead.          "},{"url":null,"title":"Those gloriously groan inducing dad jokes really make laugh new study shows","story":"Share this article Which Spice Girl can carry the most petrol?

The Caledonian Sleeper’s punctuality is the worst of any UK train operator.The company has delayed new trains that were set to be rolled out on the scenic Highlands routes to Fort William and Inverness until after summer.Ryan Flaherty, Serco’s managing director for Caledonian Sleeper, said: “We’re deeply disappointed by the result of the ballot. I believe we have shown a real commitment to dealing with the issues the RMT has raised and indeed there was an acceptance on all sides that progress was being made.“We remain open and willing to engage in further talks to avoid industrial action and are fully committed to delivering the best possible service to guests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d55e1e43a6cbebd19570921227c8252ee3501a56/0_91_2835_1702/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03042bb6060eefd33a8ebda08804002e","title":"why the heatwave is disrupting the uk railways","story":"From cheaper sleepers to buckled rails – all you need to know about the heat’s effects on rail travelTrain passengers across the UK have been advised not to travel if they can avoid it as the heatwave plunged the rail network into chaos.Many services were cancelled altogether, and severe speed restrictions imposed on services that are running.Here’s why extreme temperatures cause so much disruption to the rail network.The temperature of steel rails can climb 20 degrees higher than the air around them. So when temperatures are approaching 40 degrees, track temperatures can come close to 60 degrees. That causes the metal to expand, putting it at risk of buckling.The only way that Network Rail and train operators can respond is by imposing drastic speed restrictions, or cancelling services altogether, to avoid the risk of a train derailing from the misshapen track.Overhead electrical lines can also expand and sag, putting them at risk of being pulled down by trains.A third problem is that dry weather causes cracks, or even potholes, in the ground beneath the track. Trains travelling over such sections have to move more slowly for safety reasons.When Network Rail stress-tests its steel rail for its reaction to heat, it does so based on the mean summer track temperature in the UK, which is 27 degrees.In parts of Europe, and other hot countries, they assume much higher temperatures and manage their track accordingly.That can involve adjusting the track between seasons, to cope with extremes of both hot and cold. Another difference is that British tracks are typically mounted on sleepers, whereas rail networks in countries with greater climate extremes use concrete slab, which can cope with track expansion and contraction. Concrete slab track costs four times as much to lay.Network Rail says it would not be cost-effective to build the UK’s tracks in the way they do in hotter countries because we don’t usually experience large variations in temperature.The most obvious solutions are train cancellations, which is one reason why train operators have been advising passengers not to travel if they can possibly avoid it.Another is to introduce severe speed restrictions so any trains that hit a section of buckled track are not derailed. Some services could be running as slowly as 20mph on particularly hot stretches.Network Rail has also sent out extreme weather action teams (EWATs) to monitor the line and, in some cases, paint parts of the track white. This can reduce temperatures by up to 10 degrees.As the world heats up, it is highly likely that the UK will experience more record-breaking heatwaves, meaning periods of rail disruption will become more frequent unless action is taken.Network Rail published its strategy for coping with the climate crisis in 2017. Among the questions it is considering is whether it might eventually become more cost-effective to spend money now on track capable of dealing with the heat, to avoid mounting costs of repairs and compensation for affected passengers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3290a253aaa8a20e428a44d68b8166c605411f/0_175_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a5b4e035322b83ad876ef7d57b43a1a","title":"investors ecb european central bank economic stimulus brexit interest rates euro sterling pound dollar business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news as Mario Draghi prepares central bank for interest rate cutsMario Draghi is about to answer questions. Expect a lot of trying to catch him out on the timing and mix of stimulus measures.The European Central Bank (ECB) might have disappointed those looking for an immediate rate cut after the spate of weak sentiment data, but their statement of intent is clear: easing is coming, and soon. A tiered deposit rate, more QE and rate cuts are all options on the menu Draghi and the rest of the Governing Council are trying to show that they have not run out of tools. Shoring up their credibility is clearly a key priority and they cannot deny any longer that inflation expectations are anchored.The euro is just a whisker shy of two-year lows against the US dollar.It traded as low as $1.1107 in the aftermath of the announcement. If it breaks below $1.1106 it will be the lowest level since May 2017 by my reckoning – tantalisingly close (if almost entirely of symbolic value).Thoughts at the press conference (due in about 20 minutes) will turn to what mix of stimulus measures Draghi et al. will consider necessary at the September meeting.“The ECB is loading its bazooka, but with what?” asks Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.As we have persistently noted, the ECB never pre-commits. But this is as close at it gets.Further easing is on the way. But what kind? We are fairly certain that deposit rate cuts are coming, but today’s initial statement points towards a combination of rate cuts and QE. We are sure that Mr. Draghi will be quizzed intensely about this balance, and options, in the press conference. Demand for UK government debt has increased, with the yield on the 10-year gilt falling to its lowest level since September 2016.Some reaction from economists is now coming through.Ana Andrade, analyst at the Economist intelligence Unit, said it has “laid the ground for a cut, but will wait for September to implement further stimulus – which will then be backed by hard data and fresh macroeconomic projections.”Weak economic momentum and rising deflation risk, as measured by the substantial de-anchoring of inflation expectations over the past few months, call for further action.The press release reveals a much more dovish stance than expected. Up until now the re-start of QE remained a vague possibility. But the ECB’s decision to task the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options for further stimulus, and the formal reinforcement of the ECB’s commitment to the symmetry in its inflation aim leave no room for doubt about the ECB’s willingness to act. Whether by re-starting QE or by substantially cutting the deposit rate. There could be more quantitative easing on the way, with ECB economists in Frankfurt tasked with looking at options to “reinforce” its interest rates actions.The Governing Council has tasked the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options, including ways to reinforce its forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases.The euro briefly bounced higher, but has now hit another two-month low of $1.1118 against the US dollar.Read the ECB’s full statement here.There is some strong guidance on the future path of interest rates, however.Policy will remain “highly accommodative” for “a prolonged period of time”.The Governing Council also underlined the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and projected, have been persistently below levels that are in line with its aim. Accordingly, if the medium-term inflation outlook continues to fall short of its aim, the Governing Council is determined to act, in line with its commitment to symmetry in the inflation aim. It therefore stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner.The ECB’s governing council has voted to leave interest rates unchanged.From its statement:A reminder: the 12:45pm BST announcement will be followed by the press conference led by ECB president Mario Draghi at 1:30pm BST.You will be able to watch the ECB’s webcast of the press conference at this link. So a quick round-up as we prepare for the announcement: the euro is now flat for the day against the US dollar.With barely 10 minutes left until the ECB’s announcement, perhaps they will take a leaf from Turkey’s book?President Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed the previous governor, Murat Cetinkaya, on July 6 over disagreements on interest rate cuts and reiterated his belief that interest rates are “the mother of all evil.”Cetinkaya was replaced by Murat Uysal, the deputy governor. The largest carmaker in Britain, Jaguar Land Rover, lost £395m in the second quarter of the year after a sales slump.JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, blamed “weaker market conditions” as well as the Brexit-related shutdown of factories in April.

We are simplifying our business, delivering on our product strategy and adapting to the tough market environment. We will build on our strong foundations and increased operating efficiency to return to profit this fiscal year.Jacob Rees-Mogg, newly appointed leader of the house of commons, has resigned from his role at a London-headquartered hedge fund, according to the London Evening Standard.Rees-Mogg is a co-founder at Somerset Capital Management, and has earned hundreds of thousands of pounds as a partner at the firm. He was paid about £15,000 per month for 30 hours’ work every month for the past year, according to the latest register of members’ interests.The firm last year gained notoriety after it set up an investment fund in Ireland and warned prospective clients about the financial dangers of a hard Brexit.Boris Johnson has promised to make the UK the “greatest place on earth” in his first statement to the house of commons. Quite the echo of another blond world leader (and no mention of extraterrestrial ambitions from earlier in the week).Michael Gove is in charge of no-deal planning – what the Brexit department will be doing is unclear.A lot of spending plans: more money for the National Health Service 20,000 new police officers more funding for schools.And tax cuts as well, although sparse on the detail so far.On migration, he points to an Australian points-based system, but says EU nationals will have a right to remain in the UK.You can follow in a lot more detail with the ’s Andrew Sparrow on the politics live blog:With the ECB and the US Federal Reserve both looking to cut interest rates, what is the Bank of England up to? Not much, for the moment, appears to be the answer.The Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee meets next week (ahead of Thursday’s announcement) but will stick to its “solitary policy path”, according to Martin Beck at Oxford Economics, a consultancy.A 9-0 vote to hold rates steady is on the cards he says – with no change to its guidance that it will raise interest rates where other central bankers are reacting to a slowing global economy.A new PM, a likely shift in fiscal policy and continued Brexit uncertainty give the MPC good cause to continue a wait-and-see approach and leave the possibility of tighter policy until well into 2020. Amid further signs of dovishness from the US Fed and the European Central Bank, the monetary policy committee is likely to leave the BoE the odd one out among major central banks"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8811beddf257c6ae6b14103b4f0e098833489585/1029_638_3971_2382/master/3971.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4509e35da11eb12d7b29fb85d1c282a2","title":"the canal revolution how waterways reveal the truth about modern britain","story":"The remarkable transformation of canals worldwide is the ultimate symbol of how our cities have changed – for good and illEvery second Monday of the month, a small group of volunteers meets in the training room of a Birmingham supermarket. They discuss what has long seemed to many of their friends a crazy and probably doomed idea: how to excavate a contaminated 40-year-old waste dump, create an urban marina, restore three miles of derelict canal and build several new bridges and locks.Last month, however, the meeting of the 18-strong Lapal Canal Trust committee was joyous. After 20 years of trying to restore this short stretch of the 200-year-old Dudley No 2 canal, permission had finally been granted, they were told. What’s more, a feasibility study showed that the plan – which would link the suburbs of California and Selly Oak by water – could be a catalyst for nothing short of the economic and ecological renaissance of a large area of south Birmingham.The new canal will generate jobs but also provide space for new houses, as well as pollution-free walking, boating and cycling routes. The marina for 60-100 boats will stimulate businesses and bring in tourists. The wildlife corridor created along the canal will attract herons, otters, fish and waterfowl. And although the whole project will cost about £5m, the study said it would pay for itself in six years.“It will improve life in the city. It will complete an old canal loop around the city – we owe it to the future to restore it. We have support from business, the community, the university, developers and everyone. No one is objecting and we have nearly raised the first £250,000 – enough to start work,” says the Lapal trust CEO, Hugh Humphreys.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.The Lapal plan is one of at least 80 canal renaissance projects currently making British towns and cities suitable for populations seeking tranquility, leisure space and new ways to move around. Just as canal-building drove urban growth in the 18th and 19th centuries by linking urban areas and stimulating trade, a new mania for canal developments is today reshaping cities by offering oases of calm in fastest-moving town centres.In Seoul, the renovation of the Cheonggyecheon Stream – an old sewerage ditch covered by a gigantic elevated highway that was torn down and restored with clean water, plants, wildlife and attractive landscaping – has been credited with reorienting the city (as well as sparking a property craze whose effects have not all been positive).But few countries have as many urban canals as the UK, a legacy of British industrial might – and now a golden opportunity for transformation. Some, such as the Aldcliffe yard development in Lancaster, will see just a few expensive houses built on old industrial canal works but many seek to create large new “liveable” urban communities in what were some of the Britain’s polluted places, such as Wolverhampton, Leeds, Manchester, Lancaster, Glasgow, Liverpool and Birmingham.Together, they are removing some of the last vestiges of the dirty old industrial urban economy and steering cities towards a future based on inner-city living, retail, leisure and heritage.Middlewood Locks in Salford, Manchester, was the site of an iron-rolling mill, railway sidings and goods sheds. It is slated now to become Manchester’s “most vibrant” inner-city area: a £700m canalside development of homes to buy and rent, with shops, nurseries and gyms.Equally, Hale Wharf in Tottenham on the side of the Lee navigation in north London, was the site of furniture factories, gunpowder and timber stores. Soon it will have 500 houses in a “canalside realm”.Britain’s most ambitious development is probably the Icknield Port Loop development, two miles from Birmingham city centre, where a massive 43 acres (18 hectares) of land between two of Britain’s oldest canals has been cleared for a new neighbourhood of 1,100 houses, shops and leisure facilities. Old pictures show Port Loop at the height of the 19th-century industrial revolution with belching chimneys, wharfs, saw mills and glassworks, set among fields. The first new homes are now selling for £380,000 and up.Regeneration of the canals on this scale was barely imaginable even 50 years ago. Unless they moved goods around, canals were regarded by government as polluted ditches, good only to be drained or filled in. Only the largest canals had survived the car economy. Anyone who took a boat out on the inland waterways for pleasure was considered eccentric.Three things unexpectedly changed everything. A postwar infant canal leisure industry emerged dozens of passionate heritage charities like the Lapal trust voluntarily restored many of the old waterways and water proved to be the vital ingredient to kickstart a new, property-based canal mania.“The restoration of the canals in the 1950s and 60s was thanks to a remarkable act of defiance by unpaid volunteers against the authorities,” says canal historian Mike Clarke.“Volunteers were vital. It’s unlikely there would be many canals today without them. The government, many influential people, and the British Waterways board, were all happy to see the majority filled in. But the volunteers challenged them and started to restore them without any authority,” says Clarke. “They told the government, ‘if you want to complain, take us to court.’”Government dared not take on the small army of volunteers, co-ordinated by the stroppy, infant Inland Waterways Association, the charity that since 1946 has promoted the revival of the UK canal system and whose members gave up weekends and millions of hours of free labour to dig out, restore and lobby for the country’s 6,500 miles of canal.“People had more leisure time, better education made them interested in their history, and the small English canals which had remained virtually unaltered for 200 years were of an ideal size for pleasure boats,” Clarke says. “They formed isolated stretches of peaceful country within the urban environment. Planners eventually saw them as an asset, and government at last understood their potential for leisure.”Once the canals were cleaned up and restored by the volunteers, regeneration followed. By the 1990s public funding from Europe and Westminster was unlocking billions of pounds of private capital. The result was that those polluted urban ditches, blocked off from the public and often filled with shopping trolleys and waste, became the bright new modern face of central Manchester, Glasgow, Bradford, Gloucester, Birmingham, London and dozens of other cities.And just as canals linked cities and shaped the way they grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, they are now shaping urban renewal today. Canals have never been more popular, says the Canal and River Trust (CRT), the government-part-funded charity set up in 2012 to take over and manage the 2,000 miles of state-owned canal formerly run by British Waterways. It calculates that about 10 million people a year visit the canals to fish, walk, cycle, observe wildlife or go boating.“There are now more licensed boats using the canals than at the height of the industrial revolution,” says a spokeswoman.In addition, canals have become a real alternative for people unable or unwilling to buy city property. The 100 miles of canals that run through London are now lined with vessels, and the city, with around 4,000 boats lived on by possibly 10,000 people, is thought to have a larger permanent floating community than Amsterdam with its 3,000 houseboats.“Waterside developments often lead to a reduction in the provision of mooring space for boats. When the CRT sells canalside space to developers the moorings often go. They are creating moorings for businesses but not for people”, said a spokesman for the National Bargee Travellers Association.“There is an acute and chronic lack of basic facilities on London’s waterways such as potable water taps, waste disposal facilities (for domestic waste, recycling, chemical toilets and motor oil), landside toilets and landside showers. For example there are only 17 water taps, 10 chemical toilet disposal facilities and 10 rubbish bins in the CRT Greater London region,” said the NBTA.“The CRT is trying to force us off the water and turn the waterways into a money-making business”, said one boater in London, who asked not to be named.This is disputed by Joe Coggins of the CRT. “There has been no reduction in moorings, but in a few isolated places we have given up moorings. We work with developers to keep moorings available.”“This is a golden age for the canals. We welcome everybody on them. There has never been so much demand for moorings and we try to find a balance between those who want to move around and those who want permanent moorings. It’s an acute challenge in London.”Canal development may have changed the face of cities but the quality of building has been patchy. The Gas Street basin in Birmingham city centre, which is the hub of a labyrinth of 200-year-old canals, wharfs, quays and locks, is now a corporate honey-pot, with restaurants and bars, civic buildings, luxury flats and hotels.Yet a few miles away the Black Country canals of Wolverhampton, Dudley and Walsall see few boats. Many of these old waterways are lined with semi-derelict warehouses, recycling and scrap-metal yards, bottling plants and rusting industrial lifting gear.Outside prestige city centre developments, many canalside buildings have been built with little sensitivity to either heritage or environment, says Smedley. Developers, especially in the 1970s and 80s, tried to cram in as many identikit houses as they could, and the result has in some places been an architectural mess with poor quality housing aimed at young professionals rather than families or the old, and low environmental or heritage value, she says.“Not all developments can be said to be good. A lot could have been much better quality. It’s getting better but mistakes were certainly made,” says Smedley.“The golden age of canal restoration was 20 years ago. Around the millennium, around 200 miles of canal were restored, many with EU and government money. Many old routes were reopened, urban canals were developed, and new canals linking waterways constructed. Now the money has dried up. Our concern now is that urban sprawl along them will destroy the rural areas between cities,” she says.Canalside regeneration has often led to gentrification and the takeover of places by the affluent. Wigan Pier, the semi-derelict site on the 18th century Leeds-Liverpool canal which George Orwell made famous in his 1937 portrait of northern living conditions, is to be transformed. In place of Orwell’s tripe shops and pubs, the council and developers plan a “multi-leisure” complex of gated townhouses, delis, a food hall, and a gin distillery.Certainly, restoration mania has given rise to tensions between developers and old-guard canal-users, and volunteers with developers accused of taking advantage of their voluntary work, says Mike Clarke. “Sometimes developers do things on the cheap which can cause upset. They see people on boats as easy targets to make money, charging them excessively. Sometimes they don’t recognise the heritage value of the canals. But they accept that development must happen.”“Almost unnoticed, the canals have become important sanctuaries for urban and rural wildlife,” says Simon Atkinson, head of conservation at the Birmingham and Black Country Wildlife Trust. “They effectively form a huge linear national park and are incredibly important wildlife corridors, very high in ecological value. They are like long ponds.”Otters, water voles, kingfishers, ducks, herons, fish, dragon- and damsel flies, even rabbits, are seen on the 100-odd miles of Birmingham canals, some of which are classed as local nature reserves. “There is more wildlife on these canals than there is in many industrial farming landscapes. There has been dereliction on these canals since the 1880s. It has led to opportunities for wildlife to take hold,” Atkinson says.“But we are at a crossroads. Water pollution has been largely stopped but planning can be weak and some places have been developed terribly, allowing wildlife no access to the water, no open spaces.“If development is done well, it can enhance nature. The canals have never been more important, but it could go the other way. There is a real opportunity for high quality inner-city development and nature to flourish together.”Back in South Birmingham, work is preparing to start on the first stage of the Dudley canal. Where it was once the dream of a few passionate people interested in urban heritage, today it is regarded by the city as an important link between the industrial past and the leisure-based future.“Many people still have no idea that the old Dudley No 2 canal ever existed, let alone that Selly Oak was a hive of Victorian industry,” says Hugh Humphreys.Their surprise – and probable delight – when in a few years’ time they find canal boats motoring past Sainsbury’s supermarket at a stately 4mph, and see otters and kingfishers at the bottom of their gardens, may just be worth the 200-year wait.The canal revolution series looks at what our changing waterways reveal about modern British cities.

Plenty of the advice is useless, contradictory and mad, but if you want to live a peaceful, uneventful and rather dull life as a woman in the 21st century, you can get by if you use the following terms as broad instructions: “Don’t make a scene” and “midi dresses”.Men, on the other hand – hoo boy. My heart breaks for you all. We’re furious with you for failing to constantly acknowledge that you’re benefiting from centuries of systematic privilege. We’ve convinced ourselves that you’re all happy-go-lucky pay-gap profiteers who couldn’t describe a vacuum cleaner if it came up during a game of Articulate. If I’d never met a man in real life and only seen them on the news, I’d be convinced that no man had ever had the handle of a bag for life snap off in the bus queue or had an entire chocolate Digestive collapse in their tea. Whatever you’re doing, in 2019, we’re quick to tell you that you’re doing it wrong – but unlike women you don’t have an instructive legacy of completely insane advice to guide you. Where is your Goop? Who is your Elizabeth Gilbert, your Oprah? Your inspirational beacon is Jack from last year’s Love Island, a 28-year-old man who can’t be trusted not to spoil his dinner by ripping into three sharing bags of Doritos before he opens his Old El Paso kit.In spite of these clashes and contradictions, many men and women fall in love, and they plan to spend their lives together. Bafflingly, it’s usually left to the men to make this decision official. No one can come up with a good reason for this. It’s “traditional” – like the Eurovision song contest. It’s “romantic” – like a book about a teenage girl falling for a million-year-old vampire that likes to watch her sleep. It’s stupid. But in 2019, we still do it.If the tradition were flipped, and women were the ones who were expected to propose marriage, there would be no bad proposal stories. The rules would be rigid. We would be expected to have a list of proposal dos and don’ts tattooed inside our forearms. Instead of Say Yes To The Dress we would watch Make Him Say Yes – Or Else. However, men are on their own, because it’s manly. That way we can all be furious when they inevitably get it wrong.Edgaras Averbuchas is the latest bad proposer, following in the footsteps of Qin Kai, at the 2016 Olympics. Averbuchas proposed to his girlfriend Agne Banuskeviciute during her graduation ceremony at the University of Essex. She accepted, saying, “I think that this day became even more beautiful with this proposal.” However, the university has removed the video clip of the event from its website as it has received so much criticism. Cambridge University research associate Dr Jana Bacevic tweeted: “Imagine being a man and feeling so threatened by a woman’s intellectual success that you have to force her to frame her identityagency in relation to you on the very day she is being celebrated for her intellect.” Woman’s March organiser Aisha Ali-Khan said it “smacked of egotism”.I don’t think many people in their right mind would consider making a public proposal. The trouble is that when you are asking a terrifying question and making yourself extremely vulnerable to rejection, you’re not in your right mind. We assume the public proposers are manipulative wrong ’uns who are, at best, showboating – and at worst, using a form of coercive control and putting their partner in a position where they don’t feel they can say no. However, I suspect the majority are panicky idiots who simply want to experience the most frightening moment of their life in a safe space.Averbuchas knew that Banuskeviciute would probably be in a good mood, and that he’d be in a place where it would be relatively easy to get hold of some champagne afterwards. If the proposal was a maths test, I wouldn’t give him any marks for his conclusion, but he might get a point for showing flawed but consistent working.We need to acknowledge that when it comes to love and marriage, many of us are clinging on to outdated ideas and traditions that hurt men and women. Marriage is a partnership, and every party involved should enter it as an equal. It’s not fair on anyone when we assume it’s up to men to ask, and up to women to gratefully answer in the affirmative. When you’re choosing to spend the rest of your lives together, you should both spend a few months discussing it. It should be the first of many shared decisions. I don’t think the majority of heterosexual men are Christian Grey wannabes looking for women to control. I think they want to build lives with women who know themselves, respect themselves and are able to make split-second decisions during tricky moments in multistorey car parks.Ultimately it won’t matter how a proposal is executed when we get to the point where it doesn’t matter who is proposing. But if public proposals leave a bad taste in your mouth, we need to remember that they are a symptom of a society in which rigid gender rules ensure that everybody loses.“Will you marry me?” might sound like the perfect way to defuse your partner’s furious response to your first question: “Are you sure you need 8,000 tea lights?” Take a deep breath, open your mouth and fill it with meatballs instead.This could turn a Kafkaesque nightmare into a really special occasion, but as soon as that diamond goes on it will need to come off and into a mood-killing grey plastic tray.“Let’s choose a ring! I’ve budgeted for something in the £4-£6 range.”You will forever associate one of the most significant moments of your life with the scent of wet dog.It’s just not on. Unless you do it strategically. “Will you marry me? Now, I didn’t bring a present, so can yours be from both of us?”• Daisy Buchanan is a columnist and features writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d/0_87_3619_2171/master/3619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61cb438d777de5c8ff9f677a021c55b0","title":"dominic cummings no 10 nasa control centre adviser civil service","story":"Might one of Boris Johnson’s first acts as prime minister be to renovate the offices in No 10? According to his new senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, one simple way to improve the UK government is changing the spaces where decisions are made. If Cummings gets his way, out would go the polished wood tables, fireplace and ticking antique clocks. In would come banks of screens, predictive computer models and untested cognitive tools. Downing Street could look like more like a Nasa control centre than a stately home.And that’s not all he would change. Cummings has gone so far as to suggest one of his primary motivations for involving himself in Brexit was the once-in-a-half-century opportunity it would allow to fundamentally reform the British state. Over the years, he has repeatedly criticised Whitehall as achingly slow, blindly driven by the news cycle, staffed by ineffective conformists, oblivious to evidence, and out of touch with advances in technology. He thinks the civil service is staffed by “hollow men” who are incapable of thinking wisely about big problems and acting on them.So Cummings’s ideas about reforming government are bound to excite some and anger others. But to understand properly his vision of the future of government, it is best to take a sober look at his thoughts. He has some good ideas, but his vision for the future of government also has dangerous flaws.Since being the chief strategist behind Vote Leave, Cummings has withdrawn from public life to spend time reading and writing. His ideas about how to reform government can be found on his fascinating blog. In his most recent post, he outlines a range of solutions for transforming Whitehall. They include building high-performing teams, using forecasting tournaments, conducting “pre-mortems”, creating “red teams”, harnessing new data-visualisation techniques, utilising computational models and drawing on some recent thinking about mega-projects.Many of Cummings’s ideas for reform are good. His idea of running forecasting tournaments to make tough decisions is backed up by perhaps the best available recent study of forecasting out there. His suggestion of conducting pre-mortems by getting decision-makers to imagine the project they are working on has being a colossal failure is frequently used by everyone from fire-fighters to central bankers. His proposition of creating “red teams” that explicitly challenge the dominant point of view is also a great way to encourage an organisation to question its own assumptions.However many of Cummings’s ideas for civil service reform sound great on a blog but are likely to prove disastrous in practice. The first of these ideas is redesigning the space in which Whitehall decision-makers work. Cummings is keen on creating “seeing spaces” that resemble the control room of a nuclear power plant. These might look cool in an action film, but they will not be so cool in reality. Research on open-plan workspaces shows they are terrible. They make employees more stressed, less engaged, less productive, less likely to share ideas and more likely to act unethically and make bad decisions. Surrounding decision-makers with dozens of screens streaming real-time data will create a high-pressure environment where people are overloaded with information. If this happens, the quality of decisions generally deteriorates.It’s also worth remembering that a similar plan has been tried before. After Gordon Brown took over as prime minister, he visited Michael Bloomberg, who was then mayor of New York. During his visit, Brown was impressed by Bloomberg’s office. The mayor sat in the middle at a control desk and was surrounded by screens and advisers. On his return to London, Brown tried to replicate Bloomberg’s control centre in No 10. I suspect that this office redesign was one of the reasons behind Brown’s downfall. It meant the introverted prime minister was constantly surrounded by people and overwhelmed by information. This made him constantly on-edge, grumpy and increasingly indecisive.The second questionable idea Cummings has for civil service reform is a wholesale change in decision-making tools. Cummings thinks the stacks of papers, red boxes and PowerPoint slides are hopelessly outdated. New tools – such as real-time computer models – are needed. These models will give decision-makers a clear understanding of complex sources of data. But there is a significant danger that key staff will start to mistake their models for reality. If this happens, they will begin to overlook information not contained in their models and ignore the assumptions which are built in. This is what happened in many financial institutions before the 2008 crisis: bankers started to believe their own models and became blind to significant risks that were not included.The third questionable idea is his reliance exclusively on tight-knit teams of highly intelligent iniduals. Getting a small group of smart people to make key decisions seems reasonable. But such groups are often over-reliant on models and become disconnected from on-the-ground experiences. Furthermore, they typically make decisions with little consideration of the difficulties of implementation. One of Cummings’s touchstones for reforming the civil service is the Xerox Parc research institute during the 1970s. This invented such breakthroughs as the graphic user interface, laser printers and the ethernet. However, most of these ideas were never picked up within the company as the engineers at Parc were disconnected from the daily realities of the rest of the business.The idea that high-tech firms and hedge funds are the appropriate analogies for civil service reform is fraught with danger. Looking at Silicon Valley companies may bring in new ideas and cutting-edge practices. But it is based on a common mistake: what works in one sector will also work in another. Researchers have repeatedly found that this simply isn’t true. Cummings’s ideas about decision-making might work in sectors where processing data and pushing the right button is crucial. But in government, implementation of decisions is the crucial part. Having complex seeing-rooms staffed by super-smart people, all kitted out with the latest data-visualisation tools is unlikely to help government with the hard work of implementing its policies.• André Spicer is professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City, University of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2408299064a35e3e24617e01d590d25d00a4930/0_137_4115_2469/master/4115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d455f0cf700fcd0bd128dd6b7ec88846","title":"flipped burgers mcdonalds insubordination holiday job","story":"There was, I discovered on obtaining a holiday job at McDonald’s before embarking on A-levels, an immediate benefit and a simultaneous disbenefit. The benefit was that on joining and becoming a “crew member” you were given – free of charge – a uniform. The disbenefit was that, on each shift, you had to wear it. The trousers were capacious, the top deep blue and white with a stripy pattern. This, according to HR magazine , was Ronald McD’s attempt to utilise “primary colours and pin stripes, in line with the tailored feel of the power-suit.” But even with the boat-shaped hat that made you look like one of the Tracy family in Thunderbirds, there really wasn’t much power in that outfit. And it wasn’t much of a suit. No wonder people dressed at work or arrived in outsized overcoats.I learned several things quickly. One was that in work as in life, there is a role for everyone: the key is how to find it. I did shifts deep-frying Filet-O-Fishes and frozen fries in enormous wire baskets. And I learned the hurried synchronicity required to make sure there was always sufficient fodder, and the adaptability to accommodate customers who jolted a system rooted in homogeneity by ordering bespoke.I did hot and gruelling shifts cooking the burgers required for hamburgers, cheeseburgers and Big Macs. A few of those was enough. The man frying the regular burgers, and it was usually a burly, manly man, was like the stoker shovelling coal into the furnace of a steam engine fast enough to reach Manchester by sundown. It all seemed very Victorian: and to be honest, I was never very good at it. The proof was a shift spent cooking Quarter Pounders, which were thicker and needed searing on either side to cook them in the middle. One day I forgot and watched as eight unseared Quarter Pounders – each minus a hefty bite – were returned by queasy, irate customers. Presumably they stopped by en route to A\u0026ampE.From such days and such occurrences, I learned that it’s best to match one’s specific talents to every shared endeavour. It helped that I was raised in a family where chores were non-negotiable, especially for me, the youngest member. Clean the windows, hoover up, wash down the paintwork and skirting boards, wipe down the kitchen cupboards. These were the sort of things that had to be done before the weekend was my own. And so applying the fact that I had always worked to buy the things I wanted – starting with a paper round at 12 which morphed into a job with a chain of newsagents – and that I had no inherent fear of a mop or broom, I gravitated towards the shifts spent keeping tables and the restaurant clean and clearing the nearby streets of McDonald’s litter.Trash collection was a local authority stipulation and a top priority. Clean restaurants, meanwhile, reflected the company mantra: incanted, and reinforced in the exams we took to obtain shiny star-studded crew hierarchy badges: “quality, service, cleanliness”.It was within this structure that I quickly realised that so long as the visible objectives were achieved: no one much cared where I was or what I did or how I did it. This served me well. I wrote the  Diary for seven years and the modus operandi was much the same.Others at McD’s found a measure of autonomy but, as ever, some pushed the envelope further than it was meant to go. One crew member, bin liner in hand, famously departed on trash collection and was missing long enough for her absence to become an issue. She was found, bag in hand, emerging from the cinema.As underlings in an operation of strict rules and hierarchy, we enjoyed such acts of insubordination. Senior bosses seemed benign, but middle managers, the NCOs, could be disagreeable types with more power than they knew how to handle or deserved. Discomfiting them became a pastime, and one sure way to do that, as the 1970s came to a close, was to utter a sentence, a little too loudly, containing the word “union”. McDonald’s did not like unions. And we enjoyed the camaraderie that can make even harsh and stressful working environments tolerable.I learned something about right and wrong there, and perhaps a little about interventionism. Working the tills, I gleaned that it was unspoken practice to give police officers free food, on the basis that if there was trouble in the restaurant, they would quickly come to the aid of beleaguered staff. But despite the close proximity of a station and the ubiquity of police patrols, the response was always wanting. In the aftermath of one such failure, having filled several bags of burgers, fries and apple pies for the officer dispatched to collect them, I smiled a unknowing smile and said: “That will be £15.50”, and watched a perplexed figure return to the van outside to collect the cash from his colleagues.And for quite a while afterwards, I learned how to watch my back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ff58e6a8fe1d2e0a8bf20a402660b4d57d204f/119_0_3532_2121/master/3532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7685a5add68b2f3464f12ebe790caef","title":"forget gmt and bst set clock by love island time","story":"My teenage daughters run their lives by the ITV2 show – as long as it’s on, they are happyThere was a nasty incident in the road where my daughters live last week.Curtains twitched and ears were cocked in the direction of lots of shouting and screaming.

Listening to my girls’ description of all this, I found myself assuming the authoritative and businesslike tone of a crime reporter or private detective.“What time was it when you were first aware of this commotion?” They gave this some thought before one of them said, with a confirmatory nod from the other, “It was, like, Love Island time.”Good God, has it come to this? Is it now, like, an actual time of day? Or is it even a time zone of its own? BST, GMT, CET, LIT?

The rest is disposed of by being ploughed back into fields, composted or used to create energy.Peter Maddox, the director of Wrap, said the government-backed body’s detailed study had helped identify key sources of waste and would assist industry with resolving the issue.Sugar beet is most likely to be thrown away, with 347,000 tonnes wasted every year, according to the most recent data. But poultry accounts for the highest value of waste food at £85m in 2017, according to the report.“There is huge potential to reduce the amount of surplus and waste by promoting best practice, and that’s where our work is now focused. We want to increase redistribution of surplus food as has happened across the retail sector,” Maddox said.He said the body had set up a network to connect farmers and small-scale producers to identify new outlets for surplus food, including charities. Wrap is also working with farmers and retailers to improve guidance on setting quality standards, which farmers say are one of the main factors causing waste.Jack Ward, the chief executive of the British Growers Association, said understanding the scale of the waste problem that puts farmers’ profits under pressure was a positive step forward. “As the sustainability of our food production systems comes under increasing scrutiny, reducing waste at every point in the food supply chain will be an increasing priority,” he said.Large supermarkets and manufacturers have signed up to efforts to drive down the UK’s annual £20bn food waste bill by committing to halving waste from “farm to fork” by 2030.Last autumn, Wrap and the food and grocery charity IGD set a series of milestones for businesses to reduce waste at every stage of the supply chain. The annual bill for waste is equivalent to more than £300 for each citizen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d38ed7f085fdb08d5ab16970fb97d35eb4898622/124_40_862_517/master/862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28e0aee7a71884a538a24406a2fa899c","title":"marianne leonard words of love review nick broomfield documentary cohen ihlen","story":"Two love stories are explored in Nick Broomfield’s riveting documentary – the affair between Leonard Cohen and Marianne Ihlen, and one of his ownNick Broomfield’s riveting documentary gives us a vivid snapshot of the early 1960s and a complicated, mysterious love story. In this era, the poet and future music star Leonard Cohen fell in love with a beautiful and sensitive Norwegian woman called Marianne Ihlen on the stunning Greek island of Hydra and thought of her as his “muse”, inspiring songs such as So Long, Marianne and Bird on a Wire.Or maybe he fell in love with himself, with his own career and own celebrity, touring and travelling far away from Ihlen and having other affairs, while encouraging the “Marianne muse” legend as part of his melancholy mystique. The truth could lie between the two. Yet maybe this film is about a different love story, a third story of unexpressed love, as Broomfield reveals how, as a young man, he got to know Ihlen at about the same time, and became her friend and confidant in London in the years after that.The personalities involved could not have been more fascinatingly different: Cohen came from a cultured, refined and well-off Canadian family in Montreal and got his love of music from his charismatic mother Masha, who had a beautiful singing voice. At the beginning of the 60s, he found himself in Hydra in the pre-mass-tourist age. He had become mildly famous or notorious for his experimental novel Beautiful Losers, which he wrote on the island while ingesting huge amounts of drugs and hanging out with other bohemian expats.Ihlen lived there, married (with a child) to the writer Axel Jensen, and her relationship with the handsome and romantic Cohen grew out of a laidback attitude to monogamy. They had a passionate and apparently happy relationship, although as Ihlen is the non-famous (and very private) half of this story, it is difficult to excavate her feelings. But this is a drama about finding yourself — that well-known 60s trope. Ihlen found herself through emotional openness, and Cohen ecstatically found himself through switching from literature to music. It’s a dramatic example of an artist suddenly discovering what it was he was born to do.How things played out is revealed in the film by Cohen himself, in terms that inadvertently reveal that the relationship was always a bit semi-detached (on his part). He says that at first, he spent six months of the year in Hydra with Ihlen, and the other six months in Montreal. Then it was four months a year, then two months, then two weeks as his career took off.How in any case did Ihlen feel about being his “muse” – a designation that now reeks of insufferable male rock-star entitlement? (Some have accused the film of endorsing this attitude: I disagree.) Cohen is quoted speaking with sublime naivety about the sexual politics of the age. He speaks of friendships expressed sexually, and that he was very “fortunate” because it was the 60s and there was “cooperation”. Well, yes, maybe, although Cohen might not have noticed how one-sided this co-operation was and, anyway, his drug intake may have prevented him from noticing very much. It was, at all events, indiscreet of him to reveal that his song Chelsea Hotel No 2, about a woman “giving me head on the unmade bed  While the limousines wait in the street” was about Janis Joplin. How Marianne felt about that is not recorded.There is tenderness and delicacy in how Broomfield addresses himself to the subject of Ihlen’s life in the years when Cohen’s career was taking off: she finally returned to Norway and, in the late 1970s, married a nice, sensible man.Marianne Ihlen emerges as someone of enormous gentleness and dignity, even coming to one of the huge concerts that Cohen did in his old age when he was enjoying a huge second wave of popularity: there is moving footage of her in the front row, singing along. I think he sentimentally and self-indulgently cordoned off in his mind that period of sunlit sensual specialness with Ihlen, vacuum-sealed in plastic like a new LP. As to what she thought, Broomfield leaves it for us to decide.• Marianne and Leonard: Words of Love is released in the UK on 26 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e974da635a3e438281f1326a159d43a6b19261/0_108_2062_1237/master/2062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e8695573fe5cbd64b989a47ac45fe9","title":"rutger hauer from blade runner to buffy the vampire slayer in pictures","story":"The Dutch actor, who has died aged 75, had a long career playing – mostly – villains and ne’er-do-wells, but his charisma and force was always apparent•Peter Bradshaw on Rutger Hauer: an icily elegant presence with a touch of self-aware drollery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aabcff95b0da20620ec523b5e75db3db23877c04/21_62_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f29b307aa822e1264c3891fe1a4fb7b9","title":"everton moise kean juventus ademola lookman rb leipzig","story":"• Juventus want buy-back clause in any deal for forward• Ademola Lookman leaves Everton for RB LeipzigEverton have made an inquiry about signing Moise Kean from Juventus, who are willing to sell the forward for €40m (£35.7m) if a buy-back clause is inserted.Everton sold Ademola Lookman to RB Leipzig for an undisclosed fee on Thursday and would like to make Kean, a 19-year-old Italy international, a marquee summer signing.The clubs are due to open talks to establish whether a deal can be struck.

For the 1979 version of Twitter – presumably just people shouting in the street – this story must have trended. Football fans don’t like change, and a hifi manufacturer on the front of a pure red Liverpool kit, while everyone else was clear and unbranded, must have hurt.Without radio phone-ins people must have written angry letters somewhere, or worse, actually spoken to each other about it face to face. Was this the first moment where someone claimed “the game’s gone”? You can just imagine Steve in Birkenhead claiming this was “the tip of the iceberg … soon Toblerone will sponsor the ball and change its shape and the game won’t be gone, it will be WELL AND TRULY gone”. The game has gone many times since, now it goes on a weekly basis – yet it still seems to be here.In fact, Kettering Town had already broken the mould three years earlier. On 24 January 1976, they took to the field with “Kettering Tyres” emblazoned across their shirts for a game against Bath City in the Southern League. Their chief executive Derek Dougan had done a four-figure deal, much to the annoyance of the FA who told him to remove them. The FA had banned shirt sponsorship in 1972. Doogan tried to pull a fast one by changing the logo to “Kettering T” – claiming the T was for Town rather than Tyres, but he had no such luck. Nevertheless the FA wilted from pressure from other clubs and lifted the ban in 1977. Forty years later and Liverpool’s deal with Standered Chartered is worth around £40m for this season alone – although given that £40m can only get you four-fifths of Sean Longstaff, perhaps sponsorship hasn’t grown as wildly as you might imagine.This month the big sponsorship story has been Huddersfield Town. The club joined with the bookmakers Paddy Power to release a kit with a hen-do sized sash down the middle of their strip. It was hideous. As a publicity stunt it worked a dream – social media meltdown, the FA contacting the club, before the big reveal of a sponsorless shirt. That happened a day or two earlier than planned because the club were getting worried about the adverse publicity.There is clearly a serious issue with the amount of gambling in football. As Rob Davies reported last week, half of Premier League shirts will have a betting company’s logo this season – with 17 of the 24 Championship clubs following suit. To give Paddy Power and GVC, which owns Ladbrokes some credit, if that’s allowed, they have called for an end to shirt sponsorship deals – the former also won’t advertise on perimeter hoardings at grounds. Clearly they know what they’re doing – throwing the gauntlet down to less well known gambling firms to follow suit – and they can get their publicity in other ways. But if it means kids see less of it, along with no whistle to whistle gambling ads on TV that comes into place this year, that is a positive.The industry bankrolls not only football clubs, but all parts of the game. I have done radio phone-ins on gambling addiction, thanking callers for devastating personal accounts of their addictions before throwing to an ad break filled with odds, offers, accas and free bets. The single biggest problem the addicts told me was that some firms would not leave them alone, even after cancelling all their accounts. It is a competitive market, but surely there is enough to go round while letting the most vulnerable deal with their problems with the space they need. I don’t write from a lofty perch here. I like gambling, even if I only lose about a hundred quid a year betting on long shots in the golf majors. I have worked for gambling companies in the past.Since the Huddersfield “unsponsoring” announcement, Newport County and Motherwell have followed suit. And while the kits look good, there’s a nostalgia to sponsors that I’m not sure I want to lose. It’s how I remember kits. As a kid, I didn’t know the difference between a sponsor and a kit manufacturer. As far as I knew from all my extensive Panini ’87 swap deals, AVCO made West Ham kits and WANG Oxford. Everton were NEC and Arsenal were JVC. Perry Groves recounted this week how the players got half-price TVs from the deal. He would buy a load and sell them to his mates – cost price, not for profit!I remember seeing an advert with Jeff Goldblum drinking Holsten Pils and my brain completely failing to work out the connection between that and Tottenham Hotspur. I didn’t know who Jeff Goldblum was. I didn’t really know what beer was. And I couldn’t for the life of me link that to the glorious Hummel Holsten late-80s Glenn Hoddle kit. I am a sucker for those chevrons.I remember the unbridled joy of getting the full Spurs kit and proudly wearing it for about four weeks solid. It was the Gascoigne, Lineker Holsten – chevrons down the shorts too. I spent the late-80s and early-90s entirely dressed in Spurs and Cambridge. I don’t have a clue who designed the Cambridge ones but the sponsors are etched on my mind, from Lynfox to Howlett, then as we went up the leagues Fujitsu – a foreign company! Since then we have returned to steel works and skip manufacturers – proper League Two sponsors. All the way through I couldn’t tell you who actually designed them – until now. We have chevrons.Perhaps the greatest kits of them all are unsponsored. Barcelona – until they went nice with Unicef and then gear changed to Qatar – Denmark ’86, Brazil 1970. Things of real beauty. If I had one hope for this season, it’s that teams wear their home shirt whenever they can. The unnecessary use of third kits might be good for marketing, but really the game is “well and truly gone” if Liverpool choose to run around looking like 11 Stabilo orange marker pens when they could be in red.Was there a better kit spectacle than the Copa América final this summer? Two sides, in their classic kits – the yellow and blue of Brazil versus the sash of Peru. That is a sash everyone can get behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c1c939238a00ee6c618f72d5e9f313b6b0f5ab9/83_0_1193_716/master/1193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4735255c867303fa9a296240866ce29","title":"ethiopia university using drama to bridge ethnic divides","story":"Ethiopia’s conflicts are reflected at universities but, by walking in each other’s shoes on stage, students learn to do so in lifeRainy season has begun in Ethiopia’s south. On a stormy morning at a university in the town of Wolkite, students are using drama to break down entrenched ethnic barriers.Understanding between groups is a rarity in a country where violent conflict is common. Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, has promised greater stability, but tensions remain high in various regions and the education system is no more immune to deep-rooted tribal differences than anywhere else.Wolkite University has struggled with ethnic disputes between students since it was first established six years ago. The institution attracts young people from all over the country, who pay an average fee of 12,000 Ethiopian birr (£330) a year for tuition, food and board. With more than 80 ethnic groups and languages spoken in Ethiopia, the population of almost 15,000 students can struggle to find common ground.“There are clashes constantly,” says Asteway Mellese, who lectured at Wolkite University for four years. “For instance, if two students fight over a girl, if they are not from the same ethnic group, it will turn into an ethnic conflict and the next day there will be a mass fight buildings will be set on fire and there will be chaos in the university. When they play soccer, they may have a small collision but if they are from different ethnic groups it becomes an ethnic fight.”One such clash occurred during last year’s “culture day”, an annual event for which students are encouraged to wear their traditional dress and play traditional music. An Amhara student and an Oromo student got into a physical fight over whose music should be played first.“Students were injured. There were tensions across the university for days just because of playing a song first and second,” says Mellese.Language is another source of ethnic tension. It is national law that all universities teach in “neutral” English, although many lecturers are not sufficiently fluent and will supplement their lessons with Amharic, Ethiopia’s official working language. Last year, Oromo students in freshman year went on strike, demanding that they be taught in Oromo.“They were throwing stones at windows, stopping classes forcefully, threatening violence and death to the lecturers who were trying to teach,” says Mellese. “They tried to burn down buildings – it was a disaster. They stopped learning for two weeks.”The problems are so severe that students from different regions no longer share dormitories. “We don’t mix them any more because they would kill each other,” Mellese says. “They don’t speak the same language and they only want to speak their own language because it is ‘the best’ and their identity is ‘the best.’”Mellese believes this conviction of superiority stems from “this government bringing ethnic federalism to Ethiopia. The government preached: ‘Your group is special and the rest are not special.’” Since 1995, land rights and political representation have been tied to ethnic identity rather than Ethiopian citizenship, often leading to a bloody struggle for supremacy.To tackle these issues, Mellese devised a theatre course that promotes indigenous research and performance. The goal is to improve understanding and respect between cultures.One module requires students to carry out two weeks of field research on a particular ethnic group. “They will be exposed to their food, culture, language and particular issues,” says Mellese. “It’s very interesting and important for the students they understand how people in the rest of the country are living.” This research forms the basis for students to create a play that is performed before the entire university. Some of the plays are selected for national theatre festivals and broadcast on national television.Yitbarek Alebachew, a second-year theatre student from Awassa, where the Sidama people are the dominant group, spent two weeks studying Gurage culture in Wolkite. “Indigenous performance reflects the emotions of the nation and the community through the process of traditional folk dance and singing,” he says. “I am able to learn the Gurage culture, which has inspired the characters in the play I have written. It is a love story. Before the wedding there is a fight, after which the meaning of true love in that culture is shown.”Alebachew believes theatre creates a deeper level of understanding. “It is very powerful,” he says. “We learn through humour and performance. It’s better than PowerPoint presentations or paper.”Abule Debebe, a theatre and radio production lecturer at Wolkite, agrees: “Yitbarek knows the culture of the Sidama people but through indigenous performance he has learnt about the Gurage people. When he performs, their culture becomes his culture. When he goes back to Awassa, he can be an ambassador for his culture and the Gurage culture.”Mellese and Debebe have both seen a change among students studying the course. “After they took this course, they increased their tolerance and respect for their own and other ethnic groups,” says Debebe. Wolkite’s indigenous theatre syllabus has since been adopted by three other universities elsewhere in the country: Mekelle, Adigrat and Aksum.Progress has undoubtedly been made at Wolkite, but across the country violent conflict and mass displacement is causing misery for millions. “It is important for the government to understand the power of culture and use it to establish relationships for the common good rather than to ide,” says Debebe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e2f07ab55983fd0ca011cdd0d6f150943aa7cbc/0_0_6240_4160/master/6240.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cb74068f3d32d5c267ccd3509bd6555 1010w","title":"hotels booking money taken deposit authorisation","story":"Hotels information assured us that nothing would be charged at this pointI used hotels to book an aparthotel in France.

Other banks are expected to announce higher headline rates over the coming months.Why are overdrafts being overhauled?The Financial Conduct Authority said in June 2019 that it was introducing a raft of measures to fix the UK’s “dysfunctional” overdraft market. It said consumers “cannot meaningfully compare or work out the cost of borrowing as a result of complex and opaque charges”. Costs vary dramatically. Unauthorised overdrafts can be hideously expensive: the FCA said the typical cost of going just £100 into the red without permission was £5 a day – which the regulator expects to fall to less than 20p a day as a result of its changes.What is the solution?The regulator is simplifying and standardising the way banks charge for overdrafts. For example, it is banning them from charging higher prices for unauthorised overdrafts than for authorised ones. And it will require everyone to price overdrafts using a simple annual interest rate.Will it work?The problem is that with one-size-fits-all solutions, there are always winners and losers. PricewaterhouseCoopers recently warned: “The potential loss of income these rules create … could lead to firms seeking to make up their losses through higher arranged overdraft rates, loss of interest-free buffers, additional current account charges or tighter lending criteria.” The FCA has accepted some of this – for example, it said it recognised that “those with heavier use of arranged overdrafts may pay more than at present”. But at the same time, vulnerable consumers – some of whom, said the FCA, were disproportionately hit by excessive charges for going into the red without permission – will almost certainly see their borrowing costs fall.Nationwide is the first major provider to respond to the FCA’s clampdown announced in June, which the regulator said would “make overdrafts simpler, fairer, and easier to manage”.The FCA announced it would be stopping banks from charging higher prices for unauthorised overdrafts than for authorised ones, banning fixed daily or monthly charges for borrowing in this way, and requiring banks to price overdrafts using a simple annual interest rate.The FCA said the current overdraft market was “dysfunctional” and “causing significant consumer harm”. There are 26 million UK overdraft users, and they are a huge cash cow for banks, which made more than £2.4bn from them in one year alone (2017).Authorised overdraft costs vary hugely and are often baffling – some banks impose daily fees, some charge monthly fees, some charge interest on the amount owed, and some use a combination of these. Unauthorised overdrafts can be punishingly expensive.That is almost double the 24p in interest that someone with a FlexAccount borrowing £500 for one day on an arranged basis would pay now. However, based on this scenario, those holding Nationwide’s FlexDirect or FlexPlus account are currently charged 50p a day.The society is also scrapping the £250 fee-free buffer offered on FlexPlus authorised overdrafts, and said there would be additional text alerts to help members manage their money.In June the FCA appeared to predict the steps taken by Nationwide, and those likely to be taken by other banks and building societies, when it said its shakeup “could create winners and losers, as firms would be likely to seek to recover lost overdraft revenue from within their overdraft offering by, for example, increasing arranged overdraft prices and reducing interest-free buffers”.It added that it was particularly concerned about the welfare of vulnerable consumers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66a578048a9e9c9c6bd33e839f7bcc29c626ed9d/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75ad7c1ccafb3726e22027913c24f463","title":"mercury prize 2019 1975 dave foals idles shortlisted","story":"This years often politically inclined nominees also include Black Midi, Foals, Slowthai and jazz collective SEED EnsembleIn large part political and pessimistic in worldview, the albums nominated for this year’s Mercury prize could be interpreted as a treatise on Brexit Britain. They variously contain furious defences of the NHS, existential rage at the news cycle, indictments of online connection, despair at the shortcomings of the British penal system and tributes to the victims of the Grenfell fire.Unsurprisingly, punk is well represented in a list containing a striking number of first-time nominees: Irish band Fontaines DC are nominated for Dogrel, Bristol’s Idles for Joy As an Act of Resistance, London’s Black Midi for their Rough Trade debut, Schlagenheim, and Northampton rapper Slowthai for Nothing Great About Britain.Slowthai also leads a strong showing for British rappers: Dave is nominated for his debut album, Psychodrama, and Little Simz receives her first Mercury nod for her third studio album, Grey Area.This year’s nominations also contain repeat nominations for Foals, up for their third Mercury prize with Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost, and a second for the 1975, for A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships.British guitarist Anna Calvi has been nominated for her third album, Hunter, putting her among a select group of artists – Wolf Alice, Amy Winehouse, Savages, Laura Mvula and Michael Kiwanuka – to have seen each of their albums nominated for the prestigious award.The list is completed by Welsh post-punk songwriter Cate Le Bon with her fifth album, Reward, London funk songwriter Nao for her second album, Saturn, and 10-piece collective SEED Ensemble for debut Driftglass.Comprising noted young London players including tuba player Theon Cross, trumpeter Sheila Maurice-Grey and tenor saxophonist Chelsea Carmichael, the group fulfil the prize’s traditional lone jazz nomination. Last year’s jazz act Sons of Kemet were hotly tipped to win the prize, but lost to Wolf Alice for their second album, Visions of a Life.This year’s shortlist eschews some notable British albums from the past 12 months: records by James Blake, Florence + the Machine, former winner Skepta – who beat David Bowie’s final album to the prize in 2016 – rapper AJ Tracey, guitarist Nilüfer Yanya, songwriter Lucy Rose, chart behemoth Lewis Capaldi and avant-garde duo These New Puritans might all have expected nominations.Metal is also traditionally under-recognised – breakout metal group Employed to Serve and Bring Me the Horizon would have been eligible – as is electronic music, with no mention of producer Objekt’s acclaimed 2018 album Cocoon Crush nor the Cinematic Orchestra’s To Believe.It is the 28th year of the prize, which this year welcomes five new judges to the committee: Radio 1’s Annie Mac, former Supergrass frontman Gaz Coombes, R\u0026ampB star Jorja Smith, Glastonbury headliner Stormzy and Vice UK editorial director and  contributor Tshepo Mokoena.Albums by British and Irish artists with a UK release date between 21 July 2018 and 19 July 2019 were eligible for nomination, and more than 200 were submitted.

With the Democratic Unionist party’s continued support – and this is still to be formalised – Johnson has a working majority of three. This is likely to be eroded further next week, with the Liberal Democrats tipped to take the Brecon and Radnoshire seat from the Tories in a byelection. With the Lib Dems confident of attracting a Conservative defector or two (though nothing is certain) it is perfectly feasible that Johnson could return from the summer recess with no majority at all.The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. A complete clearout of May’s remain-minded ministers provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May’s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy – something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspwasn’t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn’t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn’t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the ‘Gaukward squad’ of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters – especially Tory members – will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider – during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May’s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care the future of the NHS a climate emergency the increasingly insecure future of work a broken housing market rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.Critics might say this is Johnson’s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor – an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers – Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 – a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his adopting the acronym \u0027Dude\u0027 in his victory speech shows just how hard it is for him.\u0026nbspIt all depends, and a number of factors would come into play. Labour has promised to call a formal vote of no confidence in a Johnson government, but will wait until it has the best chance of winning. Under the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, if a motion saying “this house has no confidence in Her Majesty’s government” is passed, there is a 14-day period in which the government can demonstrate it does have support via a confidence motion, or a new administration is formed, or there is an election. An election would not happen immediately, and even if a no-confidence vote were passed immediately after the summer, the earliest possible polling day would be Thursday 24 October.The party is expected to call one, but with the recess starting this afternoon it will need to wait until September. Labour had thought about an immediate no-confidence vote but calculated that even die-hard Johnson sceptics on the Tory benches would want to give him more than a day in office before kicking him out. But even if the working majority evaporates over the summer there is no guarantee it would pass, with ex-Conservatives having to weigh up if they would want to vote with Labour, thus triggering an election that could bring in a Jeremy Corbyn government.That also seems distinctly possible, and if there is a seeming uptick in the Conservative poll ratings Johnson could strike. His administration is certainly a campaign-focused one, packed with Vote Leave alumni both in the cabinet seats and among the backroom staff. But at the same time, this cabinet is seemingly not one intended to appeal beyond the ultra-leaversTory faithful, so an election could be a gamble.Some more misty-eyed MPs – mainly Lib Dems or Corbyn-sceptic Labourites – like to imagine a scenario where Johnson loses the confidence of the Commons, but rather than an election there emerges from the chaos some Borgen-like government of national unity, taking in Conservative and Labour moderates, along with the Lib Dems, SNP and others. This seems a tough ask – it would involve large numbers of MPs leaving party structures they have been part of for decades – but many strange political things have happened recently."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/276f442ef211d2dcafe06529728fa5fac21ed8c9/0_220_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33b5cdea1ecaa8a94b291fbdefd19af7","title":"share your experiences of netball","story":"Following New Zealand winning the Women’s Netball World Cup, we would like to hear your stories of playing the sportThe world of women and sport is rapidly changing.

As a result, the meeting is not expected to attract a large attendance but the change to its start time has still presented some logistical problems.Paul Johnson, the BHA’s head of racing, said that the regulator is “grateful for the understanding of trainers, jockeys, owners and stable staff regarding the change of start time for this fixture. The welfare of all our participants must come first and, as the only jump fixture on a day when temperatures are due to get very high, we have taken this precautionary step in the interests of the health and wellbeing of our horses.”Southwell has been watering the track in recent days and will continue to do so ahead of Thursday’s fixture, for which the going on both the chase and hurdle courses is currently good. The seven-race card attracted 53 declared runners at the overnight stage and admission for racegoers who turn up on the day is £10.Temperatures are forecast to reach the low 30s during the afternoon’s Flat card at Sandown Park, while the meeting at Yarmouth, within sight of the sea, is expected to take place in – relatively – cooler conditions with a peak temperature of 29C. There are also evening meetings at Newbury (first race 4.55) and Doncaster (5.45).All of Thursday’s courses held meetings during last summer’s extended heatwave and so have experience of coping with unusually hot conditions, but were still sent a reminder earlier this week by the Race Course Association of the issues that need to be addressed.A stayers’ handicap for three-year-olds is the most valuable event on the card at Sandown this afternoon and it promises to be quite a test on what is expected to be the hottest day in Esher for many a year. But it also offers an obvious candidate for the best bet of the day, as William Haggas’s Space Walk (2.50) can make his handicap off a mark of 80, when the time and style of his win at Haydock in June might have pointed to something closer to 90.To be fair to the handicapper, that was only a five-runner race and Space Walk got home by less than a length after making all the running. The time, though, was very strong and Space Walk showed real grit to hold on for victory. With an extra quarter-mile this afternoon all but certain to see further improvement, his current odds of around 6-4 are perfectly fair.The six runners in the Listed contest for juveniles at 2.15 have won seven of their combined 10 starts so an informative race is in prospect. The market seems confident that Walk In Marrakesh and Light Blush are the two to focus on but Ursulina (2.05) may have been overlooked after a six-length defeat by Summer Romance last time. That may say more about the winner – who went straight to the top of the market for next year’s 1,000 Guineas – than it does the runner-up and Tom Dascombe’s filly, a 7-1 shot today, is not one to write off yet. Eligible (4.25) should also go well at the same meeting, while Sweet Forgetme Not (2.05) and Fantom Force (6.30) stand out on the cards at Yarmouth and Newbury respectively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976e0809f57fd991b12f3cff0519ef2d2c767a75/0_206_3875_2325/master/3875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=328412a1bd274be18b0004dc06e5bb74","title":"england v ireland lords test day two live","story":"30th over: England 122-1 (Leach 60, Roy 52)  Adair’s suncream has somehow survived the scorch of the morning, splodged over his face like two pantomime slapped cheeks. A well-earned maiden finishes off his spell and that really is lunch. Scores are level. And where ten wickets fell yesterday morning, only one has gone today. The England batsmen are applauded into the pavilion by shirt-sleeved members and a hot looking balcony of fellow players. England’s morning, with maiden Test fifties of differing styles for both Roy and Leach. Time for me to grab a quick glass of water, and the Irish bowlers to lie down in darkened room. See you in forty minutes!29th over: England 122-1 (Leach 60, Roy 52) Roy drives sweetly for a couple , then wristily, powerfully, through point for a first Test fifty. He raises his bat to the dressing room. My helpful school-holiday side kick tells me that James Taylor mouthed to Ed Smith “47 balls.” Scores level.28th over: England 115-1 (Leach 59, Roy 46) Jack Leach has impressive sang-froid. Not the most glamorous, nor the most stylish, and batting opposite one of the most destructive cricketers in the world, he chops McBrine for three without a care and the numbers build. At this rate, England will be evens by lunch. They currently trail by seven. Ah, Matt Hill has the answer to Labour’s biggest cricket fan. “It was Clem Attlee (over 21). He is said to have refused to have a ticker-tape news machine in No. 10 until he was told it would contain live cricket scores. When it reported on the resignation of Nye Bevan, Attlee reportedly asked: “Why is my cricket machine leaking Cabinet secrets?”27th over: England 109-1 (Leach 56, Roy 43) Thompson again, I’m feeling for the bowlers out there, it is hot enough sitting still with a lap top on my knee. Roy and Leach play carefully for lunch, nudge, nudge. Thank you to Robert Wright for this fascinating bit of insider political knowledge: “This is a boring, political nerd point but one that strikes me because I’ve been working in parliament reporting on this week’s momentous events. The Theresa May picture could be of genuine political significance because of the other people in the picture. The person in the middle of the row behind is David Gauke, who was until yesterday justice secretary, and who has given his name to the “Gaukeward squad” of disaffected departed cabinet ministers who are expected to agitate against a no-deal Brexit. On the left of the picture is Greg Clark, another Remainer-ish MP who was forced out of the Cabinet yesterday. There has been speculation about whether Mrs May might join the Gaukeward squad. The picture suggests that, for cricket-watching purposes at least, she’s already in.”26th over: England 106-1 (Leach 55, Roy 41) McBrine gets the honour of the last over before lunch. Roy dispatches a top-edged sweep for four and that isn’t lunch actually. England are suddenly only 16 runs behind and the pendulum has swung. 25th over: England 99-1 (Leach 55, Roy 34)  Roy is hit on the back pad and there’s a huge appeal by Thompson. The Irish players look at each other, scratch their chins and run out of time. A sharp drive over the top of a leaping extra-cover for four follows, and Roy moves crisply on, out-scored by his nightwatchman but looking in ominously sharp form.Simon McMahon has the right idea: “Morning Tanya. As the mercury pushes up towards 40 degrees in London, it’s a pleasant 24°C here on the east coast of Scotland, and I’m imagining being at Lord’s by opening a bottle of champagne in my garden and following the OBO. If I half close my eyes, it’s like I’m there, honest. Although I don’t think they have a washing line in the middle of the outfield at Lord’s, do they?”I love, 24 degrees. The optimum temperature. Summer dress with a cardie on hand. 24th over: England 94-1 (Leach 55, Roy 29) Leach charges down the wicket, twinkle-toed and lofts McBrine over midwicket for four. With a bounce it is over the rope. Glorious!21st over: England 71-1 (Leach 43, Roy 18) Stuart Thompson gets the ball for the first time this morning and starts off on his long run. His Thursday wasn’t as good as some others, he left a juicy straight one and was bowled for a duck. But that was yesterday, and today starts with five dots then a shot of some glorious genius from Jack Leach for four. Here is Theresa May at Lord’s . I’m pretty sure John Major headed to The Oval to watch Surrey after handing in his resignation to the Queen. But has any Labour former PM turned to cricket for immediate solace?23rd over: England 89-1 (Leach 51, Roy 28) Many apologies, for some reason the last two overs of OBO have completely disappeared in a rather major technical hitch. Leach and Roy are still here - Roy has whalloped a six.Leach’s goes to his maiden fifty with an edge off Thompson through second slip! And with it he becomes the first fifty for an England bespectacled batsman since Paul Allott20th over: England 71-1 (Leach 43, Roy 18) A hot looking Murtagh rolls through the paces for his eighth over of this hot, hot day. Just a couple for Roy from a leg-side punch - though he would have had more had a hearty drive not charged straight into the non-striker’s stumps. We see James Taylor and Ed Smith in matching ironed blue shirts, in the shade, pondering their moves for next week. And that’s drinks. But while we swelter, the rest of Europe swelters even more. David Harland is continental Europe where he smells a conspiracy theory in a heat haze.I am currently enjoying the OBO as my only way to connect with this increasingly perverse test match whilst enduring sweltering heat in Switzerland for work.Am I alone in thinking the the powers at be at Lords must form part of a plot to enable the ECB to say to all the 4 day test naysayers that this Test format was a good idea after? In preparing a wicket that sees 20 Test wickets in a single day they must at least be trying to do someone a favour. Obviously the same person the English batsmen all owe money too as well....19th over: England 69-1 (Leach 43, Roy 16) Jack Leach reaches up to his tip-toe height and plays a perfect high-elbowed defensive prod to Boyd Rankin. Geoffrey would be proud. He potters back down the pitch to prod again at whatever it is he prods at. A maiden. Half an hour to lunch.18th over: England 68-1 (Leach 43, Roy 16) Just one from Murtagh’s over. Paul Frangi is experiencing heat-induced time travel:”Good grief, Tom Stobbs has just given me horrible flashbacks from the 1993 Ashes series. Lathwell was like a rabbit in the headlights.”Having just read Rob Smyth’s (excellent) book on Robin Smith, and the kind of environment Test cricket was played in, I can’t imagine the dressing-room was any place for introverts. Poor Lathwell, I like to hope anyone like him would have a better time now. 17th over: England 67-1 (Leach 42, Roy 16) Rankin charges in in the broiling heat. Jack Leach, lumpy side (?) guard bulking out his whites like a hidden library book, drives the first ball and they come through for a quick two. Some welcome quiet thenAfternoon TanyaI have been thinking.. victory for Ireland is for the greater good of Test cricket (also it’s gonna be a great story.. how the Irish brought the World Champions crashing down to earth..)Victory for England means a confidence booster before the Aussies stride into town next week.A conundrum, if ever there was one.A happy conundrum I reckon.16th over: England 65-1 (Leach 40, Roy 16) Roy steps largely down the pitch, misses the ball and might have been stumped had Wilson been standing up. Then he is beaten by a Murtagh beauty with a wobble seam. But light relief off the last ball, an uppish cover-drive for four. 15th over: England 61-1 (Leach 40, Roy 12) Roy edges Rankin through the slips for four. An awkward shot, he tries to whallop through mid-wicket but ends up edging through third man. Breathe man, breathe! Rankin nips back through Leach’s defences and just over the stumpsTheresa May is apparently at Lord’s today, with selected members of her recently-culled cabinet. Ronald Grover writes: “Tanya, how about cabinets as international sides? Theresa May’s probably a mid-80s New Zealand? The current one a rebel tour to South Africa? It’s all too depressing, I know”14th over: England 56-1 (Leach 40, Roy 8) Things are getting tricky, so Ireland go back to Murtagh and relentless accuracy. Leach hammers down on the pitch with his bat, tap, tap, but he just nurdles two off the over.Tom Stobbs has been studying bats with a detailed eye: “Great to see Jack Leach has solved the opener dilemna, but even better to see a Millichamp \u0026amp Hall bat in test cricket. Reminds me of Mark Lathwell.”13th over: England 54-1 (Leach 38, Roy 8) Jack Leach hadn’t reached double figures in first-class cricket this season. But he hits Rankin for two successive fours - a little drive that just scampers away from the chasing fielders and bombastic drive through the covers. Ireland appeal to the umpires for a misshapen ball: they consider it, but no cigar. My my, and another, this time Leach tips Rankin off his hip for four more. Mark White in Sydney says the secret words: “Can I be the 500th person to say England has found its ideal second opener - Leach! You’re welcome.”12th over: England 41-1 (Leach 25, Roy 8) Adair continues from the pavilion end. Oh and that’s a beautiful shot through extra-cover from Jack Leach for four. And with a replica shot, though not quite as well-timed, he moves on to the highest England score in the match. Roy is off the mark with a click and a slightly off-centre off-drive for four. He has another throw of the bat next ball - this feels slightly too hasty. Having said that, he strokes a perfect, gorgeous cover drive off the last ball of the over. Fifteen from it. Sam Collier writes from the Shetlands: “Re Tom’s comment at 10:52, I was going to email yesterday about how Ollie Stone’s picture on Cricinfo makes him look like three of the Inbetweeners, rolled disturbingly into one. I cannot now unsee it.”11th over: England 26-1 (Leach 18, Roy 0) England had done the hard stuff, seen off Murtagh after forty minutes of disciplined, accurate 70-something mphers. Boyd Rankin replaced him at the nursery end, bounced Leach, was cut for four before suckering Burns into his trap. Roy walks out to two slips a gully and a short leg. Oh and they took drinks as the wicket fell. The change of bowling works! Burns’s 26 ball mini marathon is finished when he pushes forward awkwardly, feathers an edge and is caught behind10th over: England 21-0 (Leach 13, Burns 6) This is attritional . England are rightfully wary, and Ireland aren’t giving them anything to play with. Burns pushes and prods and is beaten outside off stump by a beauty of an Adair outswinger. Another maiden. Shankar Mony is in mischievous mood. “Now that Leach has reached 11, is it right to point out that he has a better average as opener than Roy?”9th over: England 21-0 (Leach 13, Burns 6) Murtagh wipes his forehead with his forearm as the mercury creeps up to 33 degrees. I spot parasols and fans in the crowd - a sign of this new climate reality. Leach wriggles and shuffles his way through five balls of the over much to the frustration of Ireland. Burns picks up three through square leg.8th over: England 18-0 (Leach 13, Burns 3) As a long-time glasses wearer , I feel an immediate affinity with cricketers in specs. After Imam ul Haq in the World Cup, now Jack Leach. The urge to put his hand inside his helmet and readjust those specs must be so strong. Especially on a sweaty day. I’m in awe. Adair runs in with four slips. Leach grabs two with a drive and nearly gets yorked from the final ball of the over.David Hopkins has a bone to pick: “ I can’t help but think Brian Withington is being a bit unfair on the honourable member for the 18th century. It’s not that he considers Ireland to be beyond the pale - I understand he’s perfectly happy to sequester his funds there ahead of the impending Brexit crash he’s happy to impose on the rest of us for example.”7th over: England 15-0 (Leach 11, Burns 3) I’m guessing that the bowlers won’t have long spells today so Burns and Leach probably only have another 15 minutes max before Murtagh retires to pasture. Burns fiddles with his gloves as they flash up his stats - a Test average of 34, two fifties and a hundred. A first-class average of 42. He warily plays out a Murtagh maiden. Two in a row. Careful England. 6th over: England 15-0 (Leach 11, Burns 3) Adair runs in, and Leach prods, defends, avoids. A maiden.During Adair’s last over I noticed that third and fourth slip switched places for the last delivery. It was a very rushed, almost panicked movement, that struck me as odd. I’m struggling to recall seeing this happen before. Can you enlighten me?Phil, I’m afraid I didn’t notice, I must have been glancing at the screen. I can’t think of any particular reason. Maybe other OBO readers can help?5th over: England 15-0 (Leach 11, Burns 3) Overthrows in England’s favour , again, gets the score jogging along. Leach and Burns go through for a quick single, there is a shy at the stumps, it hits, but the ball riccochets off and runs down to the boundary. Other than that, we have line and length, line and length from Murtagh. 4th over: England 9-0 (Leach 6, Burns 2) Adair finds some swing in the humid Lord’s air. He’s too good for Leach, who shuffles left to right to try to combat the movement.Brian Withington writes: “Try as I might, I have been unable to unearth a tweet from Jacob Rees-Mogg linking yesterday’s cricket with Brexit developments. Perhaps he was otherwise engaged. Or maybe anything involving Ireland is just ‘beyond the pale’ for a politician who might have regarded the potato famine as a regrettable but unavoidable local difficulty?”Brian, I’m afraid that JRM was probably too busy after being promoted to Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons in Boris Johnson’s new government. There are no words. 3rd over: England 6-0 (Leach 4, Burns 2) It’s the main man. Tim Murtagh rubs his chest and sighs the sigh of a man in the golden autumn of his career. Leach is watchful, glasses visible through the grill. He is beaten by a 71mph-er and then squeezes a four between third slip and gully in an utterly unconvincing way. 2nd over: England 2-0 (Leach 0, Burns 2)  Rory Burns plays no stroke at the first ball of the day from Mark Adair, then goes down the pitch to prod a patch of unruly carpet. Adair’s face is blazed with suncream and the thermometer reads 32 degrees. I’m actually grateful to be in the shade of the house. Burns is off the mark with a nudge off the hip. And the players are on their way out. It’s boiling hot and the pitch looks much drier than yesterday. Can England still be there by sandwiches?Ah Nasser - still my favourite ever England captain. He’s out on the pitch demonstrating in a crisp shirt where England’s batsmen went wrong yesterday.“Technically England were very very poor against the moving ball. Many modern-day cricketers go too hard against the moving ball. Why would anyone listen to Nasser Hussain? An old has-been? I say listen to Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson who have learnt how to deal with it.”Wondering if the magic will be with Tim Murtagh today? Tom vdGucht was, though he admits to being somewhat bewitched by Olly Stone. Although it seems quite perverse to think about any other bowler other than Dial M for Murtagh, what did you make of Olly Stone on his debut?The only slight reservation I have with him, following seeing him in the flesh first the first time yesterday, is how much he resembles Jay from the Inbetweeners. I’m pretty sure fearsome fast bowlers shouldn’t be able to get work as part-time lookalikes of comedy characters, unless that character happens to be Viv from The Young Ones...I thought Stone did all that could have been asked of him yesterday - occasionally hitting 90mph with a box of tricks up his sleeve. I’m ashamed to admit, though, that I’ve never watched the Inbetweeners, but I feel like lots of fast bowlers are cartoon versions of someone: Merv Hughes, Shoaib Akhtar, even Bob Willis must resemble some dystopian figure from somewhere.Vic Lanser writes with news from THE OTHER PLACE. But as it is so good, I think we can quietly reprint it.Tanya, I loved this comment on Cricinfo:Chris Crighton: “So England won the toss, elected to bat, and eight hours later their openers were 0-0 at the close. All of Geoffrey Boycott’s dreams have finally come true.”David Gower is wearing a panama! David Lloyd was not impressed by England yesterday. “England played in front of their bodies to a bowler who is deadly accurate and bowling at 78mph. The top three is still a huge problem.”And thanks to James Hurle - here is the TMS link for overseas listeners. I’m trying to work out if ICC have any specific guidelines on heat in Test matches -meanwhile, some reading on the heat effects of cricket helmets and a study on the effects of extreme heat on Elite Australian players. With the mercury due to touch 39 degrees today at Lord’s - playing and watching is likely to be an extremely uncomfortable experience. The MCC have made contingency measures for spectators - air-conditioned rooms, plenty of water, no jackets for members. But for players, things are more unclear .Joe Root was hospitalized during the last Ashes Test at Sydney, when the temperature reached 47.3C. Cricket Australia has strict guidelines on heat, and uses the Wet Bulb Global Temperature Index. The ECB do not, yet, as far as I can discover, but last year the MCC cricket committee agreed that umpires should be able to stop play because of heat.This is the law umpires could use:It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or exceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous o runreasonable for play to take place.Conditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal.The fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as unreasonable or dangerous.Good morning everyone and welcome to the morning after the day before after the week before. Twenty wickets fell in yesterday’s ding-dong day - with England out before lunch and batting again just before the close.What craziness! Were England caught napping? Were their heads in a fifty-over space? Were they just caught out by the relentless accuracy of Tim Murtagh on an emerald green carpet? We shall see as the morning develops. Here is Vic’s match report for starters:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49bdd1e6f940addf2c5a2b1fa928a2081194c46f/0_157_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abeb97cd42f91f4ba1dfc1cd22ca04c5","title":"tour de france 2019 stage 18 live","story":"“Just catching up on the first part of the stage,” says Nick Venables, “and Quintana is in the break? Has his star fallen that far that the pelotón don’t even care that he’s up front? Arkea-Samsic’s manager must be wondering if his, I presume, huge contract is worth it.”He’s at the head of the group chasing the front two. He’ll fancy himself to do something today, I shouldn’t wonder. They’re now 1.25 ahead and into the climb. They look pretty chilled in the circumstances and when did “chilled” become “chill”?We’re at the bottom of the Col d’Izoard Bernard and Van Avermaet lead by about 25s. “I read somewhere that Henri Desgrange, who organized the very first Tour de France in 1903, envisioned a race so hard that only one rider would actually make it to Paris,” emails Scott Urista. “We may see something like that over the next three days...”If I may quote myself, I once wrote about that Tour, as follows:“If there’s one thing we know about our species, it’s that we will cheat at anything: ever since Adam ate from the tree of knowledge and feigned ignorance to an omniscient God, every field of human endeavour is punctuated by our dazzling capacity for mendacity. In art there is forgery, in marriage there is adultery, in computers there is hacking, in finance there is insider dealing, and in politics, well how long have you got?So of course we cheat at sport of course we have always cheated at sport. Consider the first Tour de France, for example, during which nine riders were disqualified - some of them for taking cars and trains. Of the 27 finishers, 15 more were pulled including the top four places and every stage winner. That was in 1904, and very little has changed.”As it goes, the lads are looking ok, but could probably do with things being done. “Parklife has a bit of a place in my heart thanks to it coming out in the mid-90s, when the white heat of Britpop and my mid-teens combined in something suitably hormonally influential,” says Neil Withers, “BUT hearing or even imagining Damon Albarn singing ‘...eating all the morsels’ from Tracy Jacks sets my teeth on edge like nothing else on earth.Some cycling, just to keep us both honest: as much as I’m sure we all like Geraint Thomas, surely we’re all holding out for either Alaphilippe or Pinot to win this year? They’ve both been awesome, Pinot v unlucky with that echelon split – plus France would go toutes bananes, non?”That’s actually End of a Century, which is one of the better ones I’d say. It’d be right up there if either of them pulled it off whoever does will deserve it. Hi again, Vitamin D duly imbibed and here we go. There’s just under 95km to go, and the gap between the leaders and the rest has stayed roughly the same. Arndt’s ill-fated push for a solo break has come to nothing, but Greg Van Avermaet is now having a go as the Col d’Izoard draws ever closer. And with that, I’ll hand you back to Daniel ...The leading group are back on flat ground after the descent, with Sunweb’s Nikias Arndt eking out a 20-second lead. There’s a 7m 30sec gap between the leading pack and the peloton. Here’s a bit of lunchtime viewing:Eesh, a nasty crash towards the back of the peloton, with Nicholas Roche and Jumbo-Visma’s George Bennett – a key lieutenant for Steven Kruijswijk – coming off particularly badly.Thanks Daniel. The leading group have crested the Col de Vars, with Wellens taking the 10 King of the Mountains points ahead of Romain Bardet. Lutsenko was third, Quintana fourth. The peloton are about to reach the peak, with a long and winding descent to come.Right, I’m off for a spot of lunch Niall McVeigh takes over as your domestique for the next bit. “Modern Life is Rubbish was a far superior beast to Parklife,” reckons Matthew Lysaght, “which isn’t difficult in fairness. Only saw them once, in 2003 in The Olympia in Dublin, when Coxon had been replaced by Simon Tong. Pinot to do the business today on Alaphillipe. Quintana for the stage.” I saw them twice: once at the first V, and once when they reformed. I suppose they may have been better at various other times, but Damon isn’t a good frontman and the tunes don’t translate – aren’t elevated – outside of the studio and lounge environment. The group catch Cherel, who wasn’t into it at all. “What do you think of yesterday’s expulsions?” asks Thomas Atkins. “Wouldn’t blame you if you chose to ignore the whole affair in order to avoid the usual tedious pro and anti-Ineos traffic, but it strikes me that if I’d been involved in a crash because two people had been involved in a willy-waving contest at the front of the bunch, I’d be furious. IMO Martin and Rowe were lucky they didn’t cause a serious injury to someone, and chucking them off the race seemed fair.On a side note, Martin and Rowe sounds like a mid-noughties nu-folk duo who were on the cusp of commercial success before Mummford and Sons came along and ruined the genre for everyone.”I’m almost always pro ruckus in sport, and would endeavour to judge according to what did happen rather than according to what might’ve happened. Expulsion seems a bit much to me, though i understand why that was what happened. The gradient is starting to warm up and Cherel is up front, looking to increase the pace - perhaps for Bardet. 129km to go, 6.30 the gap to the peloton. “Crossed to the dark side this morning,” says Andrew Mullinder, “and Armstrong and Hincape had an interesting take on the Rowe-Martin contretemps. They contended that it happened because there’s no clear lead team this year, with Ineos not taking its usual Sky-boss role. Because of that, when roads narrow or key sections approach, several teams think they have a right to the prime locations in the Peleton. Given a tough tour well into its third week, and 40 degree heat, tempers -- and entitlement -- flared as they all jostled for that slot.” Tempers are an integral part of all sport. It never spoke to me. End of a Century and This is a Low are good, but the rest of it? Sub-Madness mockney nonsense. Blur are also one of the very worst live bands I’ve seen. “Can you somehow get a message to the riders to make it a really exciting stage today?” emails Stefan Glosby. “I’m stuck in an office without air conditioning and no work to do. Your coverage is the only thing keeping me going!”One outta two ain’t bad! The break lead the peloton by 5.56. among them is Tim Wellens, King of the Mountains, while guess who leads? Lutsenko is properly on one “ITV’s celebration of yellow jerseys,” emails Neil Withers, “set me to thinking while cycling into workthe open door of a fan oven this morning and came out as the following (to a tune that should be obvious):Yates, Roche, FroomeYou can swap Greg LeMond for IndurainDelgado if Spanish Tour winners from the 80s90s is more your thing.”It minded me of this, from an album that has very much not stood the test of time (nor was it great at the time, but that’s another story).“I’ve been hoping it for some time now,” tweets D-Lo, but is today finally going to be a big day for the Colombian boys?”Bernal will fancy it for sure. Tangentially, the Colombian flag is lowkey banger. Pinot’s Groupama lads tell Wiggins that they plan to attack on some mountains, but need to retain some energy for what’s coming up. I wonder if he’d go all-in if it looked liek the right thing to do.Apparently my email wasn’t quite working, so please send joy to: daniel.harris.casual@the.It seems that Perichon has been stung by a bee, and requires medical attention. Weird to think about the stuff he’s done without requiring that. It’s certainly hard to see Alaphilippe coming back if he loses his lead today. Pinot must surely fancy himself to perpetrate sadism and masochism this afternoon.In commentary, they reckon if Alaphilippe can stay in yellow today, he’ll be well-placed, and the presence of Dylan Van Baarle in the break tells us that Ineos plan to hiy him. At 142.5km, the leading group are 4.39 in front. Quintana and Bardet at the front and Adam Yates is close by. The commentary mention the great Eddie Merckx, so here’s this on him from Joy of Six: sporting beauty.So the breakaway are awayis away. Let me know which, grammar heroes. Of the leading group, now 41s clear, Quintana is the highest placed. There are 33 riders in the leading group, but though the start was a quick one, there’s been no definitive escape. The RoweMartin penalty seemed harsh,” tweets Guy Hornsby, “however sounds like TV didn’t have all the evidence. ITV had a push from Martin, but it appears Rowe gave him a bit of a slap. Still, it all seems a bit handbags, and a distraction from the start of three immense stages.”Yes, I can’t for the life of me fathom why anyone’s arsed enough not to just let it go. De Buyst and Arst take the big points, while Van Baarle leads the front group. Bardet is there, Quintana, and lots of other hopefuls. There’s a big split in the peloton and the frankly unwell Lutsenko is involved again as they sprint for the line... We’ve got an intermediate sprint coming up in 2km. About 20 riders have moved away, but not definitively so. Bardet is there towards the front – he fancies a stage win, you’d think.There’s been a crash of some sort - Caleb Ewan and and Wout Poels contrived to run each other over the edge of the round. Both are back on the road. Peter Chymera asks for a stage breakdown...Decent second career for yerman Impey. He’s pushing the pace now, perhaps setting it up for Adam Yates.Lutsenko, Yates, Impey and Kamna put in some work, and pull 16s away from the peloton. No way four’s enough to cement a break, but perhaps they’re trying to run the gas out of each other. 174.6m to go as Bradley “Brad” Wiggins tells us that “you have to pray” for the lads doing the work. “They haven’t even started the climb yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16fa263bce2b2fc6ceef0a606efb5b5ddcb940c1/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40f633d19199241b055ea4ee69cba470","title":"which is the best tablet for an artist","story":"Hugh wants to buy his wife a new tablet to replace her old Samsung Galaxy 10.1.

In this case, you draw on the tablet with a stylus and your pen-strokes appear on a separate screen. It’s a little like using a mouse.Graphics tablets and drawing tablets use the computing power of laptops or desktops, so they can handle the huge, detailed drawings required for architectural design and similar purposes. The tablet view may be just a window onto a much larger design.Today, almost all smartphones and tablets, and most hybrid or convertible laptops, have touch screens, so you can draw on them with your fingers. A smaller number support pens. The key point is that they are standalone devices. They don’t need to be attached to a computer.The leading examples fall into three main ranges: Samsung’s Galaxy Tab, Apple’s iPad Pro and Microsoft’s Surface Pro. There are alternatives, but these are the ones to beat.From a drawing point of view, the important points include screen size and resolution, the colour accuracy of the screen, pen pressure levels and latency. Basically, if you press harder, the pen should produce a stronger line. A pressure sensitivity of 2,048 is recommended. I can’t tell the difference between 256, 1024 and 2048, but as an artist, your wife probably can.Latency refers to the delay between the pen or stylus moving across the screen and a line appearing. Latency used to be terrible on tablets. It doesn’t seem to be a problem on the latest devices, though some apps are worse than others. The best way to check latency is to try a device. However, you can get a pretty good idea from watching people draw in YouTube videos.Standalone tablets, unlike graphics tablets, can perform many other functions. You can do your email, watch videos, play games and so on. Some people will choose one tablet rather than another because it runs particular software – such as Adobe Creative Suite – or particular apps. Some will be influenced by how well it works with their other devices and online services, such as Office 365. Many will be influenced by price, though you haven’t given me a budget.With hindsight, it would be a good idea to check how much it costs to replace the battery in the tablet you choose. All the main ranges have sealed-in batteries, which does not bode well for their longevity. Battery degradation is also a risk factor when buying second-hand devices.As I’ve said before, it’s generally not worth changing systems unless you need to. When you switch, you give up a lot of valuable experience, you lose the comfort of familiarity, and you may have to find and learn a lot of new programs andor apps. You shouldn’t switch unless the new system delivers one or more significant advantages – not minor ones that all its rivals will add in a year or so – and does not come with numerous disadvantages.Your wife seems to be a happy Samsung Galaxy user. If she doesn’t have any real problems with her current device, and isn’t keen to try something new, your replacement should be as much like that as possible, only better.The S4 improves on the 9.7in S3 by offering a bigger screen with higher resolution, slimmer bezels, a faster processor and twice as much storage. However, the S3 is still a viable option if you want something cheaper. Artist blogger Teoh Yi Chie compares the S3 and S4 in a YouTube video, and in a more detailed post at Parka Blogs.To the starting price, you would need to add an Apple Pencil 2 (£119), and possibly an SD card connector (£39) and a headphone jack converter (£9). You might also want the keyboard case (£199), AppleCare (£129) and some other dongles. It adds up, and for drawing, it’s silly money.Fortunately, there are cheaper options. The 10.5in iPad Air (2019) is very much like the old iPad Pro (2017) but has a much faster processor, and it’s cheaper. The main things you lose are the “ProMotion display” refresh rate of up to 120 Hz – the iPad Air is a perfectly acceptable 60Hz – a couple of small speakers and a slightly worse rear camera (8MP instead of 12MP).Usually, someone would choose based on a need for certain apps or a preference for one of the operating systems. I think the iPad has more and better tablet apps. However, both systems seem to be about equally good for drawing, and your wife already knows how to use Android.One interesting but decidedly odd device is Lenovo’s 10.1in Yoga Book convertible. This has two touch-screens: a colour screen for normal use, and a monochrome screen that doubles as a keyboard. You can also use the monochrome screen for writing and drawing. It has 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity, so it might be quite good. (I only tried the keyboard I didn’t like it.)The Yoga Book YB1-X90L shows its heritage in its Intel Atom x5-Z8550 processor, 4GB of memory, 64GB of storage and 1920 x 1200 screen resolution.It’s not the best choice for your wife’s purposes. However, others could find uses for a 690g dual-screen Android laptop where one screen works as a colour tablet and the other lets you draw and make handwritten notes.Have you got a question?

This is a man who has broken the law and he should be impeached.”“He is not exonerated,” the senator Bernie Sanders said, calling Trump a “racist” who is “trying to ide the American people up based on the color of their skin.”The Vermont senator, who has called on the House to begin an impeachment inquiry, said it is a matter of fact “that the president did everything that he could to obstruct the Mueller investigation.”As the candidates spoke in Detroit, Mueller testified before to House panels on Capitol Hill about his 448-report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. In his testimony, Mueller dismissed Trump’s claims of total exoneration, stating explicitly that his conclusions did not clear the president of obstruction of justice.The hours of nationally-televised testimony produced few revelations beyond what was included in Mueller’s report, which was delivered to the justice department in March. The special counsel’s investigation “did not establish” that Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election but it declined to make a determination as to whether Trump obstructed justice.Impeachment proceedings must begin in the House, where the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has resisted growing support for impeachment among her Democratic caucus, saying repeatedly that it would play into Trump’s hands politically ahead of the 2020 election. Last week, the House stopped an effort to launch impeachment proceedings, but 95 Democrats voted in support of moving forward with the resolution.“I think there are impeachable offenses and that the president should be tried for them,” former vice-president and current 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden told reporters at a campaign stop in Dearborn, Michigan. “I think it’s something that the House has to come about in an orderly way so that the American people understand that this is not done for political reasons.”Asked if a Biden administration would pursue charges against Trump after he leaves office, as candidates such as the California senator Kamala Harris have suggested, Biden said it was “premature” and that he did not advocate for “lock him up or send her home or that kind of stuff”.Harris, who supports impeachment, accused the attorney general, William Barr, of “misleading the American people” about Mueller’s findings and said Mueller’s public testimony would help set the record straight.“The American people are smart enough to know what is and what is not truth,” she said.The senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is also a 2020 presidential candidate, agreed the House should begin impeachment proceedings, saying Mueller’s report described behavior of “deceit” and “instructing people to lie”.Yet he urged Democrats to focus their energy on removing Trump from office “at the ballot box” as an inquiry would almost certainly result in an acquittal by the Republican-led Senate.South Bend mayor and 2020 candidate Pete Buttigieg told reporters at the conference in Detroit that an impeachment inquiry would “bring more facts to light” but he too cautioned that the proceedings would probably stall in the Senate.“I’m focusing on the best thing I can do about the Trump presidency, which is to defeat it in November of 2020,” he said.The former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, who was not asked about impeachment during his remarks at the conference, said in a statement that Mueller’s testimony adds “urgency” to calls for impeachment.“There must be consequences, accountability and justice,” O’Rourke said. “And the only way to ensure this is for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings.”On Tuesday, the Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, one of the four freshman lawmakers of color Trump said should “go back to the countries they came from”, received a standing ovation as she took the stage to address the NAACP conference gathered in the city where she was born – and now represents in Congress.“Y’all, I’m not going nowhere,” Tlaib began her remarks. “Not until I impeach this president.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6465b761e7f9e816a2897c26c8ac7ae8359054a5/922_281_4078_2447/master/4078.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=889aba51fefc9a99ec953aba229413b7","title":"china business xi jinping communist party state private enterprise huawei","story":"Much of modern China’s epic growth was driven by private enterprise – but under Xi Jinping, the Communist party has returned to being the ultimate authority in business as well as politics. By  Richard McGregorFrom the Mao era onwards, Chinese state firms have always had a predominant role in the economy, and the Communist party has always maintained direct control over state firms. For more than a decade, the party has also tried to ensure it played a role inside private businesses. But in his first term in office, Xi has overseen a sea change in how the party approaches the economy, dramatically strengthening the party’s role in both government and private businesses.Such shifts, under Xi, have gifted the US and EU an excuse to limit Chinese access to their markets, technology and companies. Australia has cited the same intelligence law to keep Huawei’s 5G technology out of its future mobile networks. Gordon Sondland, Donald Trump’s envoy to the European Union, gave such sentiment a hyperbolic spin to argue that Europe should do the same. “We want to keep critical infrastructure in the western world out of Chinese malign influence,” Sondland said. “Someone from the politburo in Beijing picks up the phone and says, ‘I wanna listen in on the following conversation, I wanna run a certain car off the road that’s on the 5G network and kill the person that’s in it’ – there’s nothing that company legally can do today in China to prevent the Chinese government from making that request successfully.”Until recently, such a statement would have been laughed out of court. No longer. Nor would Washington have contemplated the policy of “decoupling” the US and Chinese economies – shorthand for the administration’s commitment, through taxes, tariffs and other punitive measures, to disentangle its companies and their technologies from China’s supply chains.The relationship between the party and private sector companies is, up to a point, flexible – certainly more so than with state companies. The party doesn’t habitually micromanage their day-to-day operations. The firms are largely still in charge of their basic business decisions. But pressure from party committees to have a seat at the table when executives are making big calls on investment and the like means the “lines have been dangerously blurred”, in the words of one analyst. “Chinese domestic laws and administrative guidelines, as well as unspoken regulations and internal party committees, make it quite difficult to distinguish between what is private and what is state-owned.”The answer to the question “does the party control a company?” is that it is impossible to tell. In the current environment, fewer foreign governments want to give Beijing the benefit of the doubt. If there was any question as to who was in charge of the economy and business, Xi’s local and overseas critics alike only have to take the Chinese leader at his word, that in private enterprises, as with state-owned firms and every institution in China, the party is the ultimate authority.In the early optimistic glow of Xi’s ascension to the leadership, a number of western commentators talked up his appreciation of markets. After all, from 1985 to 2007, Xi had served in two provinces, Fujian and Zhejiang, which were thriving bastions of private enterprise. Starting in the 1980s, Fujian was an important gateway for investors from nearby Taiwan, while Zhejiang was home to a number of China’s most famous private companies, such as Jack Ma’s Alibaba. The arc of Xi’s father’s career, from revolutionary to reformer, reinforced this optimism about China’s new leader. Lu Guanqiu, a businessman who owned and ran Wanxiang, a private car parts group, told Bloomberg: “When Xi becomes general secretary, he’ll be even more open and will pay even more attention to private enterprise and the people’s livelihood. It is because he was in Zhejiang for five years.”Yet a deeper dig into Xi’s past statements and writings on the economy reveals an official who has been a dogged supporter of party orthodoxy on the economy at every turn. Xi might have taken big risks in domestic and foreign policy, but on the economy he was not one for ideological experimentation. In the politburo, as vice-president from 2008 to 2013 and as the leader of the party school for most of the same period, there is little evidence of him straying from his core beliefs about the need to strengthen party control inside businesses.When Xi arrived in Zhejiang in 2002, the province was already well on the way up the economic ladder. Xi headed a group of officials, known as the “New Zhejiang Army”, who embraced the use of private investment to spread the risk in funding the province’s signature infrastructure projects. In 2007, in a conversation with Washington’s then ambassador to Beijing, Clark Randt Jr, recorded in US diplomatic cables and later released by WikiLeaks, Xi delivered a sophisticated, self-aware exposition on Zhejiang. He didn’t pretend that there was any secret to the province’s wealth other than local entrepreneurs, although he avoided using the language of the market in describing them. Xi did what every other official with responsibility for the economy did at the time: he simplified registration for private companies and helped them to access finance. When the party debated a law to protect private property, he supported it. “With property protection in place, Chinese can gain even more wealth,” Xi told Randt.But Xi’s support for mixing private and public ownership structures was purely pragmatic. It had value, he said in another forum, because it would “improve the socialist market economic structure”. Xi’s assessment is echoed by Michael Collins, one of the CIA’s most senior officials for Asia. “The fundamental end of the Communist party of China under Xi Jinping is all the more to control that society politically and economically,” Collins argued earlier this year. “The economy is being viewed, affected and controlled to achieve a political end.”By 2012, when Xi came to power, the landscape had changed substantially. China was initially knocked sideways by the global financial crisis in 2008, before swiftly navigating its way back to fast growth through a giant fiscal stimulus orchestrated by the government and delivered by the big state banks. The economy was also changing shape. From around 2010, after the fiscal splurge of the financial crisis, Chinese technocrats began to focus more intently on cutting debt and lifting consumption. That meant less focus on investment and exports and, if you listened to the entrepreneurs, a greater reliance on private business to generate growth.“Chinese consumption is not driven by the government but by entrepreneurship, and the market,” Jack Ma of Alibaba said in September 2015. “In the past 20 years, the government was so strong. Now, they are getting weak. It’s our opportunity it’s our show time, to see how the market economy, entrepreneurship, can develop real consumption.”Ma may have thought that the times suited him, and to a degree, they did. His business continued to soar. But Xi was all the time making sure that the party grew in tandem with the economy, in both the state and private sectors. In retrospect, Ma’s comments look dangerously cocky.Xi spent much of his first term in power reining in the big state firms. Under his predecessor, Hu Jintao, many of the large state enterprises, big enough to be in the top 20 of the global Fortune 500, had grown into powerful empires and breeding grounds for serious corruption. In the words of analyst Wendy Leutert, Xi “faced the aftermath of a decade of rapid expansion and weak internal discipline in the state sector”.In 2016, Xi chaired a national meeting that cleared the way for a more expansive role for the party in enterprise. In 2017, the measures were further extended, with the body overseeing big state companies directing them to write the party into their articles of association. In 2018, the securities regulator followed up by issuing a new corporate governance code requiring listed firms, at home and abroad, to include in their internal guidelines an expansive role for the party. Many Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong also wrote the party’s role into their articles of association.In some ways, codifying in public documents the party’s role in managing companies was both an instance of rare transparency and part of an increasing trend of the party openly displaying its power. In the past, Chinese state-owned listed companies had customarily filed misleading prospectuses ahead of their stock exchange listings, omitting the party’s pivotal role in the hiring and firing of senior executives. Similarly, company boards had long been legally and theoretically independent of the party, but not in practice. “The same inidual who is chairing a party committee meeting on a Monday might well be chairing a board meeting later in the week,” notes a 2018 report on Chinese corporate governance.There has always been an awkward fit between western notions of corporate governance and the party state’s insistence on having a role in companies. “It is rather like drawing a tiger with a cat as a model,” said one Chinese commentator. But the direction of policy under Xi has been clear: the power that the party had over business decisions and personnel in state firms, once wielded behind the scenes, would not only be strengthened. The party’s power would also be exercised explicitly.Xi’s shadow now looms increasingly large over private firms as well. In March 2012, a few months before taking over as general secretary, Xi delivered a speech in which he stressed the need to increase the number of party bodies inside private business. Around the same time, new details for “party building” in enterprises were released, calling “for the party secretary to participate in and attend important executive-level meetings”.Although the party is becoming more involved in private firms than ever, it wants to be part of business successes, not failures. It wants to sit alongside local and foreign entrepreneurs and share their wealth, not run their companies into the ground. Increasingly, it also wants to do more than supervise companies. It wants to be at the table when commercial decisions are made, not just manage staff. “We should make money together,” Lu Wei, then head of China’s party office for internet security, told Paul Jacobs, CEO of Qualcomm, a US chip maker, in 2014. Lu’s comments to some extent reflected Beijing’s desire to acquire Qualcomm’s technology, a sector in which China was weak. But the message was clear: the fat of the land should be shared with the state.The party’s overarching aim, though, has remained consistent: to ensure that the private sector, and inidual entrepreneurs, do not become rival players in the political system. The party wants economic growth, but not at the expense of tolerating any organised alternative centres of power. During the 1990s, Chinese leaders watched in horror as the Soviet Union disintegrated and its assets were privatised. Having seen business threaten to take over the state in Russia, Beijing has been determined to make sure that the same disaster does not befall China.For a reliable benchmark about the power of the party in China, you only need to listen to wealthy entrepreneurs hold forth on politics. These otherwise all-powerful CEOs go to abject lengths to praise the party. To take a few companies listed in a single article in the South China Morning Post, Richard Liu of e-commerce group JD predicted communism would be realised in his generation and all commercial entities would be nationalised. Xu Jiayin of Evergrande Group, one of China’s largest property developers, said that everything the company possessed was given by the party and he was proud to be the party secretary of his company. Liang Wengen of Sany Heavy Industry, which builds earthmovers, went even further, saying his life belonged to the party. “They act as if they are being chased by a bear,” wrote Zhang Lin, a Beijing political commentator, in response to these comments. “They are powerless to control the bear, so they are competing to outrun each other to escape the animal.”Jack Ma of Alibaba, the global face of Chinese entrepreneurship, has always managed to strike a quirkier and more independent stance than his fellow billionaires. “Be in love with the government. But don’t marry them,” he memorably said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2015. Ma’s pithy aphorisms at home and abroad were mostly a plus for his business, but they had a downside. Ma’s high profile made him vulnerable. Last year, one of Ma’s former business partners told me, only half-joking, that if there was a presidential election in China tomorrow, Ma might win. That, he added, was a dangerous position to be in.In September 2018, Ma unexpectedly announced that he would step down from a day-to-day role in the company the following year. Ma said he wanted to focus on education and philanthropy. An equally plausible reason for his resignation, the former business partner said, was Ma’s fear that his power and popularity had made him a target of the party. Ma has been in the party since the 1980s, although his membership was not declared until late 2018, after his retirement announcement, in an article in which the People’s Daily newspaper complimented him for his contributions to reform.Whether or not some entrepreneurs were intent on taking him on, Xi pre-emptively took the fight to them. In 2017, his administration began a campaign to rein in swashbuckling business leaders, starting with some of the corporate chieftains who had become the standard-bearers for aggressive Chinese dealmaking overseas. Some business leaders were forced out of overheated commercial sectors such as real estate. Others were told to pull back from offshore forays, either because their high profile was an embarrassment for Beijing or because the government was trying to stop capital flight. Some, such as Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of Anbang Insurance Group, went the way that communist members who fall foul of the system often do, vanishing without explanation into the party’s detention system. Only months earlier, Wu had been leading negotiations to spend $14bn on hotels in the US, but the deal collapsed. In May 2018, the authorities announced Wu had been sentenced to 18 years in jail for fraud and embezzlement.Meanwhile, China’s three dominant internet companies, Baidu (a search engine), Alibaba (e-commerce) and Tencent (messaging and gaming), known collectively as the BAT, have all felt the government’s wrath. In 2018, Tencent lost $200bn in its market capitalisation after regulators stopped approving new online games, pushing the company out of the world’s top 10 companies ranked by their share market valuation. The rapid growth of the BAT companies and their dominance of the internet in China has given them an outsized economic status. But their political value is just as important, as they have become indispensable to China’s surveillance state. With the mountain of data they generate, the BAT trinity are in effect turning into a real-time, efficient and privately run intelligence platform. In that respect, they are seen as ideal private companies. They both drive economic growth and also buttress the political system.Foreign CEOs, too, have come under pressure to give the party a larger role in their firms. Again, this is a trend that began before Xi. Walmart, which famously won’t allow unions in its US stores, has had party cells in its companies in China since at least 2006, and party-controlled unions even earlier. Under Xi, however, emboldened officials have pushed foreign firms harder to accommodate the party and give its representatives a role in business decisions.Now a wide range of foreign companies in China, from the cosmetics giant L’Oréal to Walt Disney and Dow Chemicals, all have party committees and display the hammer and sickle on their premises. In 2017, Reuters published an article that quoted executives from one European company saying that party representatives had demanded to be brought into the executive committee and have the business pay their expenses. Like Chinese entrepreneurs, foreign businessmen and women are trying to outrun “the bear”, not always with success.But the party’s persistent efforts to colonise the private sector have stoked a backlash of their own. In late 2017, the EU business chamber in China formally complained about party organisations trying to extend their influence in their member companies, something they said would undermine the authority of their boards.Yet the chamber’s argument was met with indifference in China, at least in public utterances. “When you are in Rome, do as the Romans do,” said Chen Fengying, an expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a foreign policy thinktank. “Foreign investors should respect local rules and regulations in China.”On one level, Xi has been untroubled by the backlash over his treatment of entrepreneurs. From his point of view, the idea that the private sector is being overly politicised is upside-down. Business leaders should “strengthen self-study, self-education and self-improvement,” he said in 2016. “They should not feel uncomfortable with this requirement. The Communist party has similar and stricter requirements on its leaders.”Later, in 2018, when the economy started to slow and the trade war was ramping up, Xi was much more pragmatic and solicitous. In November, he invited a select group of entrepreneurs, including Tencent’s Ma Huateng (also known as Pony Ma), for a meeting in the Great Hall of the People. He wanted to reassure them that they were “all part of our family”. At the same time, a surfeit of stories appeared in the official media urging banks to lend private firms more money.But not all entrepreneurs were buying the new line. One businessman, Chen Tianyong, posted a lengthy rant on social media, which he titled “An Entrepreneur’s Farewell Admonition”, explaining why he had left China. “China’s economy is like a giant ship heading to the precipice,” he wrote in a post that was later taken down. “Without fundamental changes, it’s inevitable that the ship will be wrecked and the passengers will die.”Adapted from Xi Jinping: The Backlash by Richard McGregor, published by Penguin Books and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d6deddffa267cc6aaf5c781aae0db92dc1043ab/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=103e858977510e05c678d9642384a6a7","title":"israel ex pm ehud barak makes pact with leftwing party","story":"Barak forms pact with Meretz – with goal of ousting Benjamin Netanyahu in SeptemberIsrael’s former centre-left prime minister Ehud Barak has made an election pact with leftwing politicians in an attempt to unseat the incumbent PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, in upcoming elections.The 77-year-old retired from politics in 2013 but returned in dramatic fashion this summer to help end what he said was Netanyahu’s “rule with the radicals, racists and the corrupt”.Barak once commanded Netanyahu in the army but later served as his defence minister. He has been a vocal critic of the prime minister, who faces three major corruption scandals and has been slammed for allying with far-right political figures.On Thursday, Barak, another prominent Israeli politician, Stav Shaffir, and the small anti-occupation Meretz party signed an agreement to run together in the 17 September poll under a single party called the “Democratic Camp”.Mergers are common in Israeli politics, giving smaller parties that might not cross an electoral threshold a better chance of entering parliament as an alliance. Barak does not appear to be a candidate to replace Netanyahu himself. Nitzan Horowitz, the leader of Meretz, will lead the Democratic Camp.Another Meretz lawmaker and former party leader, Tamar Zandberg, called the merger a “dramatic move to strengthen the left” and a “significant boost to justice and equality as an alternative to the corrupt and messianic right”.It is unclear if centre and leftwing parties will form a large enough bloc to unseat the right’s grip on power. Barak, whose premiership ended after the outbreak of a Palestinian uprising in 2000, is a wildcard in 2019 but may not tip the balance.Israel is holding elections just months after an April poll in which rightwing parties came out with a clear lead. Regardless, Netanyahu was unable to form a majority coalition government due to infighting between religious and secular parties.Rather than give his rivals a chance to forge a government, the prime minister’s Likud party instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, triggering repeat elections.On Tuesday, Barak apologised for the killing of 13 Arab protesters by Israeli police at the start of the second intifada under his watch.It was widely seen as a move to woo leftwingers, such as Meretz supporters, and Palestinian citizens of Israel – who make up roughly a fifth of the country’s population.While army credentials give Barak gravitas among security-minded voters, the opposition is already filled with former military figures leading to fears his entry to the race could split the anti-Netanyahu vote. The centrist Blue and White party, which drew even with Likud in the 9 April election, is led by former army chief of staff Benny Gantz and two ex-generals.As of Saturday, Netanyahu became Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, spending more than 13 years in office. He is due to face pre-trial hearings for corruption allegations weeks after the vote.

It calls for a limit of one cruise ship with a maximum of 4,000 passengers disembarking on any given day.At present, there are often five and even as many as eight moored in the port, with some 15,000 passengers on board.The manifesto – drawn up by a group of more than 30 NGOs, residents’ associations and community groups – asserts that “mega cruise ship tourism has increased in a way that is unsustainable and undesirable for our city, leading to serious environmental impact and increasing social protest”.In a recent report compiled by Transport \u0026amp Environment, a European NGO, Palma was second only to Barcelona as the European report most polluted by cruise ships.The manifesto goes on to say that a cruise ship moored in the port produces 200 times more airborne pollution than a motorway. The ships also discharge “grey water” – from swimming pools and laundries – a mere four miles off the coast. Oil slicks from sunblock in swimming pools have also been shown to be harmful to marine life.Marta Ferriol, coordinator of the NGO Tramuntana XXI, one of the organisations backing the manifesto, says “as an island we have limited resources and these ships are like floating cities that discharge their waste in our waters”.“The problem is cruise ship tourists arrive all at once and they saturate the historic part of the city,” says Ferriol. “They don’t spend money in the city. We’ve recently seen a report from Naples that says this type of tourism doesn’t bring any benefits to residents.”Jaume Garau of Palma XXI, another signatory of the manifesto, believes that what lies behind the move is the election of a more progressive government in Mallorca and a growing awareness of the need to combat climate change.“There is now a common project to manage tourism better in the environmental context and we have political parties who are showing an interest in bringing about this change,” he says.Neus Truyol, the Palma councillor for sustainability and urban issues, commented that “just as we have taken measures to limit tourist apartments and hotels, now it’s the turn of the cruise ships”.However, she added that any restrictions agreed are unlikely to come into force before 2022 as contracts have already been signed by the port of Palma and the cruise companies. She added that it would still be possible to introduce measures to limit the impact on Palma’s historic centre.Not everyone is opposed to the ships. A group of 10 organisations representing tourism bodies, taxi drivers and restaurants say the cruise ships shouldn’t be “demonised”.They point to a recent port authority report that claims cruises bring €256m to the island and support some 5,000 jobs.Nearly half of Mallorca’s 900,000 residents live in Palma. The island received around 10 million tourists in 2018.Controversy over cruise ships is not limited to Palma. In Venice last month a huge ship crashed into a wharf and a tourist boat, leading to renewed calls to ban or limit their presence in the city."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Veteran entertainer appears in court over alleged incident in Dublin bar last yearReport into whistleblower claims to be presented in cabinet meeting this afternoonA complaint about a creche can be investigated through TuslaCentral to the questioning will be why creches in question were able to remain openKatherine Zappone \u0026lsquodeeply upset\u0026rsquo by undercover creche investigationShip knocks Franky Zapata\u0026rsquos hoverboard into the water during a refueling stopUK all-time record temperature could be broken on ThursdayAppeal concerns decision to dismiss citizenship appeal due to \u0026lsquocontinuous residence\u0026rsquo clauseSome universities fearful that sweeping changes will undermine their autonomyMinisters to discuss drug cautions, night culture scheme and childcare at final meetingGarda, banks and students\u0026rsquo union issue advice to avoid falling victim to fraud\u0026lsquoI don\u0026rsquot think he\u0026rsquos any time for Northern Ireland at all,\u0026rsquo says football fanWheelchair users upset and exhausted by constant breakdown of lifts at train stationsLabour Court rules worker may sue Kuwaiti Cultural Office under Unfair Dismissals ActTemperature control to become a priority for nursing homes and hospitalsIreland remains \u0026lsquocompletely off course\u0026rsquo to achieve key carbon reduction targets by 2020 and 2030Research Lives: Prof Emma Teeling, UCD school of biology and environmental scienceThere are numerous beneficial outcomes to living near greenery, especially if there are treesInspector finds \u0026lsquocontinuing breaches of human rights\u0026rsquo including lack of privacy"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3967154.1564052370!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fuel mishap scuppers frenchman s bid to cross channel on hoverboard","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench inventor Franky Zapata takes off on his Flyboard to cross the Channel. Photograph: Reuters A French inventor failed in his attempt to cross the English Channel on a jet-powered hoverboard on Thursday when he was knocked into the water as he landed on a boat-mounted refuelling platform, his technical team said.Franky Zapata lifted off near the northern port of Calais with 42 litres of kerosene in his backpack, enough for about 10 minutes of flight.He planned to strap on a new backpack on a vessel waiting midway across the 35-km wide Strait of Dover.“It is a huge disappointment. He made his rendezvous with the refuelling boat, but the landing platform hit the flyboard, which threw him off balance and knocked him into the water,” support crew member Stephane Denis told BFM television.Zapata was making his attempt on the 110th anniversary of the first powered flight between Britain and France.But Denis said that with the landing platform two meters above the deck, every movement of the ship on the waves was exaggerated, making landing difficult.“He had practiced this manoeuvre in heavier seas without problems, but now, at the most important moment, it failed. Today was the 110th anniversary of Bleriot’s flight. It would have been a poignant moment,” Denis said.He added that Zapata was unharmed and would make a new attempt as soon as possible.Zapata had received a €1.3 million grant from the French army in late 2018 to help finance the development of the hoverboard, which is powered by five small jet engines.Zapata took off from Sangatte, France, at 7.06am. Flying at up to 140kmh at an altitude of between 15 to 20 metres he had hoped to reach to Dover in about 20 minutes.He disappeared from spectators’ view within moments, trailed by a helicopter, but minutes later his team announced the attempt had failed.Zapata had wowed crowds during France’s July 14th Bastille Day celebrations, flying over a military parade on Paris’ Place de la Concorde in the presence of French president Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.On July 25th, 1909, Frenchman Louis Bleriot became the first man to fly across the Channel in an airplane. Since then, Channel crossings have become a rite of passage for all kinds of new aircraft.Zapata, a champion on jetski-powered waterboards, steers his craft by leaning forward or backward and controls thrust with a throttle connected to his 1,500 horsepower board."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3967195.1564054952!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hyde seek controversy tusla set to appear before committee","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn investigation was carried out by RTÉ  into Hyde \u0026 Seek, a company that runs four creches in Dublin.

In one instance a child was placed alone in a room with the door closed for misbehaving.Tusla said today it will take full action, up to criminal prosecutions and to remove Hyde \u0026amp Seek creches from the register so they can no longer operate.Tusla’s director of quality assurance at the agency Brian Lee said the investigation had left him “sick to the stomach” about what he had seen.Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Katherine Zappone has said she was deeply shocked and appalled at the manner in which children were treated in a chain of Dublin creches."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3966449.1563997790!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parents advised to spend time in creches observing practices","story":"Parents need to know what to look for when selecting a creche for their child and should be aware of their rights if they are unhappy with something, according to the founder of a chain of 12 Dublin creches.“Parents need to know what good quality education looks like for early years,” Ms Clince said.For example many parents might think several bouncers and high chairs in a creche is normal, she said. However many creches now no longer use bouncers due to safety concerns and only use high chairs for very young infants.Parents might just accept that creches offer group and not inidualised care and that they can’t do anything about it. “But actually, that’s not true,” she said. Creches should be able to provide inidual care and attention to a child even in a group setting.Ms Clince encourages parents to spend time in the creche observing how it works. Most good creches will allow this, she said. They should observe the ethos, how staff speak to the children and if there is a lot of crying.“Ask questions about the sleep practices. Do they soothe the children? Do they stay in the room with them?“And ask about nappy changes. Are the children changed all together like on a conveyor belt or are they given inidual attention?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3967052.1564049067!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"weather watch humid in ireland heatwave in europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople enjoy the sun and the sea on a beach in Antibes,  France. Photograph:  EPASEBASTIEN NOGIERThe humid pleasant conditions of recent days are set to continue into the weekend, but temperatures will be nothing like the record-breaking highs elsewhere in Europe.Temperatures will reach a high of 25 degrees on Thursday in eastern areas when the sun breaks out. It will be overcast but warm across the country.Friday will be a similar day – although less warm than of late with highs of 22.It will stay mostly dry and sunny for the weekend across the country and any showers will be isolated. The recent dry spell will end on Monday with rain in the south and southeast, and Tuesday is forecast to be a blustery and showery day.Thursday could be a record-breaking day across much of Europe as a band of scorching hot air from the Sahara crosses the continent. It has been labelled the Omega block because it resembles that Greek letter.There is a strong possibility the UK’s highest temperature on record will be broken on Thursday. The current high of 38.5 was set in Faversham, Kent, during a heat wave in August 2003.The UK Met Office estimates a 70 per cent possibility this will be surpassed on Thursday with London likely to beat its own high of 38.4 degrees.Paris is likely to also smash records with an expected high of 42C, well above the previous record set in 1947.“It will get into the 30s across the country and reach the mid-30s in the southeast,” Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said. “If it is to get to 39 degrees, it will happen somewhere between London and Cambridge. Temperatures locally could also break July or all-time records.”Lightning storms have already caused fires and rail disruption this week during the heatwave. Network Rail warned speed restrictions may be introduced in areas where tracks are at risk of buckling.The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the industry, advised passengers in London and the South East to consider changing their travel plans on Thursday owing to the heat.Those making long car journeys cannot rely on the radio for company — FM and AM radio signals can be disrupted in hot weather because signals from local stations can travel further and cause interference outside their usual range.The Met Office has warned heatwaves are on the increase as a result of climate change. It is even possible the mercury could climb to 40 degrees, which would be “unprecedented” for the UK climate, weather forecasters said.Parts of Europe are bracing for record temperatures as the second heatwave of the summer bakes the continent.The Paris area could be as hot as 42 degrees as a result of hot, dry air coming from northern Africa.Swathes of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland could also face temperatures exceeding 40 degrees.Climate scientists have warned this could become the new normal. But temperate Europe — where air conditioning is rare — is not equipped for the kind of temperatures in the region this week.Tourists have been jumping in fountains in a bid to cool down, while authorities are looking to help those such as the elderly, who are often hit hardest by the heat.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3965156.1563909743!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"heatwave in france an overpowering smell of rubbish and avoiding the oven","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople cool off at the Trocadero Fountains in Paris.

The last time I experienced heat that intense was in Baghdad.Thursday’s peak is expected to break the previous record for the French capital of 40.4 degrees, set in 1947.“Temperatures will be stifling in big towns at night, about 25 degrees,” Frédéric Nathan, a forecaster for Météo France, told France Info radio.Last month, temperatures in the southern Gard department reached 46 degrees, another French record.In the circumstances, you might expect climate change sceptics to shut up. But no, conservative and far-right deputies in the National Assembly boycotted a speech by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old passionara of the fight against global warming, before a non-partisan parliamentary group on Tuesday. They called her the “prophetess in short trousers”, the “guru of the apocalypse” and “laureate of the Nobel fear prize”. The deputies, Thunberg replied, “are more afraid of me than of the real problem”.Earlier this month, scientists from the World Weather Attribution project reported a direct link between climate change and heat waves, which are now “at least” five times more frequent than in 1947.Eighty of France’s 96 mainland departments were on heat wave “orange alert” on Tuesday, a record. New temperature records were set in Bordeaux, Angers, Rennes and Blois. Three-quarters of France has been forced to restrict the consumption of water because a 20 per cent drop in rainfall has created a drought. In parts of France, it hasn’t rained for a month. Streams are running dry. The electricity company has stopped two nuclear power plants because the river water used as coolant is too hot.Temperatures this week are roughly equivalent to the 2003 heatwave, though the 2003 heatwave lasted longer. According to the health and medical research institute Inserm, it caused 19,490 deaths in France, mostly among the elderly, and close to 70,000 across Europe.Those early deaths were attributed to official negligence. No government has been caught out since. The authorities provide air conditioned community rooms, leave parks open at night and set up temporary fountains and mist machines. The ministry of health has a toll-free heatwave hotline. Volunteers call on elderly citizens to make sure they drink enough water.Because high temperatures raise ozone levels, only the least polluting vehicles are allowed to circulate.Walking around the city in daylight hours, one feels as if one is being irradiated. The heat magnifies bad odours. Paris is still beautiful, but the smell of urine and garbage can be overpowering.I stocked up on mineral water, ice cream, sorbet, gazpacho, taking care not to buy anything that requires lighting the oven. I’ve adopted the routine my mother taught me, on the edge of the Californian desert. I open all windows at night, close them and draw the curtains in early morning.My greatest concern is for Spike, my frail, 19-year-old Irish moggy with his thick fur coat. During the 2015 heatwave, Spike had an epileptic fit. It was terrifying to watch my friend bob across the floor with bulging eyes. I pleaded with the vet to come quickly, and he injected Spike with water. Now I serve him chilled water from the fridge several times a day, and keep an electric fan pointed at him.I obtained the concierge’s blessing to move Spike to the ground floor entry, which is cooler, before the thermostat hits 40. I’ll take him down in the morning with his litter tray, food, water, rug and fan. My neighbours have all fled the city, so I will leave the door of the apartment open. Spike can wander upstairs if he gets lonely.I experienced a previous record-breaking drought and heatwave, in the summer of 1976, with the insouciance of a teenager on her first great adventure. Then, it seemed like a good excuse to indulge in ice cream and sit out on cafe terraces until late evening. I always remembered that 1976 became a grand millésime vintage year for Bordeaux wine.But with what we know now of global warming, high temperatures and water shortages have taken on a sinister meaning the chronicle of a death foretold, the death of our planet.One cannot help being astounded by the snide remarks of right-wing politicians regarding Thunberg’s aptly timed visit to Paris. “We have entered into a new era,” says Frédéric Nathan of Météo France. “This will be more and more frequent in coming decades. It will become the norm.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Politician became country\u0026rsquos first freely elected president in decadesTaliban claims responsibility for strike on Afghan

This could include students who have been in care, who are from a deprived area or who have been to a poorly performing school.   A survey of 1,035 undergraduates, conducted by Hepi and YouthSight, found that 45 per cent oppose the use of contextual offers.Students at the most selective Russell Group universities were more likely to support lower grade offers, with 36 per cent saying they were against them.   Over a quarter (29 per cent) of those polled felt that making lower offers to their peers from deprived backgrounds would make it harder for “students like me” to get into university.  Meanwhile, 39 per cent said that students admitted with lower grades would not be able to keep up academically with the course requirements.The survey also found that nearly three quarters of students thought university admissions should take account of an applicant\u0027s background.Poor pupils with one B and two Cs at A-Level should be considered for places at Oxbridge, the OfS said“There has been a temptation for universities to run systems of contextual offers somewhat under the radar in order to avoid negative reactions,” the Hepi report said.  “However, meeting the fair access targets set on institutions will likely necessitate significant growth in contextual admissions. So it remains important to earn support among students and the public.”  Universities are under pressure from the higher education watchdog to admit more students from ethnic minorities and disadvantaged backgrounds.Earlier this year, the Office for Students (OfS) said poor pupils with one B and two Cs at A-Level should be considered for places at Oxbridge to increase ersity in top institutions. The regulator claimed so-called contextual offers give bright students from deprived areas a route into university, without risking a fall in academic standards.It suggested England’s higher education sector needed to be “more ambitious” with how it handles applications from candidates with deprived backgrounds, similar to US and Scottish institutions.However, the watchdog has also admitted that top universities will need to accept fewer middle class students in order to meet ersity targets. Russell Group institutions must eliminate the gap in admissions between wealthier students and their less well-off peers within 20 years, according to OfS targets.But in order to achieve this, they will need to “considerably reduce” the number of students they admit from well-off backgrounds, the regulator’s analysis found.Nick Hillman, director of Hepi, said that universities have been hesitant to publicise the fact that they are giving lower offers to disadvantage students because they fear students are averse to the practise.  Giving disadvantaged applicants lower entry offers is one of the most controversial things that universities do,” he said.  “Students will be worried that the person sitting next to them in the lecture hall has been let in on an easier criteria.Our results are mixed – there is a lot of sympathy for lowering offers but it is about half-half. So there is still considerable work to be done on winning over hearts and minds.  The OfS said there was ample evidence of stark educational gaps between the most and least advantaged young people.Chris Millward, its director for fair access and participation, said that universities need to make “significant changes” to ensure their admissions process looks “beyond grades to identify merit, recognising the potential of talented candidates from under-represented backgrounds who have so much to offer to their fellow students, university community and wider society”.Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

It highlights the the company’s key strength. It still has the capability to deliver mass\u0026nbspaudiences to advertisers in a way that’s almost unique. Love Island is beloved by the\u0026nbspmuch\u0026nbspcoveted 16- to 34-year-old\u0026nbspdemographic that is usually\u0026nbspin thrall to Netflix and YouTube. There’s nothing currently about that rivals the show’s\u0026nbsppopularity among its members.\u0026nbspITV boss criticises ‘simplifying link’ between Love Island and suicideLove Island to air twice in 2020 as winter series announced by ITV2Love Island: Counselling offered to contestants’ families by ITVBut Love Island also highlights the company’s weakness. Without it, where would ITV be?\u0026nbspOK, that’s a little unfair. There’s more to the company than just its most high-profile show.\u0026nbspThe main reason for the company’s shares taking flight was, in fact, because its results weren’t anything like as bad as the City had feared, and the company’s guidance had prepped it for.\u0026nbspBut despite Love Island and other hit shows, ad revenues were still down\u0026nbspby 5 per cent, ditto overall revenues, off by 7 per cent.\u0026nbspThe latter was in part because the money that its content producer ITV Studios brings in comes in fits and starts. There’ll be a lot more of it in the second half this year.The ads were partly down because of the UK’s awful political situation, but ITV still faces the long-term problem of them shifting online, taking its biggest revenue stream with them. It’s a process that looks set to carry on\u0026nbspeven if the broadcaster continues to find hits such as the aforementioned reality show or Bodyguard, or its other winning properties.To be fair, CEO Carolyn McCall has been actively pursuing ways to address the issue and ITV Digital’s offerings have done well on her watch. It delivered an 18 per cent rise in turnover this time around.\u0026nbspThere’s also the forthcoming BritBox streaming venture, in partnership with the BBC.\u0026nbspIt’s already in the US, where it has been doing well. ITV is now putting a great deal of effort into launching it on this side of the pond.\u0026nbspBut there are questions. The £5.99 monthly price tag is competitive (although the initially rumoured £5 might have ultimately delivered still more subscribers), and it is marketing distinctively British content.\u0026nbspBut it will, at least at first, be reliant on back catalogue, at a time when its partner is looking to extend the free iPlayer window to a year.\u0026nbspThe latter’s stake is only 10 per cent, with an option to raise it. That looks like a less than wholehearted commitment that could easily be jettisoned.\u0026nbspNetflix has become a juggernaut through investing billions in new content – as much as $15bn a year. Britbox is getting £65m over two (although that’s net of forecast subscriptions), and there’ll be no standalone shows at launch. Does it have enough to secure a niche as an additional extra, a second streaming subscription, which is the pitch, amid an increasingly crowded field?\u0026nbspIt’s worthy of note that Netflix is finding resistance from consumers to its price rises. They only have so much to spend.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

But there are plenty of other reasons that employees might feel welcome\u0026nbsphere, from the breakout areas populated by stuffed Shaun the Sheep, to the well-tended\u0026nbspgardens, where Nick Park often sits, pondering his latest creations, to the walls and cabinets lined with Baftas, Oscars and Cannes Lions for Wallace and Gromit and many of the other Aardman creations that are printed\u0026nbspin the memory of any British child of the Nineties.\u0026nbspLast year, those employees had one more reason to stay. On 10 November\u0026nbsp2018, the company announced that its founders, Peter Lord and Dave\u0026nbspSproxton, were selling 75 per cent of shares to a trust that would hold them on behalf of employees, turning Aardman into an employee-owned company.Stephanie Owen, a senior producer and trustee director, first heard about the plan at the company’s annual review in April last year. She had plenty of questions about employee ownership, which is still less well known than other company structures, but mostly, she felt proud.\u0026nbsp“I felt incredibly emotional and rather proud to be part of a company where the owners were taking such a bold and generous step to ensure the company’s legacy continued in the hands of the people who care so much about it –\u0026nbspthe partners, as we are now all called,” Owen\u0026nbspremembers.How one cooperative is improving lives with food in PrestonWhy co-operatives could be the answer to the UK’s social care crisisThere are now more than 370 employee-owned businesses in the UK and 200,000 employee-owners. The sector is still small, but has grown rapidly since the 2012 Nuttall review by the government, which encouraged the creation of employee-owned businesses as a way to ersify industry\u0026nbspafter the financial crisis.\u0026nbspAfter the Nuttall review, the government created two types of tax relief for employee-owned businesses. The first offers relief from capital gains tax for company owners\u0026nbspwho decide to sell their business to an employee-ownership trust. The second provides an income tax exemption for employees, allowing them to receive a tax-free bonus of up to £3,600 annually.This week, the Employee Ownership Association and Co-operatives UK joined together to call on the government to invest £2m\u0026nbspin the spending review to support the voluntary expansion of employee and worker-owned businesses.\u0026nbspThey point to evidence that shows that as UK productivity has declined, the productivity of the top employee-owned firms is rising by 7 per cent a year. Ed Mayo, secretary general of Co-operatives UK, says: “When it comes to reducing wealth inequality, driving employee engagement and tackling regional resilience, employee and worker ownership offers a proven solution.”Upstairs at Aardman, Dave Sproxton keeps a business book on his desk that partly inspired his decision: Beyond the Corporation: Humanity Working\u0026nbspby David Erdal, the chair of Tullis Russell, a paper manufacturing company based in Scotland. Erdal designed and led the employee buyout of the company, which was completed in 1994.Sproxton had been thinking and talking about succession plans for Aardman since 2013. The seeds of his interest in employee ownership were\u0026nbspsown much earlier when, as a geography undergraduate, he studied under a Marxist professor. “The tendency of\u0026nbspa company like ours with intellectual property of value is to get swallowed by Endemol, Disney or somewhere, who then take the properties and make them in another country,” he says. “About five employees go with them and the rest find themselves out of a job.”Sproxton dismissed the idea of becoming a cooperative, which gives every worker an equal share in the business, believing that it might not work in such a commercial environment. He landed on employee ownership through a trust, which is managed separately through a board. This model does not convey the same voting rights as full cooperative ownership, but can make employees a more active part of managing the business. “The culture of the place was already collaborative, as film-making is, so when an employee-ownership structure was mooted, I thought that could be a way forward,” he says.Aardman Animations at 40Now the transfer of shares is complete, Sproxton is focussing his attention on appointing a new managing director to replace him, so that he can move into a consultancy role. Meanwhile Peter Lord will remain creative director, working on a Shaun the Sheep movie due out later this year and Chicken Run 2, which is in development.“We’re not quitting yet,” the founders said in the statement announcing the new company structure. “But we are preparing for our future. This approach is the best solution we have found for keeping Aardman doing what it does best, keeping the teams in place and providing continuity for our highly creative culture. And of course, those that create value in the company will continue to benefit directly from the value they create.”Since the transition, Stephanie Owen has been elected by her colleagues to represent them at the executive board and the trustee board. The role is a step up from the previous workers’ council and has given employees more of a hand in shaping the business – including helping to choose a successor to\u0026nbspSproxton as managing director. “There is a new air of excitement and positive energy that the EO transition has brought,” Owen says. “There is also a sense of responsibility in the knowledge that ‘it’s our Aardman’ now and we all have a part to play in making it the best it can be.”wallis and gromit\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018The maker of electric cars also said it began preparations for the production of its Model Y, an all-electric SUV.When the model was unveiled in March, Mr Musk promised that it will ride “like a sports car” and will be “the safest mid-size SUV in the world by far”.The Model Y may become Tesla’s most important money spinner, given how popular SUVs have become in the US, Europe and Canada. Most SUVs still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.The pressure on Tesla to become sustainably profitable is intense. Repeated large losses since its inception\u0026nbspand capital raising have\u0026nbspleft the company with a\u0026nbsphuge debt pile: it stood at $11.4bn at the end of the second quarter.Whether Tesla will move into the black this year is in doubt –\u0026nbspmany analysts think it will struggle to meet its 2019 deliveries target of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.The US has reduced its tax incentive for electric car purchases and will phase it out entirely at the end of the year.But Tesla faces an even deeper problem, as Clement Thibault, an analyst at Investing, pointed out. “Does it matter how many cars you sell, if you can’t make a profit on them?”Tesla’s shares have lost more than 20 per cent of their value this year, while the Standard \u0026amp Poor’s 500 index has surged by as much.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A phone known as D42 will replace the iPhone XS, one known as D43 will replace the iPhone XS Max, and one called N104 will come in the place of the iPhone XR.Last year was the first time Apple released its iPhones in this line-up, with a large and small version of the premium model and then a cheaper medium-sized version. That same set-up looks set to be in place this year, according to the leak.Perhaps the most notable feature of the new phone is what won\u0027t change. The new phones are said to feature a Lightning port like the existing phones, rather than swapping to the USB-C that arrived on the iPad Pro last year and has long been rumoured to be coming to kill off the Lightning port as a charger.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

That will be a large block of lenses that will feature three cameras arranged into a square shape.iPhone users urged to update old devices to latest iOS softwareThe third lens – a first for the iPhone – will include a new lens that will be able to take wide-angle photos, the report suggested. As well as letting people take wider photos, that will allow for a new feature called Smart Frame which will capture data outside of a traditional photo so that users can change the framing of it by using that same data.The front-facing camera will also receive an upgrade.They will also kill off one major feature, known as 3D Touch, which allowed people to press their phone screen harder and get new menu options. That was introduced on the iPhone 6s but never came to the iPads or the iPhone XR, and the new phones will also drop it – making way for similar tools that will be enabled by software, the report claimed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018That\u0027s why it\u0027s important that devices like iPhones shut down when they detect they have gone over their temperature. But that does not stop it being any more frustrating when it does.New iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakWhen phones do shut down, they will show an error message that tells their user that the phone won\u0027t work until it has cooled down again.iPhones are made\u0026nbspto operate between zero and 35-degrees Celsius. That measure refers to the temperature around the phone, however, rather than the phone itself – meaning that they may shut down more quickly even if the ambient temperature is lower, and might not do so immediately even when the weather is a little hotter.If a phone is left out in the sun, for instance, it will get warm much more quickly and might shut down. And by the same measure, if it is able to cool in a hot room by being left out on a cold surface, it might be able to keep running even when the outside temperature would appear to be too hot.The phones can also be stored in places that are up to 45-degrees celsius, according to Apple. But they can\u0027t be\u0026nbspused\u0026nbspat that temperature, only kept there.Cooling a phone down to make it start working again can be done just like any other object: put it somewhere cool, move it out of direct sunlight, and in extreme cases you can hold it next to something cold like a bottle of water. It can also be useful to take it out of its case, since they can store up the heat and work like a blanket wrapped around it.But it can also be helpful to stop it getting that warm in the first place. That can be done by keeping it out of direct heat, but also minimising the amount of work it is doing on the inside – avoiding intensive processes like playing games, downloading files, and other taxing activities.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But why not use this technology to save today’s struggling ecosystems and habitats,\u0026nbspasks Ashley Coates\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentFew people enjoying a walk on Scotland’s coast today know that it is missing a fascinating animal:\u0026nbspa charismatic, large, flightless seabird that is Britain’s very own dodo.\u0026nbspIn July 1840, Britain’s last great auks were killed on the island of St Kilda. Having been captured alive, the islanders decided the birds were witches that had brought on a storm and they were promptly stoned to death.The demise of the auk is one of the saddest episodes in the history of our interactions with nature. The auks went from flocks of millions to a single breeding pair, caught by Icelandic fishermen in June 1844, when the very last egg was accidentally crushed in the effort to capture and kill the adults.\u0026nbspOur guilt over the violent end of such an impressive species is one of the reasons the auks are a candidate for de-extinction, and why de-extinction has such a strong appeal in general.The idea of bringing back any species from the dead elicits reactions of excitement at the chance to see live animals we thought we had lost forever and perhaps the opportunity to right the wrongs inflicted by mankind on the natural world. Having caused the demise of these animals ourselves, usually through hunting or habitat loss, surely it is our duty to restore them and in-so-doing the ecosystems they used to inhabit?Yet de-extinction has always been met with a certain amount of queasiness about what the restoration of an extinct species would mean for nature and for our place within it. The moral implications seem uncertain. With humans now determining the weather, the rate of habitat loss, and with it the rate of extinction, are we already influencing evolutionary processes enough without bringing animals back from the dead?Do we need to have herds of mammoths wandering around today and how can we expect them to survive in a world where their habitats are shrinking and so many living species are at risk of extinction?Antón)Twenty-six years on from the original Jurassic Park, the arguments against reviving extinct species have not changed since Ian Malcolm, the maverick mathematician played by Jeff Goldblum, chastised theme park owner John Hammond for bringing back the dinosaurs.\u0026nbsp“Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u0027t stop to think if they should,” he says.What has changed is our real-life capability to bring back the long-lost species that have died under our watch, creatures like the auk, the woolly mammoth and the passenger pigeon. Some scientists working on “resurrection biology” believe we may be as little as a decade away from bringing back some of these icons of extinction.Unfortunately for fans of the Jurassic Park franchise, nobody is expecting to see a tyrannosaur roaming around a Costa Rican island any time soon. In Michael Crichton’s book (and later in the 1993 film), dinosaur blood preserved inside a mosquito that had become encased in amber was the source of the DNA needed to create the dinosaurs that featured in the theme park.Gerrard Keulemans)There has been a mosquito found in 45-million-year-old lake sediments which retained haemoglobin-derived porphyrins – products from the breakdown of haemoglobin, lending at least a degree of credence to the fiction. Fibres and cellular structures preserved in 75-million–year-old dinosaur specimens were reported by palaeontologists back in 2015 and scientists continue to look for remnants of living matter in dinosaur bones.Just last month, scientists from the renowned Field Museum in Chicago found modern living microbes “having a jolly good time” inside the bones of a 75-million-year-old centrosaurus, but this discovery further supports the consensus that it will be hard for proteins and DNA material to survive the ravages of time. Despite an array of fascinating finds, the oldest DNA found so far was around one million years old, fully 65 million years after the last of the dinosaurs.Even with the possibility of elements of blood cells, collagen or other organic matter being preserved in the fossil record, the chances of finding intact DNA are remote. DNA breaks down over time, particularly after exposure to water, meaning it is extremely unlikely if not impossible that a full or partial genome from anything living before 65 million years ago would still be around today.But there are a number of more recently extinct species that are up for consideration as candidates for de-extinction, including some of T Rex’s closest modern relatives.Revive and Restore, a US non-profit working exclusively to bring back a number of lost species, is focusing efforts on the passenger pigeon, a once common North American bird that dramatically disappeared at the beginning of the last century.The idea that the passenger pigeon might go extinct would have seemed extraordinary to the Americans who once spoke of flocks of many millions blocking out the sky as the pigeons migrated across the north eastern United States. Writing in 1813, the celebrated American ornithologist, John James Audubon, told his readers: “The light of noon-day was obscured as by an eclipse, the dung fell in spots, not unlike melting flakes of snow and the continued buzz of wings had a tendency to lull my senses to repose.”Each of these great migrations coincided with a mass shooting of the birds, both for food and for feathers.\u0026nbspThe speed with which the passenger pigeon then went extinct was phenomenal. Scientists now believe the species was prone to “cycles of boom and bust” without human interference but even so, reducing a population of around three billion to zero within a few decades is remarkable even by the standards of today’s extinctions. September 1914. The last wild passenger pigeon is believed to have been shot 13 years earlier.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe approach being developed by Ben Novak and the team at Revive and Restore is to take the genome of the passenger pigeon’s closest living relative, the band-tailed pigeon, and insert characteristics from the genome of the extinct passenger pigeon, a process that could be applied to a wide range of lost species.\u0026nbsp What you end up with is not a fully restored passenger pigeon, but a hybrid version of the two species, a band-tailed pigeon which looks and acts like a passenger pigeon.According to Tom Maloney, Revive and Restore’s director of conservation science:\u0026nbsp“You find a species that is the closest living relative and then conduct a process of comparative genomics to find where the traits are that need to be changed.\u0026nbspWe can find the traits for the red breast, or the long tail, what is not known is how much behaviour was learned, how much was culture within the species, and those are some of the tangible issues that are still uncertain”.The return of a particularly significant species such as\u0026nbspthe passenger pigeon could have benefits for other species. Where a habitat has lost an animal or plant that was important for the way the ecosystem functioned, the very act of bringing them back may also result in the restoration, or stabilisation of, the ecosystems that are currently missing them.“We are moving away from the idea that you are bringing back a woolly mammoth in its entirety,” Tom Maloney says, “and more towards modifying the Asian elephant to fill the ecological niche left by the woolly mammoth 10,000 years ago”.We are moving away from the idea that you are bringing back a woolly mammoth in its entirety, and more towards modifying the Asian elephant to fill the ecological niche left by the woolly mammoth 10,000 years ago“What we and the IUCN\u0026nbsp{International Union for the Conservation of Nature} bring to this is a thoughtful consideration of the factors that led to extinction, and more importantly the functional role of the animal in the ecosystem, such as restoring mammoths to the permafrost or passenger pigeons to the forests of North America.”Critics of de-extinction point to the need to focus our efforts on saving animals that are alive today but what has emerged out of the work led by Revive and Restore is the potential to use gene editing techniques to save today’s vulnerable species. If you can modify a band-tailed pigeon to look like a passenger pigeon, why not use the same technology to modify coral to survive temperature changes as the seas continue to warm, or amphibians to survive the fungal disease that is currently decimating their populations in South America?Helen Pilcher,\u0026nbspauthor of Bring Back the King: the New Science of De-extinction, highlights the northern white rhino as the sort of species that could benefit from this approach. Functionally extinct, the last male northern white rhino died in 2014, leaving only two females. Techniques such as those being developed by Revive and Restore could provide the means to prevent the rhinos from being lost forever.de-extintion\u0026nbspto species that need it, like the white rhino (AFPGetty)“You can call it de-extinction or you can call it conservation, but I think it is two sides of the same coin. I certainly think we should consider bringing back fully extinct species, but in the first instance it should be applied to species that really need our help like the black-footed ferret or the kakapo, or the northern white rhino.”“I am very much in favour of Revive and Restore’s attitude, that we have this emerging suite of technologies which we can apply to species which are essentially extinct if we don’t come up with new technologies. That for me is the most exciting part of this work.”This form of gene editing is now emerging as the most viable, or at least the most discussed, means to “de-extinct” a species. Elsewhere in the world, researchers have managed to employ different techniques and with encouraging results.Lydekker)In 2003, Jose Folch and his team at the centre for Agro-Nutrition Research and Technology (Spain), became the first people in the world to successfully recover a lost species after they cloned cells from the skin of the last of the bucardos, also known as the Pyrenean ibex. A sub-species of the Spanish ibex, the bucardos suffered from years of hunting before the last of its kind tragically died after a tree fell on it. The DNA of this female animal was inserted into the eggs of domestic goats before being implanted into the wombs of the goats and a few female Spanish ibexes.Fully 208 ibex were implanted with embryos, seven became pregnant and one successfully delivered a new-born bucardo, which died of respiratory failure after only a few minutes. Despite this setback, the project was considered a success in the field and remains the only time an extinct species has been brought back to life, albeit very briefly.Gone and back againOsprey: one of the most impressive bird species in the UK, the osprey went extinct in England in 1840 and in Scotland in 1916. This was largely as a result of the Victorian interest in egg collecting, taxidermy and plumage. Today\u0027s birds are the result of both naturally colonising breeding pairs and re-introduced birds.\u0026nbspGreat bustard: the world\u0027s heaviest flying bird was hunted to extinction in England in 1832. The Great Bustard Group has\u0026nbspbeen releasing hundreds of bustard chicks on to Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire since 2004 and it is hoped that the population will be increased to sustainable levels.\u0026nbspBeavers: these were hunted to extinction in Britain in the 16th century, for pelts and a prized oil they secrete. In 2009 they were reintroduced in Scotland, and a trial to manage beavers on the River Otter in Devon is underway.Hen-harrier: the government has launched a hen-harrier action plan to protect the final few pairs breeding in England, where it is feared they will be persecuted to extinction. Conservationists are using satellite monitoring and 24-hour nest protection.Wild boar have twice been made extinct outside of captivity in Britain – the result of over-hunting in the 13th and 17th centuries. Escapees from farms have repopulated the Forest of Dean, while release programmes have had success elsewhere.Unlike the passenger pigeon or the bucardo, the keepers at Amsterdam Zoo did not know they had the very last of the quaggas until after its death in 1883. For an animal that was once so numerous, the surviving remnants of their kind are remarkably sparse. There are only three photographs of a live quagga, which\u0026nbsplived at London Zoo’s Regent’s Park site. Around 23 skins remain preserved as taxidermy worldwide.It is one of the oddities of our relationship with nature in the past two centuries that an animal which would have been common just a few generations ago is now mostly unheard of while its surviving relatives are among\u0026nbspsome of the best known and most loved animals globally.\u0026nbspA sub-species of the plains zebra, the quagga looked almost identical to modern zebras, apart from their stripes, which appear to run out before they got to its hind legs.On a genetic level, they are so similar to their surviving cousins that an innovative South African project is working to restore the species through a process known as “back breeding”. As the name suggests, this involves repeatedly breeding plains zebras that exhibit the characteristics of the quagga (most notably the lack of hind stripes) until you have an animal that at least resembles the quagga to the best of our knowledge.More than 30 years into The Quagga Project, the latest Rau Quagga in the breeding programme, an animal known as Rachel, certainly looks like the quagga pictured in Victorian era-London Zoo.\u0026nbspWhichever technique is employed by scientists, de-extinction has always been looked upon with a certain amount of scepticism.\u0026nbspSince the publication of her book, Bring Back the King, Helen Pilcher has found she receives a mixed reaction when she delivers talks about the techniques used by scientists in this area.\u0026nbsp“The knee-jerk reaction of a lot of people is that scientists are playing God,” she says, “that we are taking things too far, and we should be putting money into conservation.”“If the playing God argument is that we are choosing which species can live and which can die then we have been doing that for, arguably, thousands of years. It is just that we are doing it on a bigger and much more devastating scale now.\u0026nbspYou could take the view that we are already playing God by raising the temperature of the planet, acidifying the oceans, and controlling evolution through the breeding of certain animals.”Our awareness of the bioersity crash we are bringing about is now at an all-time high. Last month, a major UN report suggested one million animal and eight million plant species are at risk of extinction, and as many as 20 species are going extinct every day.\u0026nbspThe animals that could be lost include many species that\u0026nbspsurvived the last mass extinction events: deep sea sharks, which\u0026nbsphave patrolled the abyss largely unchanged for hundreds of millions of years\u0026nbspturtles, once one of the most common large animals in the ocean are now icons of the conservation movement.Yet a surprising twist on the development of this technology in the past few years has been its potential application as a means of saving today\u0027s wildlife, both by reintroducing lost animals into fragile ecosystems, and by modifying the genomes of living species to improve their resilience. Pilcher says:\u0026nbsp“We have been altering the genes of animals for a long time and now we are in a position to speed up that process. We are changing the evolutionary trajectory of every creature on the planet. Scientists can now look at ecosystems and identify what is missing and restore that element.What animal would you bring back if you could? For me I thought it would be something like the dodo or the woolly mammoth because who wouldn’t want to see one? But in the end the animal I would most like to see de-extinct is one that is still alive, and it is the northern white rhino“I am in favour of developing the technology at least until\u0026nbspthe point where we can establish how useful it will be, but I don’t think we are there yet.”It is the application of technology directly that troubles some, perhaps because there is something unnerving about “meddling” with nature’s intended path.\u0026nbspThe rebuttal to that –\u0026nbspwhich is that we are already altering the course of life on Earth anyway, and gene editing is just another way of doing the same thing –\u0026nbspis an uncomfortable idea to accept. Many of us take solace in nature because of its seeming constancy, and apparent separateness from our own lives, and coming to terms with the extent of human influence in natural processes is difficult. Nevertheless, all the scientists in the field advocate a cautious approach to what is still very much a frontier science.Another criticism of de-extinction is the perception that it is a fringe science obsessed with the restoration of animals like the mammoth and the auk, for the wow factor as much as anything else, but it’s the potential of using this technology to save today’s struggling ecosystems that has emerged has perhaps the most useful application of the science, if and when it comes to fruition.“The most convincing argument for de-extinction is that we look at it as a tool of conservation,” says\u0026nbspPilcher.“I started my last book with the question: what animal would you bring back if you could? For me I thought it would be something like the dodo or the woolly mammoth because it would be amazing and who wouldn’t want to see one? But in the end the animal I would most like to see de-extinct is one that is still alive, and it is the northern white rhino.”The technology is still being perfected but, in the meantime, we need to build a better awareness of how the science can be used to save today’s threatened species and the habitats that depend on them.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is also a clear political vibe, with commentary on Brexit, the NHS, mental health and how we communicate with each other all strong themes on many of the shortlisted entries.\u0026nbspThe shortlist follows a shake-up of the judging panel, which added Stormzy, Gaz Coombes, Annie Mac and Jorja Smith, and critic and Vice editor Tshepo Mokoena to the group of experts who will decide the winner at a ceremony later this year.See the full shortlist for this year’s Mercury Prize:Idles – Joy As An Act of Resistance\u0026nbspThe 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsFoals have been shortlisted for the third time, having previously appeared on 2013’s list with Holy Fire (losing out to James Blake – Overgrown) and 2010 with Total Life Forever, when the prize was won by The xx for their self-titled debut.\u0026nbspReviewing part one of Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost (the second half is being released this autumn), Mark Beaumont gave the album five stars and wrote: “It’s a dystopian vision becoming all the more real with every February heatwave, and Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 1 is a fitting vehicle.\u0026nbsp“Merging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2.”Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name.

There’s a strong showing for both UK rap and also an apparent surge in guitar music, with the majority of shortlisted acts making prominent use of the instrument, including Little Simz on her album GREY Area.\u0026nbspSimz and Dave’s albums were also awarded five stars apiece from The Independent. Of Psychodrama, The Independent commented: “A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity.\u0026nbsp“On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album.”This year’s “token jazz album”, as it has become known, is the 10-piece SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass, which combines South African jazz with Sixties soul and hip hop influences. The project is helmed by composer Cassie Kinoshi, who also plays alto sax in the jazz septet Nérija and in Afrobeat band Kokoroko. Driftglass’s title is taken from writer Samuel R Delany’s image of glass fragments washed by tides, which Kinoshi adopted for the album as a metaphor for how the tides of improvisation form compositions.Notable omissions include James Blake\u0027s Assume Form\u0026nbspalong with albums by Florence + the Machine, AJ Tracey, Lucy Rose and previous winner Skepta. As per previous years, metal is ignored by the prize and so critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums by artists including Bring Me the Horizon, Black Peaks, Architects and Employed to Serve have been left off this year\u0027s list.\u0026nbspFoals interview: ‘Brexit feels like an act of self-harm’Little Simz interview: ‘If you get offended by me, that’s on you’Dave jokes he can ‘retire now’ following Thiago Silva shout-outGeoff Taylor, Chief Executive of BPI - home to the Hyundai Mercury Prize, said: “These 12 albums are essential listening!

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Genuinely, it helps in this business being called Rupert,” he told .\u0026nbsp“I’ve sniffed that attitude in acting: the Oxbridge thing. Making movies isn’t a cheap exercise,” said Graves. “You need money and the knock-on from that is the industry is populated by a lot of posh people. It’s very hard to break into if you’re not middle class and privately educated.”The actor, who attended\u0026nbspat a comprehensive school in Somerset,\u0026nbspalso admitted he “hated” the name Rupert as a child, adding: “Rupert is a ridiculous name in 1970s Weston-super-Mare. Ridiculous! It’s like being called Basil.”Created with Sketch.23 films to watch out for this summer  Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Need-to-know: Annie Potts returns to voice Bo Peep for the first time since Toy Story 2 (1999),Need-to-know: The film, from Todd Douglas Miller, features footage that has never been seen before.Need-to-know: Despite making his debut, Katalin Varga, in 2009, Strickland found critical acclaim with the Toby Jones-starring horror film Berberian Sound Studio in 2012.Need-to-know: Ed Sheeran and James Corden both cameo in the film that\u0027s led by Himish Patel, the actor best known (until now) for playing Tamwar Masood in EastEnders.Need-to-know: This film will bring the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u0027s third phase to an end, ushering in a new era of superheroes and films.Need-to-know: The entire film is rumoured to take place in broad daylight - unusual for a contemporary horror film.Need-to-know: Eva Green and Andrea Riseborough were both attached to play Woolf before the role eventually went to Debicki.Need-to-know: Although being R-rated in the US, the film is distributed by Disney.Need-to-know: This isn\u0027t the first zombie film Bill Murray will star in this year - in October, he\u0027ll play himself (again) in the long-awaited sequel to 2009\u0027s cult comedy Zombieland.Need-to-know: This isn\u0027t Ron Howard\u0027s first music documentary.

Another flame flew out of the top of the rocket, as can be seen on the video.The rocket itself appeared to survive without problems, but it is just the latest in a run of issues. It came a week after the Starhopper craft flew a fireball out of its bottom during another test.It was the first time that SpaceX has allowed one of the tests to be streamed.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018The maker of electric cars also said it began preparations for the production of its Model Y, an all-electric SUV.When the model was unveiled in March, Mr Musk promised that it will ride “like a sports car” and will be “the safest mid-size SUV in the world by far”.The Model Y may become Tesla’s most important money spinner, given how popular SUVs have become in the US, Europe and Canada. Most SUVs still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.The pressure on Tesla to become sustainably profitable is intense. Repeated large losses since its inception\u0026nbspand capital raising have\u0026nbspleft the company with a\u0026nbsphuge debt pile: it stood at $11.4bn at the end of the second quarter.Whether Tesla will move into the black this year is in doubt –\u0026nbspmany analysts think it will struggle to meet its 2019 deliveries target of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.The US has reduced its tax incentive for electric car purchases and will phase it out entirely at the end of the year.But Tesla faces an even deeper problem, as Clement Thibault, an analyst at Investing, pointed out. “Does it matter how many cars you sell, if you can’t make a profit on them?”Tesla’s shares have lost more than 20 per cent of their value this year, while the Standard \u0026amp Poor’s 500 index has surged by as much.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerWhen he apologised, the parliamentary standards commissioner “exercised her discretion” to deal with the matter without a referral to the standards committee, which oversees MPs’ behaviour.However, she noted it was not the first time Mr Cox had registered thousands of pounds in income later than Commons rules allow – having failed to declare £400,000 in outside earnings for legal work in 2016.It then became clear that the attorney general should have registered the income from November 2017 – “10 months earlier than the date which he had given to the commissioner” – triggering a referral.In its report, the committee says, of the two errors, “the first arose from an oversight and the second from a genuine misunderstanding”.“It accepts, as does the commissioner, that there was no intention to deceive,” the report concludes – while pointing to the need to “set a good example”.Geoffrey Cox is Brexit’s ‘codpiece’- we know what he’s covering upBrexit now depends on Geoffrey Cox, Arlene Foster and Nigel DoddsMP who claimed 49p for milk failed to declare £400,000 extra earningsCommons reject Tory MP\u0027s claim for 49 pint of milkIt states: “Mr Cox should at the earliest opportunity apologise in writing to the House, through the Committee, for having registered a financial interest late and for having, albeit unintentionally, supplied wrong information about the date at which the interest became registerable.”The attorney general will remain a key player in the Brexit drama, having been reappointed despite anger about his legal advice earlier this year – which was blamed for torpedoing Theresa May’s hopes of passing her deal.The MP for Torridge and West Devon also told cabinet colleagues last month that remaining in the Irish backstop could be like remaining “in the first circle of hell”.Entering Downing Street earlier on Thursday, asked if Mr Johnson had selected “a no-deal cabinet”, he replied: “Yes,” – setting out its commitment to leaving the EU on 31 October.Committee on Standards\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your

We don\u0027t use wings. You are like a bird, it is your body that is flying.

This means the city is unable to cool down during prolonged heatwaves.Several other French cities registered record temperatures of more than 40C on Tuesday, including Bordeaux and Brive.Many of the records were previously set during the heatwave of 2003, which resulted in the deaths of around 15,000 people in the country.Five deaths have already been attributed to the latest heatwave, including a 33-year-old homeless man in LyonFrench officials have warned people not to take non-essential journeys, while government buildings in some parts of the country have closed down.This brutal heatwave is our fault – let\u0027s not forget thatIn the UK, temperatures are expected to reach 38C on Thursday, but could reach as high as 39C\u0026nbsp- beating the national record set in 2003 of 38.5C.Extreme heatwaves will become increasingly common, according to climate scientists, who warn that human-caused climate change made such events twice as likely to occur.A landmark study\u0026nbsppublished in the wake of the 2003 heatwave blamed human activities for causing the hottest summer in Europe for more than 500 years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So let’s not pretend I don’t need the show every bit as much as the Love Islanders deserve the low-grade abuse contained in this quiz, whichtests just how closely you’ve been watching. Answers at foot of page.. Who was Curtis referring to when he said: “You are gorgeous. You are beautul. You are literally a star ”. Complete Maura’s sentence. “I’ve only ever slept with . . . ”.

In other words, both the No Deal preparation and the proposed deal must be realistic.This is where his key Brexit lieutenants Dominic Cummings and David Frost come in.They might be backroom appointments but they are as —not more — important to the success of Boris’s premiership as the Cabinet appointments he has made.Cummings is a unique figure in Westminster. He is interested in getting things done with little regard to what people think of him and the political niceties.It is thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch that Cummings has attracted something close to celebrity status in political circles. Cumberbatch played Cummings in the TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War.He captured brilliantly Cummings’ drive and determination to win as the campaign chief for Vote Leave, and the fact he doesn’t care whose ego he ruffles in the process.In his new job, Cummings’ determination is already clear.Yesterday he was meant to be on the operating table under general anaesthetic.But once the offer came from Boris, he cancelled the operation. I am told he won’t have it done now until after October , Boris’s deadline for getting Brexit done.Cummings came in because the chance of getting the Vote Leave team back together to deliver Brexit after three years of drt simply had to be taken. The big challenge for this team is to get the UK ready for a No Deal Brexit.Cummings is well suited to his task. He knows how Whitehall works and how to succeed despite intense opposition he drove through Michael Gove’s Free Schools, which have proved hugely successful, against the objections of the educational establishment.Strikingly, in Boris’s new Government it is now Gove who is in charge of the No Deal planning.Getting the logistics and the necessary contingency plans sorted is one aspect of No Deal planning, and one that was shamefully neglected under Mrs May. But there also needs to be a political strategy for it.Many in the EU are convinced — thanks to the antics of Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond and co — that Parliament will block No Deal.Or thatthe UK did leave without a deal on Halloween, it would come crawling back by Christmas.So they reckon there is no need to compromise as No Deal either won’t happen or will be only a temporary affair.The best way to deal with both the Parliamentary opposition to No Deal and the belief that the UK would come crawling back is for Boris to take a lead in the polls.If it was clear that a general election would lead to a majority for Boris, then Parliament would be less likely to throw obstacles in his way.That’s why Boris, in his Downing Street speech, tried to address the issues that cost the Tories their majority in : Social care, schools funding and police cuts.If the EU thought that Boris could do No Deal, and could politically sustain it, then it would have to decide whether it was prepared to compromise to avoid No Deal.The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, would have to decide whether it is worth sticking with a backstop that is going to cause the very thing it was meant to avoid, a hard border on the island of Ireland.Varadkar would also have to consider whether he really wants to go through with No Deal when it would do more damage to the Irish economy than the UK’s. This is where David Frost comes in.No, not the late, great TV personality but the former Foreign Office diplomat who is going to be Boris’s point man for negotiations with the EU.Frost knows his way round the chancelleries of Europe, he is a former Foreign Office Europe Director and he also knows what Boris wants on Brexit.He was his special adviser when Boris was Foreign Secretary and was there when Boris decided to quit over Mrs May’s Chequers plan.His role is to craft a Brexit agreement that delivers what Boris thinks the UK needs AND one that has a chance of being accepted by the EUthe alternative is No Deal. This isn’t going to be easy, and it isn’t going to be done quickly.Those involved admit thatthe EU is going to blink, it will not be until the October EU Council at the earliest, which is just two weeks away from the October  deadline. As one of those working in the new No puts it: “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.”But after years in which the EU thought they had the measure of the British Prime Minister, we now have a team who might just have what it takes to pull Brexit back from the brink. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There, they can enrol in a course on gender studies and emerge in three years with a degree which will not help them one bit to get a decent job.And as a consequence they will be at least £, in debt. But they’ll have a piece of paper which will tell possible employers: “Look — I’ve been a total mug for three years. Gizza job!”The unemployment rate for students at Britain’s worst universities, such as East London and London South Bank, is around about double the national rate for young people.In other words, going to university worsened their chances of getting a job.That’s not what they were led to believe, is it. They were told a university degree would open doors for them. Not slam the doors shut in their spotty faces. And leave them with a whopping loan to pay off.Our young people have been conned for far too long.We have a new Prime Minister now. And I think it would be a good ideahe took a very close look at higher education. OK, he’s got Brexit to sort out first, fine. But by November , this should be his priority.We are misleading our young people. Far too many -year-olds go to university and end up mired in debt, with rotten degrees in stupid subjects. While all students have to scrimp and save to get through their three years.Here’s what I would doI were Education Secretary.End all tuition fees right now. Make university education absolutely free, and make sure those who go get decent living grants.How do we pay for that  Easy. Cut the number of people going to university by  per cent. Not everyone is academically minded. University should be only for those who are.Back when I went to uni only ten per cent of my peer group got in.But for the rest there were apprenticeships. Learning in the workplace. And those sorts of options should be considered not inferior to university, but absolutely equal. And the benefits stressed to the kids.Three years after leaving school a university kid will be earning nothing. If you’ve been on an apprenticeship for three years you’ll be earning a decent whack.We have over-stressed the importance and attraction of a college education to our young people, given them unrealistic expectations and made them pay through the nose for it. And at the same time we’ve devalued education by doing this.So there’s the challenge, Boris. Get on to the private sector and get some more apprenticeships up and running.And close down the awful former polytechnics charging a king’s ransom for a crap degree.ONE of the best things about BoJo becoming Prime Minister is that the perpetually screeching Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has vowed to leave the country.Brown loathes the white English working class.So it was always a mystery to me why she stayed in the country. Seeing as there are quite a lot of white, English, working-class people.Anyway, she vowed to get the hell outJohnson became PM.Trouble is, people say stuff like this but rarely act on it.I suggest we set up a crowdfunding page for her plane ticket and maybe throw in some extra money for en-route snacks and stuff.Off you go to Heathrow, Yazza.I MADE a list a few weeks ago about the  things I most dislike in the world.At No was Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.At No was Taylor Swt.And No was cats .So take a guess as to what new film I’m not going to be watching any time soon It’s my nightmare, all wrapped up in two hours.CARL BEECH made a series of outrageous claims of sexual abuse, torture and murder by members of the old Conservative establishment.This serial liar and fantasist will soon be sentenced for his crimes.The reason the police believed this madman is because they have been told they must.

Even as an adult, its easy to put your tongue in these bottles messing around.I think all bottles should have a gauze or something to stop this happening again - and Sainsburys should also recall [those that dont].After being taken to Lancaster Royal Infirmary, his mum admits she still had no idea how serious the accident was - until doctors warned they would need specialist surgeons.We went in to AE and a nurse couldnt loosen it either. Riley was really upset and screaming.A doctor managed to get the bottle off, then it was just the lid stuck on his tongue.There were about four specialists and  doctors at the end of his bed discussing what to do.He said they were going to operate but they didnt knowwed need to be sent to Alder Hey Hospital. They didnt have the equipment.They didnt want to take to Alder Hey by ambulance because it was an hour and a half away from us. And they didnt want to risk Riley having dficulty breathing in the ambulance as they wouldnt be able to save him.The doctors said this is a real risk. The risks are he could lose his breathing when we cut the lid off. The swelling could go down his throat and he may need a tracheotomy, which would land him in intensive care.He also said he had a big risk of heart attack because when the tongue is released, all the blood would circulate quickly and one of the major veins is in there.The surgeons said this is really serious. We need to warn you he could die.They took him up to theatre and managed to sedate him, not put him to sleep.They took the bottle off and he managed to handle his airways fine.When the brave patient came out of surgery, his tongue was so swollen he couldnt put it back in his mouth.After an overnight stay he was discharged, but days later his tongue is still peeling and swollen, leaving him with a speech impediment.A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We are investigating this isolated incident with our supplier and wish Riley a speedy recovery.”"},{"url":null,"title":"worlds worst tattoos think

Chief Tim Roache warned: “We’re watching you, Boris. No-deal Brexit will bring ­political Armageddon. Boris offers no hope to workers.” Harry Picken, , of Barnes, South West London, has just graduated from Lancaster University in history and politics. He said: “Boris represents everything wrong about society. “He is not someone [to] be trusted. He was part of a campaign that lied. He doesn’t intend to unite the country.”    Christine Golding, education convenor for the GMB and chair of the National School Committee, said: “When I found out Boris was going to be Prime Minister, I was angry. “His record doesn’t come across as someone listening to us. I want to know what he’s going to do for education. I work with people who have two jobs and still can’t afford to live. How is he going to help  We’ve been decimated in schools. Is he going to put money back in  Of course he’s not.” And teacher Sophie Ingram, , from Suffolk, said: “I’m scared for the future. I have to teach ‘British values’ of tolerance and respect and Boris is not the poster boy for that.  The children I teach are scared too. Tory austerity has meant some teachers feed pupils and even their parents.” Our passengers made it clear that as we buckle up for a bumpy ride with Boris, we must hold him to account. The Mirror will not let him use lies to steer us down the wrong road. Paul Routledgeaposs view The top deck of the Mirror Boris Lie Buster bus was the coolest place in London. We caught the breeze while our Boris lookalike was shooting it. Tourists gawped, motorists hooted their horns in support and sightseers even thought he was the real thing. Three years ago the Johnson bus lied to take us out of the EU. Yesterday the Mirror Liebuster bus told the truth. Our Boris exposed the porkies in songs like I’m The King Of The Bungle and It had To Be Eu-Who-Who… On College Green by Westminster we even got a wave from hardline Tory Brexiteer Nigel Evans MP. Army veterans obviously thought our PM was the real deal because they shouted: “Don’t forget your promises.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alastair campbell i know what","story":"NewsopinionAlastair Campbell: I know what it takes to be PM and it wont end well for BorisBoris is lazy.

As his career burnt in the ashes of a party ­management tactic – the EU ­referendum – he was destined to go down as the worst Prime ­Minister of modern times. Three years later, he is only the third worst. He lost the referendum. Theresa May failed to deliver on the result. Despite her “legacy tour” and though there is some “poisoned chalice” sympathy, she ­nonetheless left office having failed in virtually everything she set out to do. The burning injustices still burn. Brexit has not been ­delivered.  Now Boris Johnson takes over. I see no way that can end well for him or, more importantly, for Britain. I predict he will be even worse than his predecessors.    Those of us on the losing side of political arguments right now must be humble enough to admit we could be wrong, and that he may prove us all wrong. But I have known Johnson for a long time. First, as fellow ­journalists. Then, with him covering the government I worked for. Then, with both of us on the political front line. Now, with me as a commentator cum anti-Brexit campaigner and him as Prime Minister. It is hard to compute.  Because I can think of no other senior position being filled by someone so unqualied to do the job, especially at this crucial time for the country. Older readers may remember when a businessman called Michael Knighton took over Manchester United. When I think of Johnson, I think of Knighton ball-juggling at Old Trafford. I am currently – thank God, given what is happening back home – in Australia.    And the general impression I get from Aussies is that they think, what with Brexit and now Johnson, the Mother Country has gone bonkers.   In his head, Johnson is Winston Churchill. In truth, he is a pound-shop Trump. He lies with the same ease as the US President. Like Trump, he seeks credit for anything good. Think London Olympics, in which he played a minor role but used it to promote himself, as he does with everything he touches. Like Trump, he shts blame when it should be his. Think the failed vanity projects, like his island airport or his garden bridge. And also, think of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe languishing in Iranian jails and psychiatric units while the man, who made it so much worse for her, enters Downing Street to take charge of UK foreign policy.  He is lazy. That doesn’t mean he can’t put in the hours. But they are devoted to the game of politics and media, not the hard graft of policy and delivery. He is dismissive of detail. He is loose with his language as well as his morals. He is a bad judge of character. He is untrustworthy. He has no moral compass or fixed beliefs – hence writing two articles, one for Remain, one for Leave, before deciding that his own interests in the referendum were best served by backing Leave. Everything he has e ver done in his le has been largely about himself, his profile, his career. And that same narcissism is reflected in his personal le where, as his famous shouting match with his current girlfriend Carrie Symonds appeared to show, it all has to be on his terms and to hell with the consequences for others.  Fair play to him on one level – everything he set out to do he has done it. Got all the positions he sought at Eton and Oxford. Made a name for himself as a journalist not least in Brussels by making up stories and, to the Daily ’s shame, getting away with it. Edited a magazine. Won a seat in Parliament. Won two terms as Mayor of London, historically a Labour city. Made history in leading the winning side in the referendum. Became Foreign Secretary. And now, the job he always saw as his destiny, sitting in Churchill’s chair.  But now he is there, his mettle will be tested as never before. He will have a large number of right-wing press sycophants who will help cover up his failings and exaggerate his successes.

More than half of Theresa Mayaposs cabinet -  out of  - were either sacked or resigned in the new PMaposs brutal reshuffle last night. Both Remainers and supporters of leadership rival Jeremy Hunt were shown the door as Johnson ruthlessly dumped enemies - including Mr Hunt himself who quit after refusing a demotion to Defence Secretary. Right-wing Tories Sajid Javid, Priti Patel and Dominic Raab were ushered in as Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary respectively. Health Secretary Matt Hancock and DWP chief Amber Rudd kept their jobs after swallowing their pride - and principles - to offer some support for Mr Johnson. Hated Esther McVey becomes Housing Minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg leads the Commons and disgraced former Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson ed as Education Secretary despite having to resign over a national security leak .    Itaposs thought to be the biggest clearout of Government ministers in political history - one that takes us back to the ideology of Margaret Thatcher, rewards hard Leavers and tilts towards a No Deal Brexit or a forced general election. It shocked Westminster with its speed and viciousness, rewarding loyalists and ejecting ministers who were key to Mrs May’s regime, and those he feared might torpedo his plan to tear Britain out of the EU without a deal on October . Itaposs also so big that the sacked ministers are in line for more than £, in severance pay between them. So whoaposs backed for promotion, whoaposs sacked by the boss, and whoaposs cracked under the pressure in Boris Johnsonaposs new-look team  Weaposve had a look at them all - and their more chequered records. This piece is being updated throughout the Cabinet reshuffle. BACKED: The new Cabinet in full  Prime Minister: Boris Johnson Chancellor: Sajid Javid Home Secretary: Priti Patel Foreign Secretary: Dominic Raab Defence Secretary: Ben Wallace Cabinet Office Minister: Michael Gove Trade Secretary: Liz Truss Chief Secretary to the Treasury: Rishi Sunak Health Secretary: Matt Hancock Work and Pensions Secretary: Amber Rudd Environment Secretary: Theresa Villiers Brexit Secretary: Stephen Barclay Education Secretary: Gavin Williamson Culture Secretary: Nicky Morgan Business Secretary: Andrea Leadsom Communities Secretary: Robert Jenrick Justice Secretary: Robert Buckland Scottish Secretary: Alister Jack Transport Secretary: Grant Shapps International Development Secretary: Alok Sharma Northern Ireland Secretary: Julian Smith Wales Secretary: Alun Cairns Attorney General: Geoffrey Cox Chief Whip: Mark Spencer Conservative Party Chairman: James Cleverly Leader of the House of Commons: Jacob Rees-Mogg Leader of the House of Lords: Baroness Evans Universities Minister: Jo Johnson Housing Minister: Esther McVey Immigration Minister: Brandon Lewis Paymaster General: Oliver Dowden Business Minister: Kwasi Kwarteng Northern Powerhouse Minister: Jake Berry SACKED  CRACKED: All  Tories sacked or resigned  Theresa May- the th David LidingtonPhilip HammondJeremy HuntPenny MordauntDavid GaukeGreg ClarkLiam FoxDamian HindsJames BrokenshireChris GraylingDavid MundellKaren BradleyRory StewartJeremy WrightMel StrideJulian SmithCaroline NokesPORTRAITS OF THE INS AND OUTS BACKED: New hires to Cabinet Chief Whip: Mark Spencer VOTED REMAIN  The MP for Sherwood since  will be the PMaposs own Sherf of Nottingham, trying to win over Tory MPs in Brexit votes despite a working majority of just one or two. Itaposs an about-turn for Mr Spencer - who voted Remain in the  referendum. The state-educated politician studied at Shuttleworth Agricultural College in Bedfordshire and joined his familyaposs farming and farm shop business. He joined Parliament in  where he was a backbencher for six years. His big break was in the Tory whipsapos office, which he joined in June . He prompted fury in  by suggesting a dying benefit claimant, sanctioned after he turned up four minutes late, should learn the discipline of timekeeping. Labour MP Lisa Nandy said the man hadn’t eaten for  days and looked like he was dying but Mr Sherwood cut in: It is important that those who are seeking employment learn the discipline of timekeeping. Separately, Mr Spencer - who receives at least £, in rent per year from a farm - was one of  Tory landlords who voted against a Commons bid to force all homes to be fit for human habitation in .    Home Secretary: Priti Patel VOTED LEAVE  Shamed Tory ex minister Priti Patel will be handed a plum job in Boris Johnsonaposs top team - with some tipping her as a possible Home Secretary. Theresa May sacked Ms Patel as International Development Secretary in  after she had aposoff-the-booksapos meetings with senior Israeli officials during a aposfamily holidayapos. But Mr Johnson was expected to trumpet herto the Cabinet as part of a record number of ethnic minority politicians in the team. The -year-old MP for Witham, Essex, is a hard-right Tory who backs tax cuts and supported the death penalty until . Sheaposs also a Brexiteer aposultraapos who voted against Theresa Mayaposs deal all three times in Parliament. She was slammed in December for suggesting the government could use possible Brexit food shortages as leverage. A government report said No Deal could prompt food shortages in Ireland - infamously crippled by the th Century potato famine. But Ms Patel told The Times: Why hasnapost this point been pressed home during negotiations  The grammar school-educated Tory apparatchik was born in London to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the s and studied at Essex and Keele Universities. She worked for the Tories and Sir James Goldsmithaposs Referendum Party in the s before ing as William Hagueaposs deputy press secretary from  to  - eventually becoming an MP in . Civil liberties campaigners will be concerned about Ms Patelaposs appointment as Home Secretary. For many years she argued for theof capital punishment - though she says her mind has changed on the subject in recent years.    Foreign Secretary: Dominic Raab VOTED LEAVE  Dominic Raab is a hard Brexit backing, tax slashing right-wing ideologue who famously only learned how important the Dover-Calais trade route was for Britain after becoming Brexit Secretary. After crashing out of the race to succeed Theresa May, Mr Raab backed Boris Johnson and has been rewarded for his loyalty with one of the great offices of state. An ex-Foreign Office lawyer,  he left the civil service to become chief of staff to another former Brexit Secretary David Davis. He was elected MP for Esher and Walton in  and joined the government in , quickly rising through the ranks. Mr Raab in his short spell as Brexit Secretary admitted that he hadnapost fully read the Good Friday Agreement. In  Mr Raab said feminists are now amongst the most obnoxious bigots and said it was time for men to start burning their briefs. In  he said most food bank users were not languishing in poverty but were instead had cash flow problems and has branded Brits the worst idlers in the world. He will also be First Minister of State, which effectively makes him Deputy Prime Minister. Education Secretary: Gavin Williamson VOTED REMAIN  Gavin Williamson was sacked as Defence Secretary over leaks from the National Security Council. That was  days ago. Heaposs now ing to frontline politics as Secretary of State for Education. Itaposs unclear whether this also signals ato government for Cronus the tarantula. Business Secretary: Andrea Leadsom VOTED LEAVE  Andrea Leadsom resigned from Theresa Mayaposs cabinet a little over two months ago in protest against her Brexit Strategy. She stood in the election to replace Mrs May, but was eliminated in the first round of voting. She placed eighth out of  candidates, attracting just  votes from her fellow Tory MPs. Culture Secretary: Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: Theresa Villiers VOTED LEAVE  Theresa Villiers will replace Michael Gove as Environment Secretary. It marks ato Cabinet for the former Northern Ireland Secretary, who served for four years from . Villiers was one of the six Cabinet ministers who came out in support of Brexit during the EU referendum. Following the referendum, on  July , Villiers resigned from her position as Northern Ireland Secretary after saying that Theresa May had offered her a post outside the Cabinet which was not one which I felt I could take on. But despite solid Brexit credentials in the eyes of Team Boris, Villiers may not survive the next election, she has a majority of just  votes in her seat of Chipping Barnet. Culture Secretary: Nicky Morgan VOTED REMAIN  The former Education Secretary was once part of the Tories’ pro-EU wing that proved awkward for May. But her acceptance of the result, and her support for Johnson during the leadership contest, meant ato Cabinet was likely. MP for the marginal seat of Loughborough, she impressed at Education after being drafted in to repair the damage to relations with teachers inflicted by Michael Gove. At Culture, her job will be to revive the ministry which some believe has suffered under the lacklustre leadership of Jeremy Wright. The job is known in Westminster as “Minister for Fun” because perks include free tickets to major sporting events, film and music award ceremonies, and nights at the opera or pop concerts. Morgan will certainly bring more spark to the role than Wright, but she will have had to convince Johnson she will fully back his fallback plan for a no-deal Brexit. International Development Secretary: Alok Sharma VOTED REMAIN  The MP for Reading West was expected to reach the Cabinet table for the first time after spending three years as a junior minister. The married dad-of-two, , attended the private Reading Blue Coat school and the University of Salford before qualying as a Deloitte chartered accountant. He spent  years in banking including investment banking before joining Parliament in . He was made a Foreign Office minister in  followed by the Communities Department and Department for Work and Pensions. Last year he faced shouts of apospathetic!apos as he tried to deny Universal Credit was forcing people to food banks - something his boss Amber Rudd later admitted. He also admitted the DWP dropped the ball when a scathing internal report on the benefit was published almost  months late. He voted Remain in the  EU referendum. Transport Secretary: Grant Shapps VOTED LEAVE BUT HAS SINCE CHANGED HIS MIND  An unexpectedto the Cabinet for Grant Shapps, who has been out of the top team since . He was demoted by David Cameron from his job as party co-chairman and Minister without Portfolio after revelations about his second job and use of the assumed names Michael Green and Sebastian Fox. His demotion came after he admitted to having over-firmly denied having had a second job while he was an MP. Scotland Secretary: Alister Jack VOTED LEAVE Alister Jackaposs appointment was met with a resounding who in the corridors of Westminster. And with good reason. Heaposs only been an MP since . In just two years, heaposs managed to have had a role on the Treasury Select Committee, be appointed an aide to Andrea Leadsom and be made an Assistant Government Whip. And now heaposs in the Cabinet. Chief Secretary to the Treasury: Rishi Sunak VOTED LEAVE  Local Government Minister Mr Sunak is considered a rising star of the Conservative Party. He is seen as a capable media performer and a confident politician with detail. An early backer of Boris Johnson, Mr Sunak was wheeled out by his campaign to defuse accusations that their candidate was a racist. In the Brexit referendum, Mr Sunak backed leaving the European Union. A former entrepreneur he worked in Calornia as an investor before in  winning the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Richmond in Yorkshire, after former leader William Hague stood down. Mr Sunak is married to Akshata Murthy, daughter of Indian businessman and billionaire N. R. Narayana Murthy. Housing minister: Esther McVey VOTED LEAVE  Itaposs a demotion from her previous job as Work and Pensions Secretary, but welfare slasher Esther McVey has been brought back into the cabinet as a Housing Minister. Universities Minister: Jo Johnson VOTED REMAIN  Boris Johnson has given his brother Jo his old job back. Johnson Jr was minister for Universities and Science from , until Theresa May moved him to transport in . He quit as a minister in November so he could back a second Brexit referendum. It will be interesting to see what he doesit looks like weaposre heading for no-deal. Paymaster General: Oliver Dowden VOTED REMAIN A paid-up member of the political establishment, Mr Dowden rose through the ranks of Conservative wonkery before ending up in No as an adviser to David Cameron, and promoted to deputy chief of staff.  He once joked to an American interviewer that his job as a special advisor was day-to-day crisis management and he is seen by Tory insiders as a safe pair of hands. In  Mr Dowden, who is called aposOliveapos by friends, was elected to the safe tory seat of Hertsmere in Hertfordshire in . He was also given a goodbye gong by departing PM and former Boss David Cameron becoming a  Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Mr Dowden backed Remain in the  referendum but has not joined the group of awkward Tory MPs opposing Brexit. But as a close ally of the Cameron project, his promotion will be a potential red flag to the Tory traditionalists and eurosceptic hardliners who have pushed Mr Johnson to power. BACKED: Promoted from within Chancellor of the Exchequer: Sajid Javid VOTED REMAIN A reluctant remainer in the referendum, Sajid Javid is a born-again Brexiteer and has been promoted to the second-highest job in government. Mr Javid ran for the leadership himself before swinging behind Mr Johnson in his race to be Prime Minister. Multi-millionaire banker Sajid Javid was the first Home Secretary from an ethnic minority. The son of a bus driver, he was elected MP for Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in  and was quickly identied a a rising star. The former City banker sat on the work and Pensions Select Committee, then the powerful Public Accounts Committee. Mr Javid, who comes from a Muslim background but does not practise any religion, was particularly close to Chancellor George Osborne and was appointed a Treasury Minister in September . He was elevated to the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in April of that year and became Business Secretary in May  after the Toriesapos shock election outright victory. He had a picture of Margaret Thatcher hanging on his wall at University. Defence Secretary: Ben Wallace VOTED REMAIN  Ben Wallace gets a promotion from Security Minister to the top job at the Ministry of Defence. Heaposs a married father of three and has been MP for Wyre and Preston North since May . According to his website, his first job after leaving school at  was as a ski instructor in Austria. He went on to enter Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Scots Guards aged . Heaposs also worked in the Aerospace industry. In his spare time, he enjoys rugby, skiing and horse racing. Cabinet Office minister: Michael Gove VOTED LEAVE  Johnsonaposs former leadership rival - and the man who infamously torpedoed his last run at being Prime Minister - is back in the fold. Heaposll be Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Cabinet Office minister. But unlike his predecessor David Lidington, he wonapost be de facto Deputy PM. That job goes to Dominic Raab. Itaposll be a welcome change of pace for the former journalist, who has spent the last few years at DEFRA banning things. International Trade Secretary: Liz Truss VOTED REMAIN Liz Truss has been moved to replace Liam Fox at the Department of International Trade. Sheaposs previously served as Environment Secretary, Justice Secretary and most recently Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Considering her passion for opening new pork markets and for ensuring the success of British cheese, sheaposll fit right in at DIT. Communities Secretary: Robert Jenrick  Promoted from a junior Treasury role, Jenrick becomes the youngest member of Johnson Cabinet and one of the youngest in any Cabinet in recent years. He was elected to Parliament in a  by-election in Newark, Notts, triggered by the resignation of Patrick Mercer. Jenrick edited his student newspaper at Cambridge, and went on to become a solicitor, advising businesses and financial institutions on corporate law in London and Moscow, before quitting the profession and moving into business, before switching again, this time into politics. He has three young daughters with we Michal. Justice Secretary: Robert Buckland VOTED REMAIN  Robert Buckland has been promoted from Prisons Minister to Johnsonaposs top man in the Ministry of Justice. Buckland is a qualied Barrister and one of the few Remainers left in the cabinet after todayaposs cull. He previously served as Solicitor General from -. Northern Ireland Secretary: Julian Smith VOTED REMAIN  Theresa Mayaposs Chief Whip has been sent to possibly the least desirable job in the British Government. Heaposll be in charge of restoring power sharing to Northern Ireland. And then thereaposs the thorny question of finding a way to make the border work with neither a backstop or customs checkpoints. Minister without Portfolio and Conservative Party Chairman: James Cleverly VOTED LEAVE  Former Army reservist James Cleverly gets bumped up from junior Brexit minister to Party chairman. Prior to Theresa Mayaposs last reshuffle, he was a deputy Party chair. After briefly standing in the leadership election, he shelved his own ambitions and became a loyal backer of Johnson through the rest of the campaign. Home Office Minister: Brandon Lewis VOTED LEAVE  Brandon Lewis gets a ministerial role after  months as Tory Chairman. His tenure as Party chief started out fairly badly. He faced calls for his resignation after it emerged security holes in the Tory Conference app had exposed the private mobile phone numbers of several senior minister to the internet. But it ended on a more positive note, having overseen a broadly successful leadership campaign.  In the most eye-popping move of the day, Johnsonaposs former leadership rival will be leaving Government entirely. Johnson sacked him as Foreign Secretary and he turned down another job. He tweeted: I would have been honoured to carry on my work at the Foreign Office but understand the need for a new Prime Minister to choose his team. Boris Johnson kindly offered me another role but after nine years in Cabinet  over  cabinet meetings now is the time toto the backbenches from where PM will have my full support. Iaposve been a cabinet minister for every hour my three gorgeous children have been alive. So whilst it may seem strange for someone who just tried to become PMI have decided now is the time for the biggest challenge of all - to be a GOOD DAD! It has been a huge honour to be responsible for the finest diplomatic service in the world  to see the courage  wisdom of our diplomats  intelligence services. Thanks for guiding me with such patience  professionalism! Proud to have stood up alongside you for British values. Also most importantly heartfelt thanks to the   of Conservative Party members who supported me. Despite being the outsider, the #HastobeHunt campaign was spirited  smart . I was truly humbled with the confidence placed in me by so many people. Defence Secretary and Women and Equalities Minister: Penny Mordaunt Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who was made the first woman to hold the office after Gavin Williamson was sacked by Theresa May, has announced she will be ing to the backbenches. She said on Twitter: I’m heading to the backbenches from where the PM will have my full support, as will my successors at DefenceHQ  WomenEqualities. Thank you to everyone who’s helped me get things done, especially our Armed Forces and civilians in defence for the last  days. We achieved much. Itaposs currently unclearshe resigned or was sacked. International Trade Secretary: Liam Fox Liam Fox announced he would not be ing to Government, but he too failed to say whether it was by his choice or Johnsonaposs. He tweeted: Sadly, I will be leaving the Government. It has been a privilege to have served as Secretary of State for International Trade these past  years. I am proud to have worked with a tremendously talented team @tradegovuk to boost trade  investment and prepare for Brexit. The world-class trade department we have built leaves the UK uniquely well-positioned to forge our new trading relationships beyond Europe and create a truly Global Britain. But we must first undertake the momentous task of delivering on the instruction of the British people and leave the European Union. I look forward to supporting @BorisJohnson and the government from the backbenches. Business Secretary: Greg Clark Greg Clark more or less said he had been sacked in a statement issued on Twitter. He wrote: I warmly congratulate Boris Johnson on becoming Prime Minister. He is right to appoint a new team for a new premiership and I wish him and them well for the vital work ahead. It has been an honour to serve the country as Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for the last  years and as Communities Secretary, Universities amp Science Minister, Cities Minister, Financial Secretary to the Treasury  Planning Minister. I am grateful for the support of outstanding civil servants, special advisors and ministerial colleagues during that time. I look forward to participating fully in the work of Parliament and continuing to serve the people of Tunbridge Wells. Education Secretary: Damian Hinds Education Secretary Damian Hinds has also departed from Boris Johnsonaposs cabinet. He said: It has been the greatest privilege to serve as Education Secretary. Thank you to the brilliant team at @educationgovuk. And thank you to everyone working in education and childrenaposs care, for all you do. I look forward to supporting the government from the backbenches. Communities Secretary: James Brokenshire Despite backing Johnson in the leadership contest, James Brokenshire is out of the Cabinet. His last act in office was to reinstate sacked aposphilosopherapos Roger Scruton to his government advisory role. Northern Ireland Secretary: Karen Bradley  Karen Bradley is reportedly out as Northern Ireland Secretary. Sheaposll perhaps be best remembered for admitting in public that she was profoundly ignorant of Northern Irelandaposs political isions. In an interview with the House Magazine, she said: I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn’t understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland. Scotland Secretary: David Mundell Mundell says he was disappointed, but not surprised to be leaving the Scotland office. Thataposs him sacked then. He tweeted: Disappointed but not surprised to be leaving the Scotland Office after  years. Will, of course, support the new Government, but as I said to PM this afternoon I will also hold him to account on his commitments to the Union. Hope there’s still room on the backbenches! Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary: Jeremy Wright  Mr Wright, who never really seemed comfortable at the ministry of fun, is reportedly gone. Of course, weaposll never know for sure, because the ex-Digital minister is still not on Twitter. Immigration Minister : Caroline Nokes Ms Nokes was reportedly sacked as Immigration Minister. Her tweet announcing the news of her departure contains some brutal shade: My successor as Immigration Minister undoubtedly has a massive challenge ahead. Leader of the House of Commons: Mel Stride Mel Stride was Leader of the House for  days. Barely enough time to get comfortable before heading back to the Backbenches. He wrote: Huge honour to have served as Lord President and Leader of the House. Looking forward to continuing to support my constituents and our PM from backbenches. Huge thanks to all who supported me so brilliantly during my  yrs in govt - in the whips office, HMT and in Leader’s Office NO CHANGE Health Secretary: Matt Hancock VOTED REMAIN The only Health Secretary ever to have his own app is staying in charge of the NHS. The tech-obsessed MP, who once launched his own app, pulled out of the contest to replace Theresa May after he came sixth in the first round of MPs votes. The geeky son of software developers voted Remain in the Brexit referendum but has since backed Brexit. His achievements in government have been limited, with him finally settling the pay dispute with NHS staff negotiated by Jeremy Hunt his only real achievement. But in one of Westminsteraposs most precarious Cabinet jobs sometimes no news can be seen as good news. At just -years-old the former economist, who worked for both George Osborne and the Bank of England, is seen by more moderate Tories as a potential future leader. If he can survive unscathed, and untainted, by Boris Johnsonaposs government. Brexit Secretary: Stephen Barclay VOTED LEAVE Stephen Barclay has been rewarded for failing to secure a Brexit deal that MPs could back under Theresa May by being allowed to keep his job as Brexit Secretary. Stephen Barclay was appointed by Theresa May after both previous holders of the job - David Davis and Dominic Raab - quit over her plans for Brexit . Barclay - who calls himself Steve - is the -year-old MP for North East Cambridgeshire. The former Axa insurance lawyer and dad-of-two was born in , the son of a union official and civil servant, and grew up with three brothers who all played rugby. Work and Pensions Secretary: Amber Rudd VOTED REMAIN Amber Rudd has been rewarded for her latter-day conversion to accepting no-deal Brexit as an option by being allowed to keep her job. Sheaposs also been made Women and Equalities Minister, which was previously part of departing Defence Secretary Penny Mordauntaposs job. After backing the Remain campaign at the referendum, she said last week: The situation is that we are leaving at the end of October but it would be so much better to get a deal. What we really need is for everybody’s effort to go into trying to get a deal. Wales Secretary: Alun Cairns Alun Cairns has been Secretary of State for Wales since March , and Boris Johnson doesnapost see why he should stop now. He has run the London Marathon seven times. His personal best is h m s, making him the seventh fastest MP ever. CRACKED: Resigned from Cabinet Deputy PM: David Lidington  Theresa Mayaposs deputy David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, announced he was stepping down - and suggested heaposll now fight No Deal. The ardently pro-EU MP said he was relishing the chance to campaign freely on issues close to his heart. He wrote: After  yrs on the front bench itaposs the right moment to move on. I shall leave the govt when Theresa May offers her resignation to The Queen. I shall do all I can to help new govt secure a deal to allow an orderly departure from the EU. After more than two decades of collective responsibility Iaposm now relishing the prospect of speaking  campaigning freely for the things that matter to me  to my constituents. Chancellor: Philip Hammond  Philip Hammond confirmed he was getting ready to quit ahead of Boris Johnson taking over as PM. The Chancellor is vehemently opposed to crashing out of the UK without a deal. He said he wouldnapost wait to be sacked by Boris Johnson but rather planned to resign after Theresa Mayaposs last PMQs in place on Wednesday. In his resignation letterhe said: I believe that your successor must be free to choose a Chancellor who is fully aligned with his policy position.  Justice Secretary David Gauke served in Theresa Mayaposs Cabinet since she took office in June . He was so famed for his cool manner that he used to get uncorked by more senior Tories to face dficult questions. But he said he would not be able to serve under Boris Johnson. Given that Iaposve been in the Cabinet since Theresa May came to power, I think the appropriate thing is for me to resign to her, he said. Heaposs now tipped to form a Gaukeward Squad on the backbenches fighting against a No Deal Brexit . International Development Secretary: Rory Stewart The International Development Secretary announced during his brief run for the party leadership that he would not serve in a Boris Johnson government. He said on Twitter : Because of our dferences on Brexit and prorogation, I wouldn’t be able to serve in a Boris Johnson cabinet. And he confirmed it with a tweet congratulating Johnson on his victory, and saying he would be on the backbench tomorrow serving Cumbria. The tweet was accompanied by a picture of Stewart with two horses. Transport Secretary: Chris Grayling  Chris Grayling was paradoxically both one of the worst ministers ever and also one of the longest serving ministers of recent years. Itaposs now been confirmed he willto the backbenches. A source close to Chris Grayling has said he was not sacked, despite a litany of failures littering his career. They said: Chris packed up and said goodbye to his private office this morning. He’d told Boris he didn’t want to continue when he backed him.JUNIOR MINISTERS: Changes below Cabinet level ResignedAlan DuncanAnne MiltonBACKROOM TEAM: Bestof the rest IN: Dominic Cummings  Boris Johnson has hired the infamous former boss of the Vote Leave campaign to work as a senior advisor to him in government. MPs voiced their fury as Dominic Cummings ed to the top tier of British politics, just months after being found in contempt of Parliament. Mr Cummings is an abrasive former special advisor to Michael Gove who took on the blob of the teaching profession. He was then one of the architects of the official Vote Leave campaign, serving as its campaign director, during the EU referendum in . His famously bullish style was portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in a TV drama on the infighting that plagued the Leave camp. He is said to have been a mastermind behind Vote Leaveaposs most controversial messages, including the bus that ly claimed we send £million a week to the EU and messages misleadingly claiming Turkey was joining the EU. He branded Tory Brexiteers in the ERG useful idiots, called top Tory David Davis thick as mince, claimed some Tory Brexiteers spent the referendum chasing girls and other Brexiteer economists were charlatans. IN: Andrew Grfiths Itaposs also emerged Johnson plans to make multi-millionaire Andrew Grfiths an advisor. Grfiths hit headlines last month after it emerged he had loaned Johnson his £.m Westminster townhouse to use as a campaign HQ. Labour ’s Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office Jon Trickett MP said: Before he is even appointed Prime Minister, one of Boris Johnsonaposs first acts is to dish out a powerful job in Number  to his super-rich pal who lent him his luxurious house in Westminster for the Tory leadership campaign. “The public would be forgiven for coming to the conclusion that Johnson’s friends can buy influence within the new administration. Itaposs blindingly obvious – Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite. OUT: Sir Mick Davis  Tory Party Treasurer and chief executive Sir Mick Davis said he was on the way out. It comes after the millionaire was forced to dig deep into his own pockets to keep the party funded under Theresa May. He said: I think that our new leader, Boris Johnson, should be free to choose a team at CCHQ who can work together to ensure that this organisation realises its central purpose – a clear and decisive victory at the next General Election.

Esther McVey is back in government for the third time - as the Toriesapos ninth Housing Minister in nine years. Itaposs a job of grave seriousness, responsible for the re-cladding of hundreds of unsafe tower blocks in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire. So campaigners may be unnerved by the appointment of bullish Ms McVey - a true-blue Tory whoaposs not exactly known for subtlety - to the sensitive role. In her years as a Work and Pensions Minister she made a string of comments that angered benefit claimants and had to apologise for using misleading statistics. And as a Tory leadership contendershe vowed to strip back foreign aid payments to spend more on schools and police. So who is the former GMTV presenter and what has she said     She was ousted from her Wirral West seat in  after a sustained campaign against her, but ed in George Osborneaposs ultra-safe Tatton seat in . Ms McVey served as a minister in the Department for Work of Pensions for three years in the welfare-slashing days of Iain Duncan Smith, followed by her role as Work and Pensions Secretary - which she quit to protest against Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal. Hereaposs a short guide. . She said the rise of food banks was apospositiveapos  Ms McVey told the House of Commons in December : In the UK it is right that, you know, more people are visiting - which youaposd expect - going to foodbanks. As time is tough, we are all having to pay back this £. trillion debt personally which spiralled under Labour. To furious heckles she added: The community has come together to support one another - that must be a positive move. Ms McVey blamed the rise in food banks on Labour refusing to let Jobcentres signpost people to them before . And she compared Britainaposs , food bank users to .million in Germany to point out the number was relatively low. Embarrassingly for her, since her speech the number of parcels handed out by the Trussell Trust foodbank charity in the UK has soared to .million. Labour MP Luciana Berger said Ms McVeyaposs response still haunted her, telling the Liverpool Echo: It was disgraceful and showed absolutely no empathy - I was on the benches going ballistic.  Ms McVey was a key defender of the Bedroom Tax, launched by the Tories in April , which increases the rent people have to paythey have extra rooms. Critics point out thereaposs a shortage of smaller flats for people to aposdownsizeapos to - so they were left stuck paying higher rates. Several aspects of the charge have been defeated in the courts. But Ms McVey vehemently defended the measure - and claimed people who stayed put would be more than happy. She said Labour were hypocritical because they applied a penalty to housing benefit in the private rented sector in . She said this justied its huge extension, under the Tories, to social housing as well. In  highlight%spare+room+subsidy%#contribution-\" rel\"nofollow\"one  debate she said: We could not afford it [the aposextraapos cash to spare rooms]. Labour had already introduced the measure. We have to consider the  million people on the housing waiting list and the , people in overcrowded accommodation. We have to ask how we will support the taxpayers paying for it, who might not have spare bedrooms themselves, as well as the people on waiting lists and the people in overcrowded accommodation. . She apologised for misleading MPs about Universal Credit  In July  Ms McVey faced calls to quit as she apologised for misleading MPs over her flagship benefits shake-up. The row erupted after Ms McVey disowned a report by the National Audit Office that warned Universal Credit was poor value for money and forcing people to food banks. Ms McVey claimed the damning report was out of date. But in an unprecedented open letter, respected NAO chief Sir Amyas Morse said there was “no evidence” of this. He also accused the Cabinet minister of contradicting her own officials, who had “fully agreed” to the report, and misrepresenting its findings. He then branded her behaviour “odd” and said her key claim that Universal Credit is working “has not been proven”. Ms McVey faced shouts of “resign” as she apologised to parliament - for only one of three “unproven” statements highlighted by the NAO. She told MPs: “I mistakenly said the NAO had asked for the rollout of Universal Credit to continue at a faster rate and be speeded up. “In fact the NAO did not say that and I want to apologise to [the Speaker] and the House for inadvertently misleading you.” Labour demanded a probe into whether the Work and Pensions Secretary broke the Ministerial Code. . She suggested Tory benefit cuts were aposfake newsapos  At the  Tory conference, Ms McVey suggested her own partyaposs benefit cuts are fake news. The Work and Pensions Secretary launched an arrogant attack on Labour and social media - despite cuts being well-documented by think tanks and her predecessor Iain Duncan Smith. Most working-age benefits are frozen for four years from   to   - a cut to familiesapos real income. The governmentaposs own  Budget said this would cut £billion a year from the benefits bill. Yet Ms McVey appeared to suggest all these facts were fake news because the total amount of money put into thebenefits system has gone up. She told Tory members in Birmingham: If you were to believe everything you heard from Labour or read on social media youaposd think we were somehow letting down the most vulnerable in society - especially disabled people. However, those who say we are cutting budgets are peddling fake news. So here’s the real news - we have never spent more on those with disabilities and long-term health conditions. We spend over £billion a year, up £billion on . . She said benefit sanctions aposhelpapos people find work and compared claimants to school children  Defending the sanctions system, accused of stopping peopleaposs benefits for months for minor mistakes, she told a Commons committee in : What does a teacher do in a school  A teacher would tell you off, or give you lines and detentions, or whatever it is, but at the same time they have your best interest at heart. They are teaching you, they are educating you, but at the same time they will also have the ability to sanction you. Standing by the policy, she told another committee hearing in : For people who have been sanctioned, that helps them get into work. . She said there was aposno robust evidenceapos that linked soaring food bank use to welfare cuts  Ms McVey prompted a backlash in  by claiming there was no robust evidence linking food bank use to Tory welfare cuts. In the letter to the Scottish government, seen by the BBC, she added: The rise in food banks predates most of the welfare reforms this government has put in place. The claim was branded heartless by the SNP , and the Trussell Trust, Britainaposs largest food bank charity, said at the time: All the empirical evidence and research shows that welfare reform is the main force driving increasing demand for food banks. Latest surveys by the Trussell Trust show clients gave benefit delays and benefit changes as two of the three most likely reasons for using food banksand %. Low income was the most likely on %. Successor as DWP chief Amber Rudd later admitted there was a link between the early rollout of Universal Credit and food banks. . She billed taxpayers £, for a professional photographer  Vain Esther McVey billed taxpayers at least £, in expenses for a professional photographer. The Tory leadership hopeful was slammed as absurd after the spending was revealed by a newspaper investigation. Official records confirm she spent thousands of pounds in the last  months on Jonathan Farber. The former Tory councilloraposs website describes him as a PR and press photographer while his LinkedIn page boasts he runs visual communications for Ms McVey. One £ invoice released under freedom of information laws showed he did five hours’ work for two shoots including “edits, image processing and travel time”.

Itaposs the plummy-voiced Old Etonian big moment - the pinnacle of years of campaigning for a hard Brexit from the backbenches. Not to mention an obsession with Parliamentary procedure. Through the years heaposs raised his profile - carefully crafted with double-breasted suits, snaps of his six kids and and LBC show - by being an old-fashioned English eccentric. Exquisitely polite, but sometimes saying the most damning things. But behind the th Century veneer are also some th Century views that, now heaposs attending Cabinet each week as a senior minister, will have new prominence. So who is Jacob Rees-Mogg - and more importantly, what are his views on issues that arenapost all about Brexit  Hereaposs a quick reminder.  Parliamentary history geek Mr Rees-Mogg, who even wears a double-breasted suit in family snaps, is the son of a former Times newspaper editor and amassed a vast fortune through his City firm Somerset Capital Management. He has six eccentrically-named children with his aristocrat we Helena, whose ancestors include Charles I advisor Thomas Wentworth and former Prime Minister Charles Watson-Wentworth. A painting of his horse hangs in the National Gallery. Her family inherited the sumptuous stately home Wentworth Woodhouse, which was given a £.million repair grant by the Tory government last year despite soaring homelessness. Mr Rees-Moggaposs quirky mannerisms have given him a cult status among Tory activists with one, Ross Atkinson, getting a tattoo of the word aposMoggmentumapos on his chest. The Mirror later revealed Facebook rants in which Mr Atkinson complained sex assaults were a cultural norm for refugees.  He sparked fury last year by claiming the huge rise of food banks is uplting. The free marketeer insisted the state canapost do everything adding: I think there is a need for some private charity on top of what the state provides. The MP told LBC radio: I donapost think the state can do everything that it tries. It provides a base of welfare that should allow people to make ends meet during the course of the week but on some occasions that will not work. And to have charitable support given by people voluntarily to support their fellow citizens I think is rather uplting and shows what a good compassionate country we are. There are two Trussell Trust food banks alone in the MPaposs North East Somerset constituency, while he lives in a Grade II-listed manor house with Helena, the children and a nanny.  Committed Catholic Mr Rees-Mogg said last year he is opposed to abortion, even for women who have been raped. The traditionalist backbencher said he was “completely opposed” to abortion, adding: “Le begins at the point of conception.” Askedhis opposition was so absolute it included cases of rape and incest, he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I’m afraid so. Le is sacrosanct. It begins at the point of conception, and I think it is wrong.” Labouraposs Yvette Cooper said the idea that the Conservative Party would consider someone with Mr Rees-Moggaposs views as a potential leader was an appalling thought. She added: Eveybody’s entitled to their own personal views and their own personal views and their own conscience views about an issue like abortion, but for somebody who the Conservative Party seem to be suggesting could be the next Prime Minister to want to control women’s bodies in this way, even in cases like rape and incest, I personally find quite shocking.  Speaking at a fringe event at Conservative Party Conference, he said: “I loathe this idea that we’ve got to give baubles to young people. I think it is so desperately condescending. Young people are not some alien species that we have to treat dferently from other voters.” Of Labour he added: “Of course they want to give everyone free tuition. because they’re socialists. They like spending other people’s money. That’s what socialists do.”  In a  article he said zero-hour contracts were an excellent way for students to find work in the university holiday. People find these contracts could be an important stepping stone from unemployment and welfare dependency to employment, he declared. They benefit business, consumers and taxpayers by keeping costs down. And he claimed Labouraposs campaign against the exploitative measures was the standard response of the left to market forces. And he opposes gay marriage  Last year Mr Rees-Mogg said he supported the teachings of the Catholic church, which opposes same sex marriage, because marriage is a “sacrament.” He added: “The teaching of the Catholic church is completely clear. The marriage issue is the important thing. This is not how people arrange their lives. It’s that marriage is a sacrament, and a sacrament is under the authority of the church, not of the state.

Once a new leader has been selected by either a General Election or a party vote, the Queen has the job of officially asking themthey will form a Governmen t. Sheaposs worked with some real characters over the years, including Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and John Major. The Queen isnapost allowed to share her political views and never speaks about her relationships with the leaders, but there have been a few interesting reports. The Royal Familyaposs official website says the Monarch always has a aposspecial relationshipapos with whoever is leading her Government - so weaposve had a look back at some of the more interesting ones...   Margaret Thatcher The Queen and Mrs Thatcher apparently didnapost really get on.    In fact, a Buckingham Palace source told a diplomat the monarch actually considered scrapping their weekly meetings all together. Declassied files revealed in  claimed the Tory PM enraged the Queen by defying Commonwealth leaders in a vote over apartheid . Files from the National Archives of Ireland show that Thatcher sparked international anger after refusing to back tighter sanctions against South Africa. The move had been agreed by  leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Vancouver, Canada, but Mrs Thatcher refused, thwarting efforts to end apartheid and enraging heads of state.    An Irish diplomat based in London reported back to Dublin that it was widely regarded that the PM had “blundered badly” and “she well knows but cannot admit her mistake”. After speaking with a source at Buckingham Palace, he sent a confidential message to the Taoiseach’s office. The diplomat wrote: “There is a wide view too that the Queen is in a rage with Mrs Thatcher over her handling of the sanctions .” Using the nickname Brenda, which was given to the Queen by satirical magazine Private Eye, the diplomat continued: “A source in the palace said that ‘Brenda’ was seriously considering cancelling last night’s Tuesday audience with the prime minister. This audience... has existed for more than a century.” Winston Churchill Churchill was the first PM the Queen worked with after her fatheraposs early and tragic death. They were reportedly very close, and he was said to be a formidable presence for the young monarch, who was just  at the time. Nicholas Soames, Churchillaposs grandson, said: I think the Queen valued my grandfatheraposs experience, and he of course loved the Queen. He did love her.    I mean, she aroused in him all his romantic ideas of sovereignty and monarchy. Royal historian Robert Lacey added: I think there’s a sense in which all the Queen’s Prime Ministers have been in love with her to a certain degree. But it was most overtly displayed by Churchill. He made no pretence at it, there were tears in his eyes when he welcomed her. The Queen send Churchill a handwritten letter after he retired in  saying how much she missed him She  wrote that no other PM would would ever for me be able to hold the place of my first prime minister, to whom both my husband and I owe so much and for whose wise guidance during the early years of my reign I shall always be so profoundly grateful.    After Churchillaposs death in  she broke royal protocol by arriving at his funeral before his family did. The Queen is supposed to be the last person to arrive at any official occasion - including a State Funeral - but the Monarch decided to get there before his grieving relatives. Nicholas explained what the Queen’s gesture meant to his family in the TV show. He said: It is absolutely exceptionalnot unique for the Queen to grant precedence to anyone. For her to arrive before the coffin and before my grandfather was a beautul and very touching gesture. Tony Blair Tony Blair has spoken on a number of occasions about how he felt he could tell the Queen absolutely anything, knowing it would never go any further. In an interview with the BBC he said: There is nothing you canapost say to the Queen. Speaking for a  documentary called aposMonarchy: The Royal Family at Workapos, he said: I’ve told her about lots of things in my time.    You know, everything from Cherie being pregnant with Leo through to, you know, major decisions. Because the one thing you know is that she will never ulge anything to anyone. However in his  book Comparative Politics: A Policy Approach foreign affairs writer Michael J Kryzanek said he believed the Queen and Blairaposs audiences probably were perfunctory. He said: Although Mr Blair’s reform of the aristocratic Lords and his Labour  Party’s traditional public criticism of the monarchy would likely mean that the weekly discussion between the two is perfunctory.    In  Labouraposs Tony Blair was slammed for snubbing the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations to sun himself in the Males. The ex-Prime Minister was invited to pay his respects in person but instead went for a holiday and sent a video tribute. Tory MP Priti Patel said: “He should be ashamed of himself. He spends a huge amount of time ­gallivanting round the world.” Buckingham Palace said: “There would have been no offence taken.” Anthony Eden Things were more formal between the Queen and Anthony Eden, who took over from Churchill. However it is reported that at one of their audiences they stayed clear of political chat and instead just listened as US astronaut John Glenn went into space on the radio.  Alec Douglas-Home The Queen reportedly spoke to Douglas-Home like an old friend, discussing dogs and going shooting together. Harold Wilson The Queen reportedly used to invite the Labour MP to join the Royals for picnics in Balmoral.  James Callaghan Mr Callaghan once said of the Queen: One of the great things about her is that she always seems able to see the funny side of le. All the conversations were very enjoyable. Sir John Major Major was well liked by the Royal Family as he has shown a deeply care for Princes William and Harry. After Dianaaposs death in  he was appointed specialto Princes Harry and William, and was responsible for legal and administrative matters.  Major, whose appointment was reported to have been made at the suggestion of Prince Charles, was asked to protect the interests of Harry and William in negotiations over their mother’s will. Lawyers for Sir John even went to court to seek powers to protect the princesapos financial interest in souvenirs and memorabilia related to their late mother the Princess of Wales. He was the only politician to be invited to Meghan Markle and Prince Harryaposs Royal Wedding last year.  Kensington Palace sources stressed in the run up to the wedding that those at the ceremony would be picked due to their relationship with the couple rather than the positions they hold.

If firms did not comply, workers would not necessarily be able to simply walk out - but could appeal to unions and the Health and Safety Executive.    Most workers in the UK have no legal safeguards protecting them from working during uncomfortably high temperatures or dangerous extreme heat. The current guidance states a minimum working temperature of C but does not include an upper limit. Under Labour ’s plan:If the indoor workplace temperature goes over C , employers will have to put in place effective temperature controls to help workers keep cool. These would include measures that many good employers already take: flexible working and travel arrangements, extra breaks, access to water, cooling systems air conditioning, flexible dress codes or the provision of protective clothing. Labour will task a proposed Royal Commission on Health and Safety at Work with bringing forward realistic proposals to protect all workers – including all outdoor workers - from extreme or uncomfortable temperatures at work.Last year the Environmental Audit Committee recommended a maximum workplace temperature. Laura Pidcock MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Labour, said: “As we’re all being reminded this week, working in hot conditions is really uncomfortable, often stressful and it makes us less productive and even ill. Plus it’s often the lowest paid and most insecure workers who suffer the most. “That’s why the next Labour government will demand that employers look after the needs of their workers during heatwaves like this. We believe everyone should have the right to basic protections from working in unbearably hot conditions. “Climate change is already making our shops, offices, call-centres and other workplaces too hot, and it’s also threatening the safety and health of old people, babies and many others.

She was driving to the shops on Saturday when the youngster began making muffled noises from the back seat. After pulling over and expecting to free him easily, Clare, , panicked when it failed to budge. Frightened Riley begged her to ring an ambulance but Clare rushed him to Lancaster Royal Infirmary, in Lancs, herself where several medics also failed to remove the lid. The little boyaposs tongue continued to swell rapidly until it turned black.  Clare was taken aside and told he would need major surgery - but there was a risk it could kill him. A team of  medics attended Rileyaposs operation and were finally able to remove the lid under sedation, meaning he left hospital with his tongue still intact - albeit with a temporary speech impediment. Now Clare is calling on parents to throw out any similar water bottles without safety gauze in to protect the tongue and is urging Sainsburyaposs to recall these bottles. Clare, from Carnforth, Lancaster, said: It was the scariest day of our lives. Iaposm still really shaken. I canapost stop looking at him and welling up. To think this is an everyday item most kids would have in their school lunch boxes - itaposs scary. Something like this could happen so easily. You never expect it. To other parents, please, just throw them away. Even as an adult, itaposs easy to put your tongue in these bottles messing around. I think all bottles should have a gauze or something to stop this happening again - and Sainsburyaposs should also recall [those that donapost]. Young Riley had planned to go shopping with his nana Cheryl Wooff, , last weekend when she gave him a bag of crisps and bottle of water.    Clare said: Iaposd taken Riley to football on Saturday morning then my mum rang to say did we want to go shopping. She made him a drink and a packet of crisps for football. She feels guilty now, but it wasnapost her fault at all. I heard a mumble and he started saying aposmum! mum! Iaposve got my tongue stuck!apos I thought it wasnapost anything major and we pulled over. I thought Iaposd get it out easily. I tried to undo the bottle top and seewe could get it free like that, but we couldnapost. Riley was shouting aposring an ambulance!apos All this time we didnapost think he was in danger, we felt a bit silly going into the hospital. We went in to AE and a nurse couldnapost loosen it either. Riley was really upset and screaming. A doctor managed to get the bottle off, then it was just the lid stuck on his tongue.

The unexpected closure of Monster Munchies has left brides-to-be without catering packages, decorations, DJs, dance floors and photo booths ahead of their big day. Samantha Cox and Darren Bott, who ran the firm, ceased trading last week, claiming they were aposvictims of their own successapos.A aposheartbrokenapos Ms Cox reached out to stressed-out customers with a post on her personal Facebook page, where she apologised for letting them down and explained there was a plan of action in place after seeking legal and financial advice, reports Birmingham Live. But the explanation provided little comfort for one bride-to-be, who was left in limbo just nine days before her big day. Since , Helen Hawthorne had paid the couple £, for a iety of services, including decorations, a DJ and photography. The -year-old, who is due to say aposI doapos on Saturday , found out about the firmaposs struggles online and immediately contacted the couple, demanding answers. Eventually, Ms Cox responded to an email, informing Miss Hawthorne that as she was aposlocalapos, the booking would be honoured - but by then it was too late. I told her weaposd already had to look at other suppliers as we had no ideatheyaposd show up on the day. We later found out that three other brides had been booked in on that day. Iaposd also seen her selling equipment online, so we had to look where. I asked for a refund but she said it wasnapost something that could be done quickly. Miss Hawthorne, of Walsall Wood, said the whole experience made her ill, adding: I didnapost sleep for three days.    We have managed to get other suppliers but Iaposm so angry that weaposve had to borrow money from our families to make sure weaposll have what weaposve already paid for. Another customer, who wished to remain anonymous, said she had booked a £ package, which included a flower wall and DJ, for her upcoming nuptuals. After the -year-old handed over a £ deposit, plus a £ apostravel feeapos, she was horried to stumble across a Facebook page that featured numerous bad reviews about the firm. People were saying that she hadnapost turned up on the day and had let them down, she said. I contacted her and asked for my money back but I was told the deposit was non-refundable but I could cancelI wanted to. The mother-of-two said Ms Cox offered her  chair covers and sashes as compensation - but onlysheaposd travel to pick them up. I didnapost want to spend any more money - itaposs a long way, I live in South East London  - and whatshe didnapost turn up  I just feel gutted about the whole situation. Iaposm an intelligent person but I just feel so foolish. The brides who were getting married at the weekend were devastated, they were left with no services or money. A support group for customers has been set up on Facebook - with members claiming they have spend an total of £, on services that were undelivered. However the group - which is one of many - is just fuelling the fire, according to Ms Cox, who insists they are doing the decent thing, regardless of what people think or say. Her statement said: We never set out to fraud or scam anyone despite a lot of lies flying around about us at present. We started our business in  and ran it very successfully for many years. But unfortunately we became victims of our own success and cracks began to appear. We managed to hold it together for a very long time. Things started to go wrong when other people got involved. Some unhappy customers and trolls began telling people to cancel our services so any money that was made was used to make refunds. This increased until any revenue we had we were having to use to pay back. This left no money for future bookings. At this time we are in receipt of no benefits, no tax credits, nothing. We relied solely on this business to pay our rent or lock up rent, van hire, travel costs, bills and anything  to do with the business. It soon became apparent that we were robbing Peter to pay Paul so relied on future bookings.  We NEVER intentionally took money to fraud anyone and had every intention of doing everyoneaposs bookings. Ms Cox said the decision to wrap up the business was taken on Tuesday night, adding her partner had contacted as many people as possible explaining the current situation. She added: We have ceased trading. We are in the process of selling everything we own in the hope we can pay everyone back what we owe. This is not going to be a quick fix. Let it be known we have not run away with anyone’s money. We are not running away from our responsibilities and are working with iniduals to resolve this.

What she didnapost realise - as the sun beat down on her - was that something was going on below her waist. It was only when she got home and stripped off her branded Adidas leggings that she realised what had happened. The logo of the sportswear company had been negatively branded onto her skin, with the burnt red area around the letters highlighting the pale skin of the German clothing firm. It was when I went to put on my bikini that I saw my leg, Danielle said. I thought aposOh my godapos. I was in fits of laughter.  Suspecting that the logo will fade from her leg by the morning, the Poole, Dorset woman was quick to capitalise on the unusual occurence. As well as collecting loads of shares when she posted it online, Danielle contacted Adidas askingthey would hire her as an on-brand model. Sadly the company turned down her request, complementing her on a nice tan before admitting it only took sponsorship bids from Australia and Germany. Danielle seems to have drawn a particularly unlucky card.    According to Bupa, leggings are typically a very good item of clothing to stave off sunburn. Long pants or leggings cover more skin than shorts, and a broad brim hat provides more protection than a baseball cap, the private health firm explained. It seems like Bupa hadnapost reckoned either with the recent ferocity of Britainaposs sun or with the thin material of the Adidas leggings.As the heatwave kicked into force at the beginning of July Brits caught out not having properly lathered themselves in sun cream shared their burn photos."},{"url":null,"title":"mum who gave birth loo","story":"NewsMum who gave birth on toilet told to say goodbye before babys miracle recoverySarah Donaldson, , went into labour with daughter Kiara  weeks early - giving birth to her as she sat on the toilet seat at her home in Stoke-on-Trent, StaffordshireShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsBaby Kiara with mum Sarah Donaldson - who was told to say goodbye to her daughter born  weeks premature \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who gave birth on the toilet at home was told to say goodbye to her premature daughter before the tiny baby made a aposmiracleapos recovery. Sarah Donaldson, , went into labour with daughter Kiara  weeks early - giving birth to her as she sat on the toilet seat at her home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.The first-time mum had started suffering from stabbing pains when she was  weeks pregnant, but was told by medics they were normal aposgrowing painsapos. After giving birth at home, Sarah and Kiara were rushed to hospital where the terried mum was told her new baby had a had a bleed on both sides of her brain and her lung. Sarah and her husband Paul, , were then given the devastating news that it was likely Kiara wouldnapost pull through and they were told to say their goodbyes. But against all the odds, Kiara pulled through and is now a happy -month-old infant.   Sarah, a customer services advisor, said: “The thought of losing our baby and having to say our final goodbyes was agonising. “Paul and I were trying our best to keep it together and stay strong, but in the back of my mind I didn’t think we would be taking her home. “Our eyes were glued to the machines hooked up to her whilst holding her tiny hand thinking ‘please don’t leave us.’ I had a smooth pregnancy up until I suddenly gave birth. I couldn’t wait for Paul and I to have a family of our own. “But at  weeks, I had concerns as I was in agony, I knew something wasn’t right, we went to pregnancy assessment unit but we were sent away with ‘growing pains’. “About ten hours passed and Paul rang  again and as he was on the phone I went to the toilet. “I felt like the gravity was pulling me down as a gush of water came out – I thought it was urine as I felt better straight away. “I shouted to Paul to tell him the pain had finally gone, but within seconds, it ed, and I realised I was about to give birth.    “Thankfully, Paul was already on the phone to the emergency services who arrived in about three minutes, but I already had Kiara in my arms.” The couple initially thought their baby was stillborn as she was swollen and bruised – but after warming her up using towels, she began to show signs of le whilst they waited for the ambulance. She adds: “She didn’t come out screaming, Paul and I thought we had lost her until she made a weird little noise. “I began rubbing her back to stimulate her breathing and thankfully the ambulance had arrived. “They took her straight to the hospital and we followed behind, when we got there, I had a quick look at her and then I didn’t see her again for three hours as they were doing scans and tests. “I was surprisingly calm as it was all happening so fast, I was in shock. “She was in the NICU and we prepared to say goodbye as her oxygen levels weren’t high enough and she was so tiny. An oxygen reading of  to  per cent is a normal for a healthy baby, but Kiara’s was at  per cent.  Medics told the parentsit didn’t increase that she would not survive. Miraculously, Kiara’s levels went up within one hour but the parents were then informed a bleed was affecting both sides of her brain. Sarah added: “The first  hours of Kiara’s le were a rollercoaster, something good was always followed with something bad. “We didn’t knowwe would ever take our little girl home, I was preparing for the worst but also trying to be positive. “It was so hard seeing her in the incubator with wires everywhere and not knowingshe is going to pull through all night. “At night-time we could hear all the other babies crying, but we didn’t have ours. “We were distraught, but we tried to stay positive and prayed our little girl will make it through. “She had a stage two bleed on one side of her brain and stage four on the other, we were warned she might have a weakness on the right side of her body.

As a ft in woman, I’m not expected to be strong. So when I pick up a kg barbell – twice my body weight – there are often a few jaws on the floor. The truth is, I’m officially the world’s strongest woman, and can lt the equivalent of a pygmy hippopotamus. But I haven’t always been athletic. Until a few years ago, I’d never really thought about what my body could do.    I’ve always struggled with my size, so when my sister announced she was getting married and asked me to be her bridesmaid, we decided to lose weight together. At the time I was feeling quite lost. My daughters were both young, I hadn’t gone back to work and I was very overweight. We joined a Crossfit gym. I was apprehensive but at my first session there were lots of new members, which put me at ease. I loved the combination of weightlting and cardio exercise. By the wedding I’d lost four stone. I also found I had a natural talent for lting weights. In one class, we had to lt a barbell from the floor above our heads  times. I did it in less than five minutes. The instructor was amazed. They’d never seen a woman do it so quickly and suggested I take up weight training. I found a local trainer and told him I wanted to enter strong woman competitions. He said Britain’s Strongest Woman was weeks away and I signed up. He warned me some of his clients had been training for months but I wasn’t deterred. Six weeks later I competed to be Britain’s Strongest Woman, with my mum and husband cheering on the sidelines. As the scores racked up, I realised I wasn’t doing too badly. But I couldn’t believe it when I came third.    Now I wanted to compete more and more. For the first time in my le, I liked my body. Instead of focusing on what I looked like, I started to realise the incredible things my body could do. Over the next few years, I won Britain’s Strongest Woman three times and, in , set my sights on the World’s Strongest Woman competition. That December, I flew to America for the contest. The first event involved lting three dferent weights in as short a time as possible – the heaviest was kg, the weight of a pygmy hippo. The following day, I did a sandbag throw – throwing a weighted sack over a -metre post. Next, I had to lt a series of heavy objects over my head, including a kg axle and a kg log. The final day saw the most gruelling event. I would have to run for m carrying a yoke weighing kg, then add a kg sandbag and do it again. As I heaved the yoke onto my shoulders, every muscle was pushed to the limit. But I finished with the quickest time and to my delight, was crowned world’s strongest woman. My family were so proud of me. The soft and squishy body is gone. Instead, I’m muscular and toned.

As the head of the family, the Monarch makes time to have one-to-one chats with everyone to check how theyaposre doing and what theyaposre up to. But according to a royal expert there was one member of her family that she really, really dreaded speaking to. Ingrid Seward claims that the Queen didnapost enjoy her conversations with her daughter-in-law Princess Diana, saying they left her feeling drained and confused.    In her book The Queen  Di: The Untold Story, she writes: The Queen came to dread these meetings with her daughter-in-law. They left her feeling drained and despondent and confused - an uncommon state for a woman accustomed to the certainties of her position. According to the Express, Diana took this as jealousy but the Queen shot this down with a quick comment. There was a huge amount of excitement surrounding the new young princess when she married Prince Charles and became part of the Royal Family.    Royal author Penny Junor wrote: Diana’s popularity was phenomenal but it was not the first time that the nation, or indeed the world, had fallen in love with a beautul royal princess. When the mania over Diana was at its height, one of the Queen’s courtiers said, ‘Ma’am, you will never have seen anything like the publicity Charles and Diana are having’. ‘You were not around,’ she said witheringly, ‘when Margaret and I were having our future husbands talent-spotted for us’.Despite their dferences, the Queen decided to invite Diana to a State Banquet after her separation from Charles even though it didnapost go down well with the rest of the family. And her reason for including her daughter-in-law is actually rather sad. She believed that despite their dferences there was a chance that Diana and Charles would get back together. The Queen also invited Diana to Sandringham for Christmas in , a year after their split. She stayed overnight and went to church with the royals on Christmas morning, but left before they all sat down for their traditional festive lunch.

Records could be broken not only for July, but the UK could see aposall time recordsapos smashed. Today is expected to see the peak in temperatures with C possible in the south east of England.  Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: The UK will experience another pulse of high temperatures this week, with the possibility of records being broken for not only July but also all-time records. The weather setup is broadly similar to the pattern that brought high temperatures to much of continental Europe at the end of June.

Experts have spoken out about the best ways to stay healthy in the heatwave as well as urging people to check on the vulnerable or elderly as temperatures soar. Englandaposs chief nurse has urged people to check on their neighbours as a heatwave hits parts of the UK for the start of the school summer holidays.

Claire Huggins, from the National Water Safety Forum, said: At this time of year and with this type of weather it is really tempting to go for a swim.

But experts have advised people to turn off their fans today - because itaposs actually going to be TOO HOT. Yep, thataposs actually a thing. Using your fan today could terryingly actually make your room even hotter -thataposs even possible.  According to the Governmentaposs heatwave plan, electric fans only workitaposs less than C. This is because when it gets that hot fans just blow hot air directly on people, which makes them even hotter rather than cooling them down. Quoting research from the Cochrane Review, the plan states: Use of fans at temperatures above C fans may not prevent heat related illness. Additionally fans can cause excess dehydration. The advice is to place the fan at a certain distance from people, not aiming it directly on the body and to have regular drinks.  This is especially important in the case of sick people confined to bed. Records could be broken not only for July, but the UK could see aposall time recordsapos smashed. Today is expected to see the peak in temperatures with C possible in the south east of England.The Met Office says weather conditions will be similar to continental Europe, with sizzling highs in the day and muggy conditions continuing overnight this week.

Keri Lynn Noble, , felt pressure to looked tanned while performing as a cheerleader at football games. But when the cruise ship worker noticed a small scab on her forehead, she never expected it would lead to a cancer diagnosis and multiple surgeries leaving her with a hole in her head Keri said: I was first diagnosed in  when I noticed a scab on the forehead that wouldn’t heal. With the brush of my T-shirt or when I washed my face the scab always would open up, and that’s when I knew something was wrong. I work on cruise ships so I had to wait until I was home to see my family’s skin doctor - he determined it was a basil cell carcinoma and it needed to be removed. The doctor never said it was directly because of the sunbeds, but a mix of sun over-exposure and the beds is what caused it. Keri had been going on sunbeds since the age of  as it was something all girls her age was doing.    Keri, from Cincinnati, Ohio, said: I was a cheerleader for my high school and I always wanted to look tanned in my unorm. Throughout high school I was using the tanning beds more and more all the girls on the cheerleading team wanted to be tanned before the football and basketball games and before any school and dances too. After college I went to school for dance and I was on the dance team there. As I was still in the public eye a lot, I wanted to make sure I looked like the complete package. After Keriaposs diagnosis in , she underwent MOHS surgery, which is a precise surgical technique used to treat skin cancer. During MOHS surgery, thin layers of cancer-containing skin are progressively removed and examined until only cancer-free tissue remains She said: I was upset when they had to perform the first MOHS surgery.    I remember growing up my mother always talked to me about skincare and how skin cancer runs in the family but I would just brush it off and tell her I have more of my fatheraposs skin type. The wound healed up nicely after the surgery and for two years I thought I was in the clear until I saw the scab reappear in the same place on my forehead. It began to open again with a slight brush of anything - I knew it wasn’t good. Last year Keri went to see the same doctor as before and confirmed her worst fears that the skin cancer had ed and that she needed to undergo the MOHS surgery once again. She said: At that time I was extremely scared as I thought the whole piece was removed and now it was back. This time during the MOHS procedure, the doctor had to go back in five times to remove layers of skin. The tiny skin cancer had doubled in size and turned into a tumour the size of a golf ball.  At this point he looked at me and said I have to be sent to a plastic surgeon. Keri went on to see a plastic surgeon who she says aposmade miracles happenapos. The surgeon closed up the golf ball sized tumour on Keriaposs forehead by moving and stretching the skin from her eyebrow to connect with the skin on her hairline. She added: I was so pleased everything went to plan and that he [the surgeon] was able to do the procedure. They didn’t think it was even possible but he made it happen. For about two months I had one eyebrow lted about two inches from the other, but now it has been five months and my eyebrow is almost the back to normal - you can hardly even tell I had the procedure.

Monica Thompson, , believed she couldn’t have children after struggling to conceive with her late husband Kevin Thompson for  years before his death in . But she was left stunned when a blood test revealed she was expecting - before going into labour with little Jayden the very next day. When Monica, from Las Vegas, USA, met her partner Jason Ratlf in , she had already made peace with the idea that she’d never be a mother. Monica, a cook, said: “My husband Kevin and I tried to have children but it just never happened for us. We did everything we could but we weren’t in a financial position to try IVF. When I turned  I became content with being a dog mother. I figured they could be my babies. I have a niece also and she’s really special to me. When Kevin died in , I put having a family out of my mind completely. “I met Jason when we matched on an app and we really hit it off.    We moved in together in October  so it was really quick but we didn’t consider the idea of becoming pregnant.” Monica thought she was entering menopause when she began to experience what she believed to be incontinence in September, a symptom of the le change. She was still menstruating each month, but said her periods were lighter and more erratic than usual. When Monica began to experience nausea and cramping on October , she left work early to visit her local urgent care center and was shocked when a blood test revealed she was pregnant. Monica added: “I’m a cook so when I started throwing up, I knew I had to go home. My fiance picked me up and he drove me to the urgent care center. They didn’t have the equipment to do an ultrasound, but they asked methere was any way I could be pregnant. “I said, ‘No way’. I believed I was starting menopause because I was having a little trouble with incontinence. Or at least I thought I was but actually it ended up being amniotic fluid that was leaking.    “They did some blood work and they came back and told me I was pregnant. I was shocked and in disbelief. I thought I couldn’t have babies. “Looking at me you would never have known, I wasn’t showing at all. “They did something called the finger test and estimated that I was about six months pregnant. “They told me I urgently needed to book an ultrasound with an OBGYN, but as it was the weekend, the best I could do was on Monday.” Monica ed to work the next day but immediately began experiencing cramps and bleeding. At the end of the sht, Monica rushed to University Medical Center, Las Vegas, where doctors quickly discovered she was five centimeters dilated and in labor. “I was shocked to learn I had been in labor all day. “They did a vaginal exam to discover the source of the bleeding and they determined my amniotic sac had ruptured and I had been leaking fluid. “In fact, the fluid had been leaking for months and I had mistaken it for urine and incontinence associated with menopause. “The doctor told me I was dilated about five centimeters and I started freaking out. Not even  hours before I was told I was pregnant and here I was already in laboir.    “They told me I needed an emergency C-section which was frightening.” Doctors safely delivered Monica’s son Jayden, lb oz, in the early hours of October , who was immediately rushed to the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit . Using a ballard test, Jayden’s physicians estimated the tot was born at  weeks which meant Monica was pregnant for seven and a half months without realizing. “I couldn’t see the baby until the next day because of my surgery but when I did see him for the first time he was covered in wires, said Monica. “I got to hold him for the first time a week later, and it was surreal. I thought aposWow, I’m a momapos. It felt right. I felt complete.” The new mom said it was dficult to look at her son in the NICU and worried thatshe had known of her pregnancy, things may have been dferent. Monica had recently taken up a new fitness regime and diet and dropped lbs during her pregnancy, which doctors said made a dference.  She added: “I felt so bad because I wonderedI had known about the pregnancy, maybe he wouldn’t have been in danger. “But the doctors said I took very good care of myself during that time and not to worry so much. “I feel a little robbed of my pregnancy. I never felt my baby move and I never got to have that ultrasound moment where I saw his heart beat.” Monica and Jason, who became her fiance in May, said they will always be grateful for the kindness of those around them after welcoming their unexpected baby. She said: Luckily, Jason’s brother had a baby one year before, so they were kind enough to give us all the baby clothes and a bunch of toys. Everyone at my work was so kind, donating wipes and diapers. They were so supportive. They couldn’t believe I was that pregnant, it was shocking to everyone.

And said males are part of the reason why youaposre not getting enough shut eye, with a partneraposs snoring robbing many of their sleep, alongside other factors such as period pain and waking up to look after the kids.All of this is leaving a lot of women at the end of their tether. This is according to the results of a survey by Bensons for Beds, where , couples were quizzed about their sleeping habits.The study found that lack of sleep makes women feel less confident about themselves and their appearance and can have a detrimental impact on their daily activities - with healthy eating being the first thing to go out the window when theyaposre tired. A third of ladies said they woke up every single night, with one in two describing themselves as being constantly sleep deprived. In comparison, only two in  men reporting that their sleep was regularly disrupted.One in three participants also said the exhaustion was making them depressed and a whopping  percent were at their wits end. As well as impacting our mental health, lack of sleep can also cause a number of other worrying problems.The NHS website explains: Regular poor sleep puts you at risk of serious medical conditions, including obesity, heart disease and diabetes - and it shortens your le expectancy.Most of us need around eight hours of good-quality sleep a night toproperly - but some need more and some less. What matters is that you find out how much sleep you need and then try and achieve it. They go on to offer this advice: If youaposve had months of restricted sleep, youaposll have built up a signicant sleep debt, so expect recovery to take several weeks. They recommend trying to catch up on sleep over the weekend, adding an extra hour or two a night and not setting an alarm clockpossible. Expect to sleep for upwards of  hours a night at first, they add. After a while, the amount of time you sleep will gradually decrease to a normal level.

at the stadium in  and - in  to kill qualication bids for Euro  and .McInnes is determined there will be no Tbilisi pain for his side despite temperatures of around C.He said: “We are very mindful of the Scotland team coming here and being undone.“Emerging countries like Georgia are getting stronger and stronger.“You may not have heard too much about a team, but when you dig deeper and deeper you can find things like they are backed financially by a wealthy owner.“That seems to be the case here and the level of player they are able to attract.“This game is over two legs for us and we don’t expect to win the tie in the first leg.“But we certainly don’t want to be out of the tie in the first leg.“We have to get the balance between attacking and defending right against a capable side.“And try to take a positive result back to Aberdeen.”Despite a late kick off at .pm local time, the mercury is still predicted to be close to C with stling humidity.McInnes insists he has previous experience of dealing with high temperatures in Europe and refuses to make it an issue.He said: “It feels humid enough and the kick-off time being pushed back may help things.“We played in similar conditions in Macedonia, Kazakhstan and in Rijeka in Croatia, which was probably the worst of them all in terms of that side of it.“It is another challenge and an obstacle put in front of the team at this stage when we are still searching for that top fitness.“However, we have shown in the past that has never really hampered us.“I am hoping tonight that will not hamper us as once the ball rolls we will see the competitive side of the team.“You just have to deal with the outside factors – whether that is an Astro pitch or hot conditions.“The game is too important to be worrying or dwelling on that.”Chikhura Sachkhere are  games into their domestic season and knocked Luxembourg side CS Fola Esch out in the last round.McInnes had both those ties scouted and believes tonight’s clash will be a step up from RoPS Rovaniemi of Finland.He said: “Once the game starts you kind of have a better idea.“They are similar to a lot of teams we have played against where they are happy in possession and are good technical players.“We set out to try and dominate possession of the ball as they support their main striker quickly.“There are four behind their main striker and they like to take a touch and go past their main striker when they break.“They have a good counter attacking threat and a lot of players very comfortable on the ball.“When we watched them in their own league, maybe something to do with the temperatures over here, it does seem a slightly slower pace to what we normally play at.“They had two very impressive performances against Fola Esch and handled both games very well.“That is the two games we have really concentrated on and we see their capabilities.“I would expect the Georgians to be a step up from Rovaniemi.“When you progress through the rounds you expect that.”A crowd of around , is anticipated at the , capacity stadium.Chikhura Sachkhere have had to play their tie at the national arena as their own ,-capacity Central Stadium does not meet the requirements set down by UEFA to host a Euro tie.They have travelled  miles from their base, a journey that takes three hours.The Georgians are so desperate to boost crowd numbers they have made tonight’s game free entry to supporters of both teams.It is a bid to entice neutral Georgians in the nation’s capital to come along.Less than , fans,  of them from Aberdeen, are expected tonight.Aberdeen will be without Greg Leigh, Mikey Devlin and Connor McLennan for the tie.None of them made the six-hour, ,-mile flight to Georgia due to injury.However, Craig Bryson and recent £, signing from Scunthorpe Funso Ojo are both in contention to make their Dons debuts.“Greg Leigh, Mikey Devlin, Connor McLennan and Ethan Ross have been left back,” McInnes said.“Ethan and Connor picked up little strains up at Keithon Saturday.“They are both soft tissue injuries, nothing serious, and I think both will be fine to train in the middle of next week.“Greg we feel can probably make the second leg.“He was probably just too keen on pushing it.“We would rather get him % as we said about Bryson.“Mikey is making progress but is going to be two or three weeks away.“Bryson has travelled and Ojo is in the squad.“Both of them are a bit behind the rest of our lads, but both are able to contribute for some part of the game anyway.”In a quirk of fate, should Aberdeen progress past the Georgians they will set up a third qualying round clash with HNK Rijeka of Georgia.Aberdeen beat Rijeka away from home - four years ago to progress in Europe – one of the most memorable Euro wins by a Scottish team.McInnes refuses to look beyond the Georgians.He said: “I am reluctant to speak too much about Rijeka as we have to deal with this team.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.43844611-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.43844611-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.43844611-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.43844611-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"o2 to bring 5g network to aberdeen in 2020","story":"A mobile network is planning to roll out G coverage to Aberdeen in summer next year.O confirmed that it will switch its new G network on in October, which will see it go live to  towns and cities across the UK.A further  areas will be included in the next roll-out, which will be in place by summer .This includes Aberdeen, as well as Glasgow.Edinburgh is the first Scottish city to receive the new network, and is part of the first phase.G could be up to  times faster than G.It will ensure people get more data, more quickly, and will be useful for streaming high-definition video and gaming.Mark Evans, CEO of Telefonica UK, said: “G is going to be a game changer for our country.“Whether it’s for people or businesses, the power of this next-generation network is going to unlock a world of possibilities for our economy and society.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

Amongst the animals they hunted were bears, which are now a strong emblem at Traquair.Traquair also played host to Mary Queen of Scots in  when she visited with her husband Darnley. Traquair still has the bed where she slept and the cradle where she rocked her baby, later James V of Scotland and I England.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Traquair House\",\"description\": \"Traquair House\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs ebYSWHp-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ebYSWHp.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": The Stuarts of Traquair have been in residence since  and the house remains a family home today.

In recent weeks, for background to a book Irsquom writing about Mary Queen of Scots ndash donrsquot yawn! ndash Irsquove been visiting some of the locations of her troubled years here. Despite a lelong interest in history, doubtless in part due to early brainwashing, I have been shamed to discover how much of the past there is, within easy reach, that Irsquove never bothered to seek out or explore.When it comes to ill-fated Mary, Historic Environment Scotland offers a guide to most of the key points in her tale, as found in old buildings and sites. Itrsquos a clever idea, pandering to an international fascination with her that never fades. Of all our prominent figures, not even Charles Edward Stuart has the abiding allure of this deeply tragic royal. Hence the number of visitors from Japan and America in Linlithgow Palace, where she was born, or the Germans photographing forbidding Hermitage Castle in the Borders, where she paid a fleeting visit to the wounded Earl of Bothwell, a trip that cost her dear.Yet what is immediately obvious is how few locals there are clambering up Dumbarton Rock, where she stayed for months as a child, before being whisked to safety in France, or on the woodland paths around the site of the Battle of Carberry Hill, where her fate was effectively sealed.Arguably the most important location, Dundrennan Abbey in Dumfries  Galloway, had no other visitors whatsoever while I was there at the weekend. It hardly appears to be on anyonersquos radar, even though in terms of Mary it is hugely symbolic, being the very last place she slept before leaving for England. When her boat reached Cumbria, from the tiny nearby port, she was to spend the rest of her le in captivity. There is far more to Dundrennan, however, than the memory of Maryrsquos passing. A tranquil haven, in lush countryside close to the sea, this th-century Cistercian abbey survived the wars of independence, though not the tumult of the Reformation. Above all, it is architecturally fascinating, showing the arrival of the gothic style in Scotland.The enchanting narrow and winding roads around here, and for that matter all across this un-sung region, were almost car free. Yoursquore more likely to encounter a milk tanker than a motorcycle. Put a grandfather clock in our back seat, and we could have been on The Antiques Roadshow, tootling through bucolic pastoral scenery, one foot firmly planted in yesteryear.The richness of history that lies all around us is staggering. Yet, either because of over-familiarity, complacency or lack of knowledge, it is half-forgotten or ignored. Even our glitziest period celebrity cannot draw crowds much beyond the central belt. Scotlandrsquos bygone affairs, you might say, do not have the magnetic pull of British history ndash ie, English ndash in whose shadow they have lain for as long as time has been measured.Population density and accessibility in part explain why English monuments and castles are crawling with tourists, whereas the wind whistles emptily through many of ours. Stonehenge, just off a convenient main road, attracts millions, whereas to visit the far eerier Callanish Stones on the isle of Lewis requires determination and planning. Nor could the ferry cope with a sudden surge in traffic.But therersquos more to it than that. Until fairly recently, our history was seen by those who shaped the curriculum, and the political agenda, as a branch of a bigger tree. Despite the profoundly influential impact of our royal dynasties across all these isles, and our complex, sophisticated political system, even today most of us are still probably better versed in Tudor kings and queens than in the equally colourful Stuarts.While we live in more enlightened times now, connecting with our past is as much our own responsibility as that of the educational or cultural establishment. Who cares whether British history gets more attention than Scottish, Welsh or Irish  The abundance of clues left by our forebears is a priceless record, a heritage written plain and loud as a redtop headline. We donrsquot need permission, or a professional go-between, to discover it for ourselves.School teachers are well aware that facts and dates rarely stick without something to bring them alive. Visit Scotland, and the past rises to meet you at every turn. Some of it lies beneath our feet, the bones of early civilisation, or the work of long-gone farmers, still visible ason an x-ray. Castles, forts, mines and harbours are all within easy reach of most of us. As scaremongers like to say of rats, yoursquore never more than a few feet from a fragment of history anywhere in this land.Indeed, therersquos so much of it you can understand why some people feel oppressed, fearing that to pay our national saga too much attention will hold us back. For me, though, the wealth of evidence is invigorating. Following in the footsteps of a figure such as Mary Queen of Scots is to feel an almost tangible connection. Rather than highlighting how far distant were the times in which she lived, it has the opposite effect. Listening to crows cawing on the rooftop of Linlithgow Palace, or the kittiwakes nesting on the ruins of Dunbar Castle looking out across Arthurrsquos Seat from Craigmillar Castle, or to the English coast from the beach near Dundrennan, is actually to sense that those who shaped our country were in most important respects not much dferent from us.As Irsquom belatedly learning, jaunts to castles and battle sites are a three-dimensional holiday, offering a perspective that reaches deep into the archives. Rather than encouraging nostalgia or sentiment, it is instead a bracing reminder of the urgent need to live in the here and now. Therersquos nothing like a ruin to show you how quickly time catches us all."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mavericks-try-revive-independence-39-plan-b-39","story":"Western Isles MP Angus Brendan MacNeil and Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny said a ldquoPlan B was neededthe new PM blocks a second referendum.Their idea is thatMr Johnson refuses to grant Holyrood the power to hold a vote using a Section  order, a simple election win would be used as a mandate for ending the Union.If pro-independence SNP and Green candidates won a majority of seats at the next Westminster or Holyrood election, it would trigger independence negotiations.The Scottish Tories accused them of droning on \"like golfclub bores\".:SNP mavericks suggest a new route to independenceThe idea flies in the face of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos repeated insistence that the legally-binding referendum process of  is the ldquogold standard and only template for Indyref.PM Boris makes myself an @SNPChris take Independence Plan B back to SNP conference as an amendment - we need the independence volume turned up! #indyref #hope https:t.co oGdhZJbQThe First Minister has said she wants to hold another referendum in late , but has so far failed to say what she would dothe PM refused to grant a Section  order.Theresa May simply stonewalled a previous request from MSPs in .With parts of the Yes movement impatient for action, and worried about another refusal, Mr MacNeil and Mr McEleny tried to get their idea debated at the SNPrsquos autumn conference.However their motion was rejected by the SNP leadership, with national secretary Angus MacLeod dismissing the idea as ldquohastily written, almost whimsically so.Mr MacLeod also said it was ldquowholly inappropriate for the pair to brief the media about it.Mr MacNeil said he was ldquoutterly stumped by the decision earlier this month.:SNP MP utterly stumped by partys refusal to debate independence planHowever he and Mr McEleny now want to resurrect the idea by amending an uncontroversial motion about  years of Holyrood to get the subject debated and voted on by delegates.They are urging SNP activists to email Mr MacLeod to add their names to their amendment, which would instruct the SNP to put the Plan B idea into its next manesto.The text of their amendment says: ldquoThe manesto for the next Scottish or UK Parliamentary election ndash whichever may come first ndash shall state that, a pro independence electoral victory shall be a mandate from the people of Scotland to commence independence negotiations with the UK Government.Mr MacNeil said: ldquoAll Scotland is aghast at the latest choice being foisted on our country.ldquoClearly Boris and his party are not Scotlandrsquos choice and havenrsquot been for over six decades, and we can see from our independent Nordic and Irish neighbours that there is a better way.ldquoScotland has a mandate for a referendum on independence and Westminster must respect this.

But never fear, say his supporters, it will all work out in the end. This, according to the Johnson faithful, is how his premiership will play out. Essentially it is his stint as London mayor Leave campaign chief revisited. He plays the role of charismatic central figure. Around him will be packed ious Rasputins, clever chaps, perhaps even a few chapesses, who will come up with the ideas and, courtesy of their cult-like zeal, will work night and day to get them through, by any means necessary.

Has anyone bothered to remind us that Scotland spends pound. billion more than it raises in taxes whilst the Scottish NHS costs around pound billion annually to run  No one has taken the time to tell us which taxes would increase and which welfare services would be cut and by how much to reduce this deficit.Again, in the rush to promote the break-up of the Union no one has bothered to discuss the minor irritant for Scots who have taken out their mortgages in sterling of the distinct possibility that their wages will be paid in a new Scottish currency which could be worth less than sterling. Do pensioners really want to take the risk of having their pensions paid in a new Scottish currency whilst the rest of the UK continue to receive theirs in sterling  It really is unbelievable that such important information is not even being discussed in this latest round of independence is just around the corner.The fact that independence is always discussed, stripped of its economic context, gives rise to the promotion of shallow but seductive tropes such as independence is the obvious alternative to a Johnson-led hard Brexit. But is it really  My hunch is that when people become aware of the turbo-charged austerity which would inevitably follow independence, that staying in the UK trumps a Johnson-led hard Brexit.Because of the appalling level of debate when it comes to constitutional issues the great worry is that the country could sleepwalk into independence. The crucial challenge for the majority who wish to remain in the UK is to recalibrate the independence debate to focus on the crucial economic consequences of independence that are never discussed: consequences such as how to pay off our fiscal deficit and our population shareof UK debt and how to find the pound billion to buy the currency reserves to fund a new currency to mention but a few.Robert Hoskins, Glasgow G.LIKE many who cannot accept our devolved power in Scotland and fancully believe all would be well with separation from the UK, Hugh Kerrseems to me to confuse personalities with policy.Having lived through  Prime ministers I can assure him that, to the public at least, politics is very often no more than a passing parade. Boris Johnson will come and go like the rest of them. If he attempts to behave presidentially he will doubtless meet the same fate as Margaret Thatcher.Although I personally feel that we have had to suffer the enervation imposed by the Tory Party elevating their court jester when our reserves were still depleted by Brexit, this is surely a time to keep the ship on an even keel.The ldquowake-up call advocated by Mr Kerr and targeted at the SNP is surely misdirected and as many would suggest, should be aimed at the Liberal Democrats. I consider that the Labour Party has, through self-inflicted errors of judgment, managed to make itself less likely to be elected into power than at any time since the Second World War.It is now for Jo Swinson, leader of the LibDems, to ldquodo a Boris and rally the troops while the Conservative party is still in conflict with itself.

The minute the result of the  Scottish independence referendum was announced, the SNP declared it was on the offensive. The minute the  Brexit referendum was announced, the SNP declared it was on the offensive. The minute Boris Johnsons premiership was announced, the SNP immediately declared itself on the offensive. All three events linked by the \" necessity\" for Scotland to go its own way.In these five years, Scotland has not done very well, but the important question is would it have been betterwe had split from England  The answer is resoundingly \"no\". The proof is the current state of Scotlands already-devolved powers and the numerous failures these have engendered. Saying that given all powers this would be so much better, is demonstrably wrong. The SNP is seeking any excuse to seize any half-chance to promote independence. That suggests desperation.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IF there was ever a crystal-clear indication of the pathetic state of the Labour Party in Scotland it is surely the comments by Labour councillor Alex Gallagher .On the day when the United Kingdom has had possibly the worst Prime Minister ever forced upon it by an extreme right-wing element within the Tory Party how does this representative of the Labour Party react  He writes a letter criticising the First Minister. You really could not make it up. If Mr Gallagher genuinely cared about this \"United\" Kingdom his thoughts and actions should have been directed towards ways to counteract the little Englander policies which Boris Johnson espouses.Not only does this show that Labour is in a deep hole but it also tells us that Mr Gallagher and his cohorts just cant stop digging.David Stubley, Prestwick.LIKE him or not, Boris Johnson has the same charismatic charm and panache as Alex Salmond used to have with the people and Scottish folk will soon warm to him as a politician with real character.He has a very dficult ahead taking the UK out of Europe but he is the one politician who has the capability to deliver to the people what they actually voted for.Dennis Forbes Grattan, Aberdeen AB.THE village joker has been anointed the saviour of the nasty party.

They have been accused of being noisy, intrusive, dangerous to wildle and a blot on the landscape.Onshore turbines are hugely important for energy generation they currently make up more than % of installed renewables capacity in Scotland.But Trump is not the only one to criticise the aesthetic impact of wind infrastructure .Other critics also consider that onshore developments compromise vistas across beautul countryside. They include Ramblers Scotland, which has claimed they are destroying Scotlandrsquos unique countryside and Mountaineering Scotland, which is also concerned that some developments are detrimentally affecting the mountain landscape.There is a strong counter argument that rows of slowly spinning turbines have a haunting, mesmeric beauty. If they are an art form to some, however, they are an overwhelmingly unorm one. Small wind farms, big wind farms, solo turbines ndash you see one, and yoursquove pretty much seen them all.This is not purely because of a lack of imagination to date in design. Current turbines, known as horizontal axis devices, are generally highly efficient in a way that is dficult to replicate in other configurations.However, they do have weaknesses, such as being able to capture wind in only one direction, so losing their efficiency when the flow becomes unpredictable.Two Lancaster University students, Nicolas Orellana and Yaseen Noorani, won the James Dyson Award last year for a radical new design called the O-Wind Turbine. It uses a cm spinning sphere sitting on a fixed axis and works with the wind blowing in any direction, making it particularly suitable for urban areas.Another even more unconventional potential solution is the Autonomous Tethered Aerostat an airborne wind turbine developed by the Boston-based company Altaeros Energies.This tethered blimp-like device looks like a giant tyre and floats in the air at a height of more than  metres. It provides a very dferent visual alternative to the traditional design, but its main benefit is that can harness the stronger winds found at altitude, also reducing ground noise and speeding up the investment payback period.Another advantage of the helium-filled AWT, which is assembled from the same material used for advanced racing sailing yachts, is that it is more visible to birds than the current horizontal axis turbines, which have been accused of being damaging to wildle.Other possibilities for the future include vertical axis turbines ndash originally conceived as a sail design by the ancient Persians ndash and bladeless inventions using spinning discs.There are also whale fin, helical shaped, windspire, windbelt, spiral drag and sky serpent designs, most looking as exotic as their names. But at present little has moved beyond, or even as far as, prototype stage.Dr Sergio Campobasso is a Senior Lecturer in Renewable Energy Engineering at Lancaster University and an authority on wind turbine design. He says that efficiency and aesthetics are competing issues: ldquoThere is a theoretical limit in terms of the energy that can be harvested from the wind, and the horizontal axis model is quite close to that.ldquoSome people do find that design boring. There are alternatives such as the vertical axis model, where the blades are parallel to the shaft, which may be considered more attractive. ldquoThe efficiency of these isnrsquot quite as high and there have been some issues with wind flow, but with progress in materials and better understanding of aerodynamics this design is being revisited.ldquoHowever, there isnrsquot nearly the same technological and financial support as is dedicated to the horizontal axis design. The biggest vertical axis being developed in the UK is  kilowatts, which is still in the small turbine range.Dr Campobasso says the sector is not lacking in imagination, with a team in Turkey working on a tower with oscillating wings aimed at mimicking the aerodynamics of the hummingbird ndash the only bird capable of hovering like a helicopter. But once again challenges with the wind dynamics and flow will have to be overcome. Tethered turbinesabove the ground also face issues.ldquoOne of these is upscaling, as the prototypes have been constructed at a relatively small scale. They may be fine for generating a few kilowatts, butwe are talking about wind farms with each turbine requiring to generate megawatts, then the route from that prototype is quite long.Another dficulty of this model is installing a weighty electrical generator on the floating turbine and then getting the power to the ground via a cable. ldquoThe Massachusetts Institute of Technologyis looking at this and potentially it is doable, but it requires investment. All this, he concedes, means that we are probably going to be looking at conventional and controversial horizontal rotors on onshore wind farms for at least another decade.ldquoHowever, potentially we will be able to develop turbines that present an interesting visual alternative to the existing ones. It will depend ultimately on the amount of resource industry and governments devote to this.The HeraldrsquosClimate for Changeinitiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

Personal mobility remains key to wellbeing.Newton is up for the challenge ndash is the Scottish Government We are writing to the Housing Minister to set out our ideas for changes to tenement law.Derek MacDonald is joint managing director of Newton Property Management.

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someone’s comfort and well-being.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute.

For the le of the planet no amount of money can compare to what mother nature gives us.Earth#s nemesis is our banking systems and what they represent.As the Bibles says Timothy ,  # For the Love of Money is the root of all kinds of evil #.I#d very much like to read the rest of Johan Adamson#s comment but can#t find it here.Involving children in the spread of propaganda mirrors the ways of Chairman Mao and his #cultural revolution#. It is an increasing trend in UK and one we should surely reject.So, instead we should indoctrinate them in the ways of continued, pointless consumerism that is managing to waste resources and destroy the environment  Why is this behaviour any more #normal#  These are intelligent young people who know their own minds, ones who can be bothered to get up and make their voices heard.I didn#t advocate consumerism though. Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.IFLAS is a global hub of inquiry, teaching, and dialogue on enabling the transition to more fair and sustainable societies.All that is pure Mikey Mouse to a true Scientist!!!Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#Nigel Farage will save the world.I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less.Relax kids! Theres no proof of climate crisis worldwide, says self-proclaimed “true Scientist” Ian Tinkler, yet our national climate scientic advisors think there is. Who is right  Hint, Ian hasn’t shared where he gets his reliable info.The government listens to an armsindependent body of expects established by law because it knows there is a problem. Ali, however, spies a plot con. Some of Ali’s previous alien-culture ideas have been shown to be a little further to the right than those most Tories admit to, so we can but guess where he gets them from.John and Ian have both recently had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg. They, with Ian, are strongly pro-Brexit. There is a possible common connection  cause. The far-right internationally have begun to target Greta whilst denying the dangers of global warming. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read thearticle “Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate change denial” from June th.The AfD is a extremist far-right racist party which democrats should oppose. The article ends by warning that far-right extremists are using troll armies to stir up hatred, distrust and anger.Oh and the vile culture that I object to is busy protesting outside Anderton School in Birmingham like you they are using children to push their agenda, while you hold the shield of “islamaphobia” over them to protect their bigotry from critique.I see the French far right nutters National Rally are boycotting Greta Thunberg now. It#s striking that right-wing extremists shake in their shoes when intelligent women come on the scene.I have no idea whatanything the french lot have said but I#m willing to bet they attacked the message and the adults manipulating the child, not the child being used to spread it.I see the French far-right nutters National Rally are boycotting Greta Thunberg, O my goodness, Greta is being #boycotted! Extraordinary behaviour!! Brian Smith, how can that be  What and how can you boycott ateenager  I had two of them and boycotting them! not credible, now exploiting! ask Greta,s Dad about that. Loads of Greeny points for the cult of heating doom.Whoop, whoop. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read the . Peter Hamilton, you are priceless. Keep it up please your fountains of wisdom are priceless.Although he has disparagesthree times above, Ian references their articles when it suits, albeit selectively. For example, on July th above, he excitedly reported:“The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option#”However, had he dwelt on the full article,he would have realised the actual scientists involved perceive there is an urgent problem, that their solution is partial, that it can only really help - years down the line, and that other urgent actions are required. His position is quite far from theirs.Just in case Ian misses the point, the selective misuse of other scientist’s work isn’t what real scientists do. So “a sensible, intelligent and educated option”, for Ian, might involve a refresher course to help him avoid misassumptions and  claims. That would be a “more rational course of action” than attempting to maintain his current pretensions that nothing incan be trusted and that his unsubstantiated understanding of climate science can.Further to the above, I have never #had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg.# I merely pointed out her unfortunate mental illnesses intermated that she was, perhaps mentally exploited by her dysal family and the Greens ofEurope. No wonder she suffers from #selective mutism#, that is when her ultra-green father speaks on her behalf. To claim my motive is allied to Germany’s AfD, a neo-nazi movement is a lie and slander, no more no less, so typical of your tawdry comments.Further to the above, another little porky from Peter. Peter Hamilton claims above that,# hiscurrent pretensions that nothing incan be trusted#!! What manest nonsense, it is self-evident that is a lie. Peter highlights my comments where I quote articles from theto further my views ! It is only the arty, green and ignorant socialist prejudiced types that I disparage. They are not limited to thewe have some specials on Shetland. I sure Peter knows to whom I refer. Why is the far right intent on undermining climate concern  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg’s widely reported conversation helps to shine light on the answers.Undermining collaboration between liberal democracies, whilst simultaneously weakening trust in mainstream political solutions and structures, is of course helpful to these extremists, however this can be achieved.But there is also big money at stake in continuing our current trajectory in general, and reliance on fossil fuels in particular. Ocasio-Cortez helpfully points out that ExxonMobil had internal science that “definitively pointed out that climate change was real” in the s and back then were predicting weather changes as far ahead as . She also states the fossil fuel lobby, and particularly the Koch brothers, have “essentially purchased the entire Republican Party”. I find it to be an informative and inspiring article which should be of particular use to anyone questioning whether Greta Thunberg should have a voice in the debate. To see Ian Tinkler and John Tulloch attack her barely days apart, and in such similar terms, is troubling indeed. Be they witting or unwitting tools of a broader extremist agenda, I hope they can reflect and desist.A more thorough appreciation of how Gove formed this view with regard to the information and advice provided by Professor Ian Boyd, Defra’s Chief Scientic Adviser, and his team can be found at:Both the U.K. and the Scottish Parliaments have declared there is a climate crisis, but Ian surely knows better..."},{"url":null,"title":"amaryllis takes top prize at shetland race first leg reception ","story":"The prizes for the Bergen to Lerwick leg of the Pantaenius Shetland Race were handed out at a civic reception at Mareel on Friday evening..

While many people can fondly remember hearing its call in years gone by, Rathlin is the only place in Northern Ireland where the birds have been heard in recent years.A male has been heard calling in one location on Rathlin each year since  and now RSPB NI staff have recorded two breeding males in two separate sites on the island this summer.Known for their unmistakeable ‘crex-crex’ call, corncrakes are highly secretive and like to settle in early growing tall vegetation like nettles, cow parsley and irises. One of the sites - in Church Bay - is on land owned by an islander but managed by RSPB NI that has had nettles planted by staff and teams of volunteers to encourage the birds – summer migrants from western Africa – toto Rathlin.RSPB Rathlin Island Warden Liam McFaul said: “It’s fantastic and really encouraging that the work we’re doing for corncrakes is making a dference. It’s been an exceptional year because for the first time since the s we have two calling corncrakes and this is brilliant. The birds have two broods and the second brood will be hatching in late July.”Corncrakes are rarely spotted but the Church Bay male bird has been calling during the daytime now since mid-May and has come out into the open on occasion and has even been captured on camera.Liam has a theory about why the bird is so vocal and has been spotted moving around.Liam said: “He has been calling out in two or three dferent locations and then he’s moving across the road to the other side and is calling quite a lot, all night long and quite often during the day.“Because of this behaviour, this could indicate that there could be more than one female in that area and he’s tending to two areas at once. But because the females are silent, we don’t really know.”The second male corncrake has been recorded on private land owned by wildle-friendly farmer Richard Green and his family on the western end of Rathlin.Liam McFaul believes theof a sustainable corncrake population would be a huge boost for the island.One person treated by emergency services after dramatic Lough Neagh rescue - jet ski not seen for more than two hours Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"“Hopefully we will see their numbers increase and get a sustainable population, with four or five pairs regularly breeding, and this feels more achievable after this landmark year. Each breeding pair can produce up to  eggs each breeding season, although there is a high mortality rate with these birds. Increasing corncrake numbers could be a big tourism benefit for Rathlin. People travel to Tory Island in Donegal just because of the corncrakes there,“ he said.Liam said that RSPB volunteers have played their part in this conservation success story on Rathlin. “We’ve been creating areas of early cover over the last  years or so. This has involved teams of volunteers on the mainland over the winter digging up nettle rhizomes because that’s ideal habitat for corncrakes. If you plant them they grow early in the season and that encourages the birds to come in.“I’m sure some volunteers will spend a day digging nettles on a wintry day and think ‘What’s this all about ’ But when you stand here now on a summer’s day and think there’s a bird that’s globally threatened and you have helped to save it by just going out and digging up some nettle rhizomes, well you know most of the people involved will be absolutely delighted at the results.”Farmer Richard Green is delighted to have been hearing the corncrake’s call - on the second corncrake site - over the last few years.He said: “For me, it started four years ago when we had a corncrake calling right through the summer.“To hear that this year there are two pairs, one of which is on our land, is great. It shows us we must be doing something right for them. The way we farm, we’re sensitive to nature and the birds and we try to do whatever we can to help.”After the second brood hatches later this month, the birds will migrate back to Africa in August or September.Corncrakes are easily spooked, so members of the public are asked not to try and get close to the birdsthey hear their call as they are on private land and it is also important that the birds are not disturbed and that this sensitive conservation effort is not compromised.try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1985871.jpg--.jpg?1563356127000\n","title":"council to honour ww2 veterans with silver poppy gift","story":"WHILE urging Mid  East Antrim Council to honour the last surviving veterans of World War , DUP councillor John Carson reflected on the cost of that global conflict to one local family.Proposing a motion that each surviving veteran in the area - from across the services and the merchant navy - should receive a silver Poppy of Remembrance in November, Alderman Carson said it was also fitting to remember those who had made the supreme sacrice especially with the th anniversary of the outbreak of war looming.

In the last six months, two of the Wardens have also voluntarily piloted twilight shts to enable them to attend local community meetings and events including the PCSP PSNI business crime prevention advice workshops, Dromore CPLC, etc. This has enabled the Wardens to build strong relationships with local community representatives and work with them to help resolve issues that are causing community concerns.Since the introduction of safety wardens in , the wardens have made a signicant contribution to reducing anti-social behaviour across the Banbridge District as well as providing reassurance to local communities and to those enjoying the night time social economy in Banbridge town centre. The presence of the wardens is widely recognised as having the positive impact of dfusing potentially dangerous situations and preventing them from escalating thus reducing incidents of violent assault or criminal damage.Banbridge PCSP had been lobbying the Department of Justice recently to re-consider its decision and to continue to provide additional funding for the Banbridge District Community Safety Wardens scheme to at least March , .

Following its refurbishment, the church has become a hive of community activity and will welcome former Clannad musician Moya Brennan for a highly anticipated concert on August .The County Donegal performer has just released a new album, Timeless, and will play a number of shows throughout the country in the coming months, but luckily she was able to be booked for the Greater New Lodge Community Festival through a mutual interest with Abundant Grace Pastor Sharon Perry.“I serve on the board of a Christian charity with Moya Brennan and I happened to ask hershe would be available,” Sharon explained.“She wasn’t free the night we were supposed to be having it, so we change the date and she was very willing to come along.“It’s a great opportunity for the local community to see such a well-known performer. I think it’s something that doesn’t come along often so close to home. You might see an advert for one of the concert halls in Belfast for Moya, but to have it on our own doorstep here is brilliant. Moya is a lovely lady with a beautul ministry of music.”As well as providing a fantastic night of entertainment, all proceeds from the concert will go to to Special Olympics Ireland.“We ourselves as a charity try to make ends meet to get the work done that is in our hearts to do,” Sharon stated.“We try to help other charities where we can, so we thought this was an opportunity to help kids with learning disabilities. There are lots of activities there for them to be stimulated through sport.”Looking forward to the gig, Sharon said: “We have Zephaniah Dancers coming as well, who are an Irish dance group based in Portadown. They’ll be the support act. The strange thing is that they’re really excited about coming as well because they have actually choreographed a dance to one of Moya’s songs and had got permission to perform it in dferent places. The fact that the girls are now coming together with Moya is amazing.“There will be a mixture of secular music, Gaelic songs and a few Christian songs in the mix as well.”She continued: “I hope people take the opportunity because the chance doesn’t come along often to see Moya Brennan for £. We know that people will come from where, and we welcome that as well, but we would really love the local community to come along and at £ most people can manage that.

At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead. In short, we need a statesman, not a showman.“Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefiting. With an impending no-deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.“To date he has failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario # needs that require more than merely a can-do attitude to resolve.“The Irish border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreementmishandled. It is also impacting on the ability of parties to restore the political institutions here. He now needs to demonstrate his ability to act with sensitivity and impartiality in his engagements with local parties.“It#s time to cut the bluff, bluster and bombastic rhetoric and start to provide the kind of reassurance business and civic society needs. Whilst I remain sceptical he will do that, I wish him well and will be more than happy to be proved wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi.

The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face.

The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals. Even burning his hand while working on his car failed to dampen Tonerrsquos day.Camillus Bradley and Crawford Henderson claimed second in the category after early second-placed holder Wesley Patterson went out with a broken crown wheel and pinion.Round five of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Rally Championship will see a switch from tarmac to gravel as crews head to Co Fermanagh in September for the Lakeland Stages Rally.The series is beginning to heat up and a three-way fight for the crown is developing between Derek McGeehan, Derek McGarrity and Stephen Wright.

A minute later, Stuart Martin, who had been heavily watched all afternoon, flashed over a super score and followed it up with another.Not to be outdone Derry star Mullan found the space to register his fourth point of the evening.The introduction of Ciaran Watson, Michael McKey and Padraig Doran saw a fresh approach as the visitors started to claw their way back into this thrilling encounter.In the th minute Conor McCrickard plundered a second goal for his side and when Stuart Martin pointed two minutes later, Down were just a score away from levelling the contest.Richie Mullan gave the home side a four-point advantage with a brilliantly angled free out near the sideline.The outcome of the game turned when McAlornan blocked Mullan shot for goal.Derry only managed to score two more points in the remaining five minutes as an inspired Down side levelled the contest for the first time with a m Costello point.With referee Aidan Ferguson indicating there was to be four minutes of extra time, it was game on. Eoghan Cassidy edged the home side in front with a super effort from out on the left wing, only to see McCrickard level once more from a similar type angled dead ball score.Derry had spurned an opportunity of snatching the game when the Down rearguard pressurised Seaacuten Kelly into shooting wide.Fom the resulting puck-out a tussle for possession saw Niall Fitzsimmons flash the sliotar over the Derry crossbar.When the whistle finally blew five minutes over the , it was Down who had progressed to Semple Stadium.Down: C McAlornan, E Kelly, T Murray, A Dorrian, C Smith, R McCrickard, N McFarlane , N Fitzsimmons , P Savage, J Hanrahan, R Blair , T Prenter , R Costello , C McCrickard , S Martin .

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years. Among the Northern Ireland firms making the last in previous years include First Derivatives and Novosco. A total of  firms from Northern Ireland made the list last year, with Belfast-based Repstor the highest-ranking Northern Ireland business at number  in the rankings. Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
