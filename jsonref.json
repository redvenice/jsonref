Talks between House Democrats and Republicans stalled yesterday over a stopgap spending bill that would temporarily extend the current level of government funding.  Another potential stalemate popped up on Wednesday when a group of House Republicans encouraged their colleagues in the Senate to use the potential shutdown as a bargaining chip. They are encouraging Senate Republicans to block the stopgap measure unless Democrats agree not to direct money toward enforcing the federal vaccine mandate for large companies.

Merkel, who met Germany’s 16 state leaders on Thursday with her successor, Olaf Scholz, for emergency talks on tougher measures to stem rocketing Covid cases, said the situation was “very serious” and an “act of national solidarity” was required. She said Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, would first vote on the proposed vaccine mandate, with the country’s ethics council due to issue formal guidance by the end of the year, and the rule – if passed – coming into force from February. The move would follow the example of neighbouring Austria, which is planning mandatory vaccinations from February. Greece has also announced mandatory jabs for the over-60s, with unvaccinated people facing fines if they fail to comply. New daily infections in Germany have broken records in recent weeks, with many hospitals operating at or over capacity and forced to send patients elsewhere for treatment. Authorities said 73,209 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. Merkel’s outgoing government had previously ruled out mandatory vaccination, but the measure has since won broad political backing. “We don’t have enough vaccinated people,” Scholz said after the meeting. “We now know that this has consequences.” Read the full report here: Germany could make Covid vaccination mandatory, says Merkel The government is expected to accept the recommendation. The institute said the vaccinations could start as soon as Finland obtains approved shots.Germany will also impose sweeping nationwide restrictions on social contact for unvaccinated people, in what local media is describing as a “lockdown for the unvaccinated”.  Unvaccinated people will be barred from non-essential shops and events, unless they have recently recovered from Covid. “Culture and leisure nationwide will be open only to those who have been vaccinated or recovered,” Merkel said. Discos and clubs will have to shut if case numbers reach above a certain threshold, the chancellor also announced. The Covid situationwas “very serious”, Merkel warned, with cases at very high levels and vaccine take-up still lower in Germany than in many other European countries.  “We have understood that the situation is very serious and that we want to take further measures in addition to those already taken,” Merkel told a news conference. “To do this, the fourth wave must be broken and this has not yet been achieved,” she said, adding that a nationwide vaccination mandate could take effect from February 2022 after it is debated in the Bundestag and after guidance from Germany’s Ethics Council.  Austria became the first western country to make vaccines mandatory in recent days, while Greece said it would make jabs obligatory for over-60s. Merkel and her successor, Olaf Scholz, met German regional leaders today to agree a path forward for the country.

One person was confirmed positive for the Omicron variant, following a company Christmas party in the Norwegian capital. “At the moment one person is confirmed as infected with Omicron but more cases are expected,” the city said in a statement. “We are working actively with contact tracing to limit the spread and prevent bigger outbreaks.” Norway detected its first two cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant on Wednesday. The prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, is expected to hold a news conference later on Thursday.  For more on this please see 10.39am.The estimate could lend weight to preliminary information about the very high transmissibility of Omicron, above that of the Delta variant, which before Omicron was considered the most contagious of the main coronavirus variants. “Based on mathematical modelling conducted by ECDC, there are indications that Omicron could cause over half of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in the EUEEA within the next few months,” the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in a statement. There is no conclusive evidence about Omicron’s transmissibility so far but the World Health Organization’s lead person on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove, said on Wednesday the agency expected to have data on this within days. Europe has so far recorded a few dozen infections of people with the Omicron variant, which was first detected last month. The European Union and European Economic Area (EEA) include the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Earlier on Thursday, the French government’s top scientific adviser Jean-François Delfraissy said that Omicron could take Delta’s place already by the end of January. Clamor is growing among some conservatives for Republican senators to oppose a stopgap funding bill, which would fund the government for the next few weeks, unless Democrats agree to not direct money towards enforcing a vaccine mandate for larger companies in the US. If the disgruntled Republicans, who reportedly include Senator Mike Lee, from Utah, are successful, the government would effectively run out of money on Friday and could be forced to furlough workers and shut down some federal services. The need for vaccine mandates, which have been introduced by Joe Biden, has taken on additional importance as the US braces for the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant. The plot by the right comes after some Republican states have already sought to diminish mandates, by expanding unemployment benefits for employees who have been fired or quit over the requirement to get the vaccine. Read more of Adam Gabbatt’s report here: Republicans threaten government shutdown to undermine vaccine mandates The health ministry earlier this week ordered mandatory 14-day self-isolation for Ukrainians returning from those countries. Similar rules will apply to foreigners with a permanent residence permit in Ukraine. Ukraine has recorded 3.5 million coronavirus cases and 87,057 deaths. It has not registered a case of the Omicron variant yet.The man has mild symptoms and all his contacts have been quarantined, the head of Greece’s public health agency EODY, Theoklis Zaoutis, said. His contacts have tested negative so far and have been closely watched by Greek authorities, he added. As we’ve been reporting here, increasing numbers of countries are reporting cases of the variant, including in the last couple of hours India and Finland. While experts are rushing to determine the level of protection afforded by vaccines, the World Health Organization has said Omicron carries a very high global risk of causing surges of infection. *I’m grateful to reader George for flagging this to me.The variant was found in a person who had travelled to Finland from Sweden, the institute added and said it was still investigating samples from other people travelling in the same group that now were sick with Covid-19.The advert, titled “This Christmas, Nothing’s Stopping Us”, prompted more than 5,000 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which determines whether marketing campaigns have broken the UK advertising code. The ad shows the public determined to enjoy a proper Christmas with family and friends after lockdown restrictions prevented gatherings last year. However, in one scene a reporter appears on TV with “breaking news” telling viewers that “Santa could be quarantined”. Father Christmas is then shown presenting his Covid pass at border control, proving he has been vaccinated to a customs official so he can enter the country without restriction. “Having carefully assessed the 5,000 complaints we received about the Tesco Christmas ad campaign, we have concluded it doesn’t break our rules and there are no grounds for further action,” a spokesman for the ASA said.  “We consider that the depiction of Santa displaying a proof of vaccine status in an airport is likely to be seen as a humorous reference to international travel rules people have experienced this year. It is unlikely to be interpreted as a message about these rules or the Covid-19 vaccine more widely.” The scene sparked controversy on social media, attracting criticism from those in the anti-vaccination movement. The ASA received 5,009 complaints from members of the public who felt that the scene encouraged medical discrimination and the need to be vaccinated.

Both were reporting only mild symptoms and the government said that all people they had come into contact with had been traced and tested. The detection of Omicron triggered alarm in India, which suffered a devastating second wave of the virus driven by the Delta variant.  After news of the emergence of the Omicron variant broke this week, India introduced strict new rules for international travellers coming into the country, including testing on arrival and having to wait for the results before leaving the airport, and seven-day home quarantine.  In the state of Maharashtra, which was hit hard by previous waves of the virus, institutional quarantine has been mandated for travellers arriving from six countries in Africa deemed “high risk”. Plans for India to resume all commercial flights in mid-December have also now been put on hold. The Indian health ministry’s joint secretary Lav Agarwal said there was “no need to panic”. “There will be no drastic curbs any time soon. The situation is well under control,” said Dr VK Paul, chief of the government’s Covid-19 task force.Theatre-goers have not been required to wear masks but owners are moving to make them a compulsory requirement after the government’s decision to make face coverings mandatory in shops and on public transport this week. The Royal Shakespeare Company was the first to make the move, announcing on Monday that face coverings are now required at its theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, except for those under 12 years of age or who are medically exempt. Other theatres followed, with announcements from the National, which requires masks to be worn in all areas of its building on London’s South Bank, the Royal Opera House, the English National Opera and the Old Vic. Lloyd Webber’s West End theatres also moved to mandatory mask-wearing, having previously operated a policy of requesting, but not enforcing, that theatre-goers use face coverings. Theatre owners are set to keep the policy in place until at least 19 December, the date the government has set for a review of its guidance on face masks. People who are not wearing a face coverings in certain settings can potentially be fined in the form of a fixed penalty notice and ordered to pay £200. More on this story here: England’s biggest theatres make mask-wearing mandatory The United Arab Emirates and South Korea – which is already battling a worsening outbreak and record daily infections – also confirmed cases of the Omicron variant. Dr Michelle Groome of South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said there had been an “exponential increase” in infections over the past two weeks, from a weekly average of around 300 new cases per day to 1,000 last week, and most recently 3,500.  On Wednesday, South Africa recorded 8,561 cases. A week earlier, the daily tally was 1,275. “The degree of increase is worrying,” Groome said. While key questions remain about how transmissible the Omicron variant is, which has been detected in at least two dozen countries around the world, experts are rushing to determine the level of protection afforded by vaccines. World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove told a briefing that data on how contagious Omicron was should be available “within days”. The NICD said early epidemiological data showed Omicron was able to evade some immunity, but exisiting vaccines should still protect against severe disease and death. BioNTech’s chief executive, Uğur Şahin, said the vaccine it makes in a partnership with Pfizer was likely to offer strong protection against severe disease from Omicron. Read the full story here: Omicron variant fuelling ‘exponential’ rise in Covid cases, say South Africa officials “All primary contacts and secondary contacts of both the cases have been traced and are being tested,” the health ministry’s joint secretary Lav Agarwal told a news briefing. The two patients were displaying mild symptoms, officials said. India was set to restart scheduled commercial international flights on 15 December, but scrapped that plan on Wednesday amid rising concerns over Omicron and said a resumption date would be announced in due course. The government has advised states to ramp up testing, a week after the health ministry said a recent fall in testing could undermine the country’s efforts to contain the pandemic. After battling a record surge in infections and deaths in April and May, coronavirus cases have come down substantially in India, where the Delta variant – as in other parts of the world – is the dominant strain. The country reported 9,765 new cases on Thursday, taking its total to 34.61 million. Only the United States has reported more.The regional health authority said a man aged between 50 and 60, showing no symptoms of infection, had been tested on 25 November on his return from a trip to Nigeria. Subsequent sequencing identified the mutation, it said. The man’s wife, who accompanied him on the journey, has also tested positive for the virus but the sequencing that will determine if she is also infected with the variant has not yet been completed, the authority said.  A third member of the couple’s household was tested on Thursday and is awaiting the result. The health authority said none of the three had been vaccinated.

Photograph: Damien EagersPublic health officials will\u0026nbspconsider new restrictions on Thursday as part of an effort to keep Covid-19 under control over the Christmas period.Several officials said they expect the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) will discuss whether to recommend curbs at its meeting on Thursday, given ongoing high levels of infection and the still-unknown impact of the Omicron variant.It is not expected that harsh lockdown-style measures will form a part of discussions, however, with emphasis instead on curbing socialising and reducing crowding in hospitality settings.Such an approach could see capacity limits for indoor hospitality settings advised, restrictions on booking sizes and reduced opening hours, or enhanced use of the Covid cert. Advice on household visits is also likely to be considered.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told his Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting he was “sceptical” that imposing new restrictions was necessary, as the disease was tracking optimistic projections.He pointed out, however, that coronavirus cases remained at a high level and more people would be socialising around Christmas. Mr Varadkar told Nphet on Monday it should develop a contingent set of additional curbs to be deployed if the situation worsened, rather than enforcing new rules now, it is understood.Taoiseach Micheál Martin told his Fianna Fáil party that a combination of “vigilance, reduced socialisation and an accelerated booster campaign” was needed.There are concerns in political circles that harsher restrictions could be recommended by Nphet after last week’s unanticipated measures targeting children’s activities.First caseIt comes as the State confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant, with the US also recording its first incidence.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said Nphet would be meeting on Thursday to consider whether further restrictions were necessary, “mindful of Delta and the uncertainty around the Omicron variant”.“If we could see extensive use of the vaccine pass, whether mandated or voluntary, all of that would give us greater assurance in relation to protection and prevention of transmission,” he said.Nothing should be “inferred” at this stage about further recommendations from Nphet, Dr Holohan added.While cases have slowed and are stable they are at a very high number, Dr Holohan said, and this leaves the country exposed to the results of a potential increase in socialisation around Christmas, as well as the uncertainty around Omicron.Officials are expected to discuss plans to track the spread of the new variant, which are likely to be hampered by a lack of genome sequencing capacity.The National Virus Reference Laboratory had hoped to rely on information from PCR testing to identify Omicron cases. However, its director Dr Cillian de Gascun acknowledged there is a “lack of association” between the information provided by the test and Omicron cases.Only one of the first eight samples identified through PCR testing as potential Omicron cases actually turned out to involve the new variant. Current capacity only allows for 5 per cent of cases to be sequenced.There were backbench calls at both the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parliamentary party meetings for the restoration of the full rates of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which were cut this week, though no commitment on this was offered by senior Coalition figures.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"post brexit customs on packages helps revenue post 85 per cent rise in duty haul","story":"Revenue is dealing with up to 700,000 customs entries a day. File photograph: The Brexit and and an increase in online shopping in the Covid-19 pandemic have seen an “explosion” in Revenue’s activity and the customs duty haul for the State almost double to €458 million so far this year. The Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was told Revenue is dealing with up to 700,000 customs entries a day, and that it expects an a overall 30-fold increase on the 1.8 million entries it used to handle annually prior to Brexit. Fine Gael TD Jennifer Carroll MacNeill asked Revenue officials about the scale of the increase in the post-Brexit collection of duties on packages. Responding to their answers, she said the increase in the workload for Revenue was “astonishing”.Ms Carroll MacNeill also said the fees payable sometimes come as a surprise at the doorstep and added: “if you don’t mind me saying a slightly nasty surprise when people have ordered gifts”. She remarked: “The Revenue is coming into people’s lives in a day-to-day way in a way that it hadn’t been before.”Revenue chairman Niall Cody said the amount of customs duty collected up to end of November this year is €458 million – an 85 per cent increase on the €248 million collected in the same period in 2020.Ms Carroll MacNeill said the sum was “extraordinary”.Mr Cody told the PAC that Revenue used to handle 1.8 million customs entries per year before Brexit and had anticipated this would go up to about 20 million n the first year. “The reality this year we’re probably looking at a 30-fold increase,” he said.Mr Cody said he was recently told there were 350,000 customs entries in one day, at that point the highest number in one day. Mr Cody said this has since risen to 700,000 in one day. Revenue commissioner Gerry Harrahill said there were a number of factors aside from Brexit that have contributed to this “explosion”. These include an increase in online shopping due to Covid-19 restrictions and also a changing in European Union rules from July that means that items worth less than €22 are now subject to VAT, though not customs duty. He said the increased activity is not just an Irish phenomenon and is being seen across the EU in the “post-Brexit environment”.Mr Harrahill said it is a “new reality” and Revenue has done a lot of work last year and this year leading up to Black Friday to bring people’s attention to the issues that arise from importing goods from outside the EU – such liability to customs charges and VAT.Mr Cody earlier told the PAC that Brexit resulted in “a fundamentally changed trading environment between Ireland and Great Britain since 1 January 2021.”He said Revenue’s Brexit infrastructure and accommodation costs were over €9.6 million at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort for 2020, with further expenditure of over €14 million expected in 2021. He said: “Further changes to the UK government’s import requirements from January next will mean more adjustments.”Mr Cody told the PAC that Revenue will “continue to work collaboratively with trade and business, both collectively and inidually, to ensure trade flows remain as efficient as possible while meeting our Single Market and Customs Union obligations.” He said that since 2017 there has been spending of more than €120 million that is relevant to Brexit, including that on staff, information and communications technology, infrastructure, and engagement with businesses about preparations. He said Britain’s post-Brexit status as a third country has had a “significant impact on the organisation”.

Mr Martin said he had spoken to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday, who had told him that it would be the middle of the month before a full evaluation of the strain’s potency would be complete. “It will take (a further two weeks) before scientists will have a comprehensive picture in respect of how infectious it is, how virulent, and to what degree will the new variant escape vaccines,” he said. “In essence then, in the next number of weeks, we have to be cautious in respect of that variant. And its potential to do harm in addition to the Delta wave.”Mr Martin said that the overall picture in Ireland was more positive and that while case numbers were still high, they had stabilised. He said measures and a “general call to arms” announced two weeks ago – asking people to socialise less, work from home and get vaccinated – “have worked”. He said the winter season, the potential flu season and the possible impact of the Omicron variant had to be taken into account when considering how to proceed in the weeks ahead.

The Taoiseach said it was welcome to hear that 40,000 booster shots had been administered on Wednesday and that a further 10,000 to 11,000 people had come forward last week voluntarily to receive a first vaccine dose, while 10,000 others had received a second dose. Asked about the reductions to the Employment Wage Support Scheme (EWSS) , which came into effect on December 1st, and its impact on the hospitality sector in particular, Mr Martin acknowledged that some sectors were finding it “extremely difficult”. However, he said the EWSS had been an “unprecedented intervention in the economy”. He said the EWSS was economy wide but the Government would now be looking at sector specific measures that could be taken. Mr Donohoe said that more than €5 billion had been invested by the Government into the EWSS, with €440 million paid out in November alone. “While we remain absolutely committed to how we can use that program to support our economy as it is reopening safely. Equally, I have to be open and say it cannot continue indefinitely,” he said. The right point“We will have to get to a point that (it is) the right point to end employment by subsidies. It is a program of huge impact, but it was launched at a time of a risk of mass unemployment. And what we will do is review where we are…And then the Government, I’m sure very shortly, will make a decision about what is appropriate in the coming months.”Speaking in the Dáil, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said it would be “prudent” to see what Nphet’s advice would be, and its impact on people and businesses, before deciding what the Government’s response would be in terms of financial support for workers. “If it’s the case that people end up being laid off, or being made redundant over the course of the next few weeks - I’m not saying that’s going to happen - of course, we need to respond to that,” he said. “It wouldn’t be fair to say to them, some of them being laid off potentially for the second or third time, that all we have for you is the traditional jobseekers payment.”Struggling to find staffHe said some 2.4 million people were now working in the State, which was “close to more than ever before” and that many businesses he encountered were telling him that they were “struggling to find staff”. “Most of the companies that benefit from the wage subsidy scheme are not in the hospitality, arts entertainment sectors, so we have to bear that in mind too,” he said in response to Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy, who said further restrictions on hospitality would amount to “death by 1,000 cuts”. The Kildare North TD questioned whether there was now “some kind of a Darwinian survival of the fittest in terms of the businesses that can withstand” the new Covid wave. Mr Varadkar said a difficulty with the EWSS was that it “can’t be broken down on a sectoral basis”.“I think it’s important that anything we do is targeted to the workers who may be affected and the businesses and the sectors affected, not necessarily an across economy approach for sectors that may not need these financial supports anymore, which ultimately are very expensive and are at the cost of the taxpayer.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"german considers mandatory covid vaccinations as new curbs announced","story":" Outgoing German chancellor Angela Merkel and her likely successor  Olaf Scholz at a press conference in Berlin on Thursday setting out new restrictions to combat Covid-19. Photograph: Filip SingerEPAGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has said that people who are not vaccinated will be excluded from non-essential shops, cultural and recreational venues, and that parliament will consider a general vaccine mandate, as part of efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus.She made the announcement as more than 70,000 newly confirmed infections were reported in the country in a 24-hour period.Speaking after a meeting with federal and state leaders, Dr Merkel said the measures were necessary in light of concerns that hospitals in Germany could become overloaded with people suffering Covid-19 infections, which were more likely to be serious in those who had not been vaccinated.“The situation in our country is serious,” Dr Merkel told reporters in Berlin, calling the measure an “act of national solidarity”.She said officials had also agreed to require masks in schools, impose new limits on private meetings and aim for 30 million vaccinations by the end of the year.Dr Merkel also said that parliament would debate the possibility of imposing a general vaccine mandate that would come into force as early as February.About 68.7 per cent of the population in Germany is fully vaccinated, below the minimum of 75 per cent the government is aiming for.Finance minister Olaf Scholz, who is expected to be elected chancellor by a centre-left coalition next week, said on Tuesday that he backed a general vaccine mandate, but favoured letting politicians vote according to their personal conscience rather than along party lines on the matter.The rise in Covid-19 cases over the past several weeks and the arrival of the new Omicron variant have prompted warnings from scientists and doctors that medical services in the country could become overstretched in the coming weeks unless drastic action is taken.Some hospitals in the south and east of the country have already transferred patients to other parts of Germany because of a shortage of intensive care beds.Agreeing what measures to take has been complicated by Germany’s political structure – with the 16 states responsible for many of the regulations — and the ongoing transition at the federal level.Germany’s disease control agency reported 73,209 newly confirmed cases on Thursday.The Robert Koch Institute also reported 388 new deaths from Covid-19, taking the total since the start of the pandemic to 102,178. – APStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaints"},{"url":null,"title":"travellers to us must undergo covid 19 test within a day of departure","story":"Passengers travelling to the United States from Ireland and elsewhere will have to undergo testing for Covid-19 within one day of their departure under new measures to be introduced by the Biden administration. Photograph: Emmanuel CrosetAFP via Getty ImagesPassengers travelling to the United States from Ireland and elsewhere will have to undergo testing for Covid-19 within one day of their departure under new measures to be introduced by the Biden administration.The US government has said that as part of a strategy for tackling the disease this winter it will, from early next week, tighten pre-departure testing protocols which currently require all passengers to take a test within three days of travelling.It says the stricter testing timeline will provide an added degree of public health protection as scientists continue to assess the Omicron variant. The plan, announced on Thursday, will also see the existing requirement for passengers on aircraft and public transportation to wear masks continue until the middle of March. Fines for non-compliance with the mask requirement are to be increased to a minimum of $500, rising to up to $3,000 for repeat offenders. Mr Biden’s administration also held out the prospect that new Covid-19 treatments which could help prevent hospitalisation and death may be on the horizon in the winter months. It promiseed that if these are approved by regulators they will be available equally to all Americans regardless of income or location.New boostersThe plan also says the government the will seek to accelerate the development and deployment of new vaccines and boosters if they are needed to deal with the Omicron variant. It says health and medical experts believe the current vaccines authorised in the US provide at least some protection against Omicron and that boosters strengthen that protection significantly. However, it says the adminstration wants to be prepared for all scenarios and is is taking steps now to be able to quickly act if updated vaccinations or boosters are needed to respond to the Omicron variant.Apart from significant moves to improve vacaination uptake and testing in the United States, the president’s plan also involves the provision of large quantities of vaccines to poorer countries.DeliverThe plan says the United States has committed to to donating 1.2 billion doses to the world. It says it will deliver 200 million more of these in the next 100 days to poorer countries. It says these doses will be provided for free with no strings attached. It says the United States will also be the first country to negotiate a deal with manufacturer Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and Covax, the global access programme for vaccines, to send them directly to humanitarian settings and conflict zones to vaccinate displaced people. The Biden plan also commits to ramping up vaccine manufacturing capacity globally. It aims to see capacity increased by an additional one billion doses per year with production starting in the second half of next year.It also involves the provision of Covid vaccine boosters for all adults greater vaccination to protect children and keep schools open and the expansion of free at-home testing.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"many people have vested interest permanent covid emergency","story":"There is much that we have learnt about the character of modern Britain since Covid burst so disastrously on the scene almost two years ago. The only unambiguous positive is that our community spirit is alive and well, with millions ready to volunteer for the general good. We are more trusting of political and medical authorities than most other societies, and in return the British state has remained ever so slightly more liberal towards us unfortunately, our second-rate machinery of government is still scandalously unprepared for modern-day pandemics, new variants or any kind of genuine crisis.The 1940s-style bureaucracy-cum-national religion that is the NHS cannot cope, ever, regardless of how much money it is given. We are hardly the nation of freedom-lovers libertarian romantics naively assumed us to be, mostly preferring perceived security to liberty. Too many of our compatriots like to snitch on neighbours, and are pathologically incapable of rational, full-picture, long-term cost-benefit analyses. Another sorry truth: our society doesn’t properly value the education and development of children.There are several upshots to this strange blancmange of attitudes. Our vaccination rates among those aged 12 and over – 88.6 per cent have had first doses, 80.6 per cent second and 31.7 per cent third – are higher than in many other countries. This has saved many lives, and there is little prospect of the horrors of compulsory jabs as in Austria and advocated by Germany and Ursula von der Leyen. Our lockdowns, while extreme, were fortunately not as severe as those in Australia, China or France. But our ideological obsession with state delivery of healthcare and staggeringly low-grade civil service has cost many thousands of unnecessary deaths.We have also discovered something almost as damning over the past two years: it can suit many people for the country to be in a state of emergency, which also explains the politico-bureaucratic-medical establishment’s somewhat over-enthusiastic support for restrictions that will do little, if anything, to slow omicron.To be clear: I despise idiotic internet conspiracy theories, and of course the Government would love the new variant to fizzle out quickly. The pandemic has been a nightmare: it almost cost the Prime Minister his own life, has directly killed some 145,000 in the UK (before indirect effects and lockdown are accounted for) and has derailed the Tory agenda and economy. Many in Whitehall will once again be suffering from sleepless nights.Yet it is also an uncomfortable truth that, for some, there is a silver lining to the events of the past few days: delivering press conferences and being seen to act boldly is easier than politics as usual. It is helpful for the Government not to be grilled as much about MPs’ second jobs, or the fact that thousands are still crossing the Channel. The return of a sense of crisis should make the public more indulgent towards the Government’s failings. Voters may look more kindly upon the cost of living crisis and the broken promises on national insurance. The SNP and Welsh governments will also benefit.It is not just for politicians that there is an upside from the omicron-induced shift in the national agenda. It suits big companies and incompetent managers who made the most of Covid to downgrade their customer service. They used to blame Brexit now they blame omicron. It is convenient for disruptive trade unions and lazy employees on the look-out for an excuse to work less. It will embolden some to seek a hugely extended festive period working from home, regardless of the needs of employers or the extra burden imposed on colleagues. It suits the public sector, and its determination to put the interests of producers above those of consumers. Shut schools and cancelled nativity plays are a hideous, immoral blow to children, but are grist to militant unions’ mill.The worst offender, as ever, is the NHS, whose overworked doctors and nurses keep being let down by an irredeemably flawed institution. Omicron gives it cover to fail to reinstate face-to-face GP appointments, even if that means more non-Covid deaths, and to ignore its enormous backlog. Cancelled Christmas parties and holidays will make its life easier: the NHS wants us to work for it, rather than for it to serve us.Public health zealots thrive when restrictions are imposed: they like telling people what to do. Ditto some radical environmentalists. No wonder it is always easier to impose restrictions than to scrap them: plenty of vested interest groups benefit from them.The Government wants to tackle the variant by accelerating boosters, implying a belief that the current vaccines will also prevent omicron deaths and hospitalisations. But why did it take a new variant to galvanise the health service into action? Why had it been content with giving 2.5 million third jabs a week, against 4 million at the height of its rollout? Why did it dismantle its infrastructure? The Government’s management by crisis and its decision to call in the army is an easy short-term tactic to patch over the NHS’s deficiencies, and camouflages the failure to force through real change.The new scare is also helping the NHS avoid difficult questions about anti-virals. The Americans believe Covid will shortly be fully defeated thanks to apparent wonder drugs such as Pfizer’s Paxlovid. But not only do we need to purchase more doses, delivery is key: the pills need to be taken as soon as Covid becomes visible in the patient. What is the NHS’s plan to test and prescribe en masse?To Johnson’s credit, he had managed to make us more Swedish (in Covid policy terms) prior to omicron. Starting with Freedom Day, he ushered in a new British model that was hugely more liberal than that pursued by most of the developed world. Thanks to vaccinations, we learnt to live with an elevated level of infections, especially among the young, and a tolerable flu-like death toll. We should have jabbed faster, but other than that the strategy was correct: we were treating the virus as if it were endemic.Omicron is a major setback, but if it turns out to be manageable with the current vaccines, Johnson must promptly reverse all the restrictions imposed last week. Living in a permanent state of emergency makes life easier for bureaucrats and zero-risk killjoys, but it soon leads to the ruin of a nation.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Christmas party chaos as minister insists \u0026#39four or five\u0026#39 staff will be fineCovid latest news: Omicron could be responsible for \u0026#39half\u0026#39 of Europe\u0026#39s infections within monthsGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Second accuser Annie Farmer set to testify for first timeEmpowering residents to design their own streets can help solve the housing crisisTravel news latest: Holidays under threat as France, Spain and Portugal tighten restrictionsBorder guards \u0026#39beat up and deported EU interpreter after mistaking him for a migrant\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"army deployed help stranded storm arwen","story":"The Army has been called in to help those left stranded by Storm Arwen. Some have been without heating, power and water for a week, after the first named storm of the season battered the UK with 100mph winds. The north of the country was worst-hit, with fallen trees and snow cutting off entire communities.Around 19,500 homes are still without power due to the damage caused by Storm Arwen, Downing Street has said.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said a further 7,949 homes had had power restored since Wednesday - meaning 98 percent of the 950,000 homes originally affected now had electricity.We are in hourly contact with network operators to reconnect power, the spokesman said.We are working urgently to ensure welfare and shelter is provided to those households that need it.We still expect the majority of homes to have their power restored by the end of the week.Now, military personnel will be deployed in Aboyne, Alford, Banchory, Banff, Ellon, Fraserburgh, Huntly, Inverurie, Peterhead, Stonehaven, Turriff and Westhill to support the response to the storm. Conservative Member of Scottish Parliament Alex Burnett tweeted: They will check on vulnerable people in their homes and conduct door-to-door checks. Please do not hesitate to message me or email if you or someone you know needs assistance.A statement from Aberdeenshire Council said: Following a formal approach to the UK Government for assistance, around 120 military personnel will be arriving in Aberdeenshire this morning to support our ongoing resilience efforts in the aftermath of Storm Arwen.The troops will focus on welfare checks on the ground within those communities still impacted by loss of power and will supplement what our own teams have been doing since the weekend.We continue to appreciate all the wonderful examples of community assistance which continue to be evident across the region – whether it be supplies of hot food and drinks, checking on elderly residents and neighbours or helping to deliver supplies.Thank you for all your endeavours and rest assured we continue to work tirelessly to provide the support our communities require at this challenging time.A resident whose home lost power after Storm Arwen has described feeling inconsolable and scared as she faces a sixth night without central heating.Thousands of people have been left without electricity after winds reaching almost 100mph hit parts of northern England and Scotland, ripping down power lines, uprooting trees and causing debris blockages on roads.Jessica May Teasdale, 35, whose home in Stanley, County Durham, lost power on Friday evening, described the experience as a nightmare and said her region has been abandoned by the Government.Ms Teasdale, an architectural ironmonger, said: It\u0027s a nightmare... we\u0027re inconsolable and scared, are we going to get even more ill to the point where it\u0027s pneumonia?I was in tears this morning, just thinking, \u0027is it ever going to end?\u0027Our health is deteriorating each day because we\u0027re constantly in the cold.It feels like we\u0027ve been forgotten about. I mean, not to be sad but I don\u0027t even want to wake up tomorrow.Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng described the storm as unlike any other, and promised to do everything possible to restore power to homes affected before Christmas.In Parliament, Conservative Richard Holden told MPs including Mr Kwarteng that a rural surgery in his North West Durham constituency had lost £10,000 of flu vaccines when its fridges cut out.He said some remote communities have been warned it could be a very long time before their electricity supply is fully restored.Mr Kwarteng replied: Being without power until Christmas is simply unacceptable, I\u0027ll say that publicly, and I\u0027ll do everything I can to make sure that that doesn\u0027t happen.Clearly, Storm Arwen was an event the likes of which we haven\u0027t seen for certainly 60 years since the record starts.We have to be prepared for similarly extreme, difficult weather conditions in the future. We have to make sure that our system is resilient in that eventuality.He said it was unacceptable that people were left waiting up to two hours to get through to a power cut emergency phone number over the weekend.Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron said at least 7,000 homes in his Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency have been without power for between three and five nights and feel forgotten.Some have been told they will be without power for another week, and he urged the Government to send in the Army to help.Mary Kelly Foy, Labour MP for Durham City, said the power outages are a national scandal.Welfare centres and hot food have been provided, with energy network companies working with local resilience forums, emergency services, local authorities and the British Red Cross.Engineers from across the UK have been sent to the worst-affected areas.Energy minister Greg Hands visited Weardale, County Durham, on Wednesday and met Northern Powergrid engineers to thank them for their efforts.He said about 3,000 homes in the St John\u0027s Chapel area had lost power, which should be down to the few hundreds by Wednesday night.The minister was also expected to visit Northern Powergrid\u0027s Newcastle call centre, his department said.Mr Kwarteng has previously warned that weather events like Storm Arwen could become more frequent due to climate change.Be informed - via email - about the latest news stories as soon as they break. Click here to sign up to  Breaking News Alerts.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Christmas party chaos as minister insists \u0026#39four or five\u0026#39 staff will be fineCovid latest news: Omicron could be responsible for \u0026#39half\u0026#39 of Europe\u0026#39s infections within monthsGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Second accuser Annie Farmer set to testify for first timeEmpowering residents to design their own streets can help solve the housing crisisTravel news latest: Holidays under threat as France, Spain and Portugal tighten restrictionsBorder guards \u0026#39beat up and deported EU interpreter after mistaking him for a migrant\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street party dream us narrative labour seize pity","story":"Who attended Downing Street Christmas parties in 2020? It might not seem like an important question, but the accusations aired this week that Boris Johnson held several “boozy parties” for staff in the run-up to last Christmas have the potential to embarrass the Government and damage further its reputation and standing with the voters.The charge is that there were several social events for Downing Street staff in the weeks before last Christmas, attended by “several dozen” people and going on well past midnight. Few would begrudge the besieged civil servants and advisers a couple of glasses of Ecuadorian cava and a bag of crisps but after 14 December 2020, London was placed in tier 3 lockdown in response to the “Kent variant” of Covid-19, which stipulated that people should not mix indoors with others outside their households or support bubbles.The strict rules introduced just before Christmas brought despair to many. Hopes of seeing family and friends were dashed, and it felt like a huge setback to the country’s effort to control the coronavirus. No doubt there were people who flouted the regulations, but the pandemic has demonstrated that we are, on the whole, a fairly law-abiding nation, and last December, after nine months of the crisis, the necessity of the rules was clear to most people.So did these parties happen? Were rules being ignored at the very heart of Government? We have not had clear answers. The prime minister assured the House of Commons on Wednesday that all the rules were followed, and his spokesman described the accusations as something Downing Street did “not recognise”. Neither of these are the categorical denials they could be.It is reasonably safe to assume, given the failure of Downing Street to strangle this story at birth, that something happened which may have pushed the lockdown regulations to their limit and beyond. The prime minister is not accused of attending the party on 18 December, which was said to have been an unofficial Christmas celebration, but he is responsible for the operation of Downing Street and for setting the tone.This matters because it offers the opposition a chance to build a damaging narrative against the Government, that of treating Covid regulations—like many other issues—as a matter of “do as I say, not as I do”. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, accused Boris Johnson of “taking the British public for fools”, and the idea of Whitehall civil servants partying in close contact while families were kept apart across the country certainly plays to an idea of them vs us, the Government (and a governing class) against the ordinary people.Other issues feed into and support this narrative. Accusations of privileged commercial access to deal-makers in Government, the attempt to set aside the standards committee’s judgement on Owen Paterson, the failure of many Conservative MPs to wear masks in the House of Commons: all of these can be used to paint a picture of a governing elite which looks to its own interests while preaching more exacting standards to the electorate.Labour could turn this narrative into a powerful weapon against Boris Johnson. For all his chummy, cross-class appeal, he has never hidden his disdain for rules and regulations. What has previously been seen as an endearing cavalier spirit could easily curdle into a belief that he holds himself above petty considerations such as law and propriety. It is a portrait which instinctively fits, given the right reinforcement.Will Labour use this weapon, or will they fail to pull the trigger, afraid of the bang? Certainly Sir Keir Starmer lacks the rhetorical savagery or flair to cut deep into the prime minister’s reputation: he is a careful and methodical lawyer but not a QC who tears up the scenery and breathes fire.Angela Rayner has that free-swinging punch, but it was noted that her speech on standards and conduct this week was overshadowed by the way in which Starmer reshuffled his top team without telling her. Of the new figureheads, David Lammy is scrappy but sometimes overextends himself perhaps Yvette Cooper’s controlled fury will be deployed to good effect.This is a dangerous moment for Boris Johnson. He risks having much of what appeals to the public turned against him, going from cheekily reckless Jekyll to arrogantly disdainful Hyde. Maybe the moment will pass, and perhaps Labour will fumble the attack: but Downing Street needs to devise a convincing defenceMore from NewsPolitics latest news: Christmas party chaos as minister insists \u0026#39four or five\u0026#39 staff will be fineTravel news latest: Holidays under threat as France, Spain and Portugal tighten restrictionsCovid latest news: Omicron could be responsible for \u0026#39half\u0026#39 of Europe\u0026#39s infections within monthsGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Second accuser Annie Farmer set to testify for first timeEmpowering residents to design their own streets can help solve the housing crisisBorder guards \u0026#39beat up and deported EU interpreter after mistaking him for a migrant\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"educated young wealthy thousands hong kongers looking move uk","story":"Hong Kongers applying to come to Britain are younger, wealthier and more educated than those planning to remain, an Oxford University study has found.Nearly 90,000 have applied for British visas to escape Chinese rule and are expected to hit 100,000 in the New Year, equivalent to a town the size of Gillingham.The study, by Oxford University’s Migration Observatory, exposing the brain drain\u0027\u0027 from the former British colony found they were predominantly young Hong Kongers, with half born in the 1980s or 1990s.Compared to those who plan to stay in Hong Kong, potential UK movers were also more likely to have university education (33 per cent versus 22 per cent).They were more likely to be in full-time employment (60 per cent against 50 per cent) and 90 per cent had at least A-level or post-secondary education.Dr Peter William Walsh, a researcher at the Migration Observatory, said the UK’s visa scheme appeared to be more attractive to those with the funds and younger Hong Kongers with fewer ties to it.“The BN(O) route to the UK has already generated significant numbers of applications, but it’s not a particularly cheap option. For a family of three to use this route to get citizenship in the UK would take at least five years and cost about £20,000,”  he said.The system, which offers up to 5.4 million Hong Kongers a five-year visa and a path to permanent British citizenship, was opened on January 31 after China’s new security laws were introduced last year.Home Office figures show that 88,000 Hong Kongers have applied for Britain’s bespoke five year visa scheme in the 10 months since it was launched.The survey, the first major study into Hong Kong migration, found that the UK was the preferred option among those who expressed an interest in leaving the country.A third (33 per cent) placed it as  their top destination, ahead of second-place Taiwan (23 per cent), Australia (15per cent) and Canada (11 per cent). London was the most common choice of destination city, favoured by 42 per cent of potential movers and well ahead of second-place Manchester (12 per cent). The survey also found that dissatisfaction with a wide range of political, social and economic factors in Hong Kong was much higher among potential UK movers than those who planned to stay behind. More than half (52 per cent)  of potential UK movers were dissatisfied with the credibility of the police and the trustworthiness of the government (57 per cent). Half (53 per cent) were also dissatisfied with economic factors such as the cost of living in Hong Kong although 63 per cent also said they expected to face a pay cut if they moved to the UK, suggesting better wages were not a primary driver of decisions.Many also cited prospects for their children as a factor motivating a preference for the UK.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Christmas party chaos as minister insists \u0026#39four or five\u0026#39 staff will be fineGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Second accuser Annie Farmer set to testify for first timeEmpowering residents to design their own streets can help solve the housing crisisTravel news latest: Holidays under threat as France, Spain and Portugal tighten restrictionsBorder guards \u0026#39beat up and deported EU interpreter after mistaking him for a migrant\u0026#39Boris beating Labour is no foregone conclusion - it all depends on Keir StarmerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pigs hernias as big footballs","story":"Exclusive: Pigs with hernias as big as footballs in squalid farm for frankfurters sold in UKWARNING, DISTRESSING CONTENT: Footage secretly filmed in a farm supplying Frankfurter brand Herta found pigs being beaten and mutiliated - the brand is owned by Nestlé and Spanish food firm Casa Tarradellas and stocked in Asda, Iceland, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco Image: French group L and UK group Open CagesByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsPigs reared by a Frankfurter company sold in major British supermarkets are left to suffer with hernias “as big as footballs” in squalid conditions, as well as being beaten and mutilated, an investigation has found. The brand promises “higher animal welfare standards” but videos secretly filmed inside a farm which supplies Herta, reveals multiple breaches of animal welfare standards, according to L the French campaign group that obtained the footage. It shows pigs being beaten and mutilated and according to L also pumped full of antibiotics considered “last resort” by the World Health Organisation. The farm is contracted to supply Frankfurter brand Herta which is % owned by Nestlé and stocked in Asda, Iceland, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco. Spanish food firm Casa Tarradellas owns the remaining %.The footage, obtained in north-eastern France in August and September, also show animals living on concrete floors appearing to be covered with faeces, sows in cages so small they cannot turn around, and sick or injured animals with hernias that appear to be as big as footballs.The pigs in the video have had their tails docked, a practice outlawed in the EU, other than in exceptional circumstances.  No straw or other bedding is seen and the sheds do not appear to have any natural light. L say they filmed male piglets castrated without anesthetics by tearing of the tissue: a painful technique which is forbidden. Some sows in the video are also beaten, which is prohibited, while some who are pregnant were filmed in cages which do not appear to have permanent access to water, in violation of the law.  Other violations of EU regulations the group say they have uncovered include weak piglets, considered to have poor economical potential, appearing to be slammed on the floor in the footage. The group says this killing practice does not comply with the EU rules of emergency slaughter. On its website, Herta claims that their “Filiere Preference” guarantees “a modern scheme, more respectful of the environment and of animal welfare.  All our suppliers are committed beside us to improve farming conditions.” The new revelations come after Waitrose pulled all Herta products last year following another exposé revealing ‘deplorable’ conditions at a dferent French farm supplying the brand. A trial is set to take place next month after the farm was accused of animal abuse. British charity Open Cages is campaigning for the introduction of explicit animal welfare labelling, including specically pointing out imports from countries where regulations are lower than UK standards. Open Cages CEO Connor Jackson urged British supermarkets to drop Herta products from its shelves. “This is the second time that footage has revealed the depravity hiding behind Herta’s promises of high welfare” he claimed. “The deception is passed onto the British consumer who is buying meat from animals who have been beaten, tormented and pumped full of antibiotics without knowing it.” “Clearly, Herta is not committed to aposimprove farming conditionsapos as they claim. Waitrose did the right thing by dropping Herta from its shelves, and we are urging Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda to do the same immediately or risk continued support of animal cruelty.”A spokesperson for Nestlé UK and on behalf of Hertasaid: “We do not tolerate animal welfare abuses anywhere in our supply chain.The scenes shown in this video are unacceptable. We have contacted Herta to ask them to investigate this farm as a matter of urgency and take the necessary action as needed.” An Asda spokesperson said: ‘’We take animal welfare extremely seriously and as soon as we were made aware of these claims we launched an investigation with the supplier.’’ A Sainsbury’s spokesperson added: “Animal welfare is extremely important to us and we’re investigating with Herta.” Iceland declined to comment. Morrisons and Tesco did not respond.

Voters are going to the polls today in the by-election with the result expected in the early hours of Friday. The constituency was created in  and has always been won by the Tories. Former Conservative PM Ted Heath held the seat - and its predecessor, Bexley - for  years. The last time Labour won here was a  by-election.  Local councillor Mr Francis, , said the route to victory “is a dficult path”, adding: “It does rely on Tories staying at home, some Tories voting for us, Tories voting for other parties, people who might support smaller parties voting Labour. “We accept it’s a dficult path, but it is possible.” The by-election was triggered by the death from cancer of former Cabinet Minister James Brokenshire in October. Mr Francis, a dad of eight-year old twin girls, decided to launch his bid to oust the Conservatives from this South East London stronghold on the Kent border after being persuaded by we Emma, a teacher, and parents at the school gates.“Iaposm standing because I had a broad consensus of Labour Party members plus Conservative and Liberal Democrat voters at my daughters’ school gates encouraging me to stand, saying, ‘If you do, we will vote Labour’.“Those conversations made me believe I could bring together a cross-section of people who normally wouldnapost vote Labour, along with those who do vote Labour.  “Those people at the school gates have been natural Conservatives but theyaposre really not happy with what is happening with public services and believe that I was the person that could be arguing for the right direction in Parliament.” Anger at the Government ranges from the failure to tackle rising gas and food prices to Tory sleaze. “People have been talking about bread and butter issues - cost of living, high streets, policing, cuts the Conservative council has made,” said Mr Francis. “But during the course of the campaign, people’s perceptions have changed about the Prime Minister and about the sleaze that has been surrounding this Government.” While realistic about their chances of winning the seat, Labour canvassers have been buoyed by doorstep reactions. Some traditional Conservatives have volunteered they will not back the party’s candidate Louie French - blaming the Prime Minister.  Mr Francis added: “People have looked at the performance of both the main party leaders and seen who they believe is competent and in control of events and concluded that isn’t the Prime Minister, and that under Keir’s leadership they want to look at the Labour Party again and give us another chance.”Tories who defend Mr Johnson point to his electoral successes - twice winning the London mayoralty, leading the Brexit campaign and steering the Tories to their -seat majority at the  general election.But Mr Francis believes the magic has worn off - and Peppa Pig may have played a role. The PM was widely mocked for talking about the cartoon character during a speech to business leaders last month.“When Boris Johnson was the Mayor of London here, he had a very large personal vote and popular appeal,” said Mr Francis. “But one of the key issues people cite as the main reason they are defecting to Labour is the Peppa Pig speech.” He added: “The Prime Minister has clearly become unpopular here and is being cited as a liability. “I’ve had someone who was a Conservative member until last year tell me he had left the party and was voting Labour in disgust.” Labour insiders concede it will probably not be enough to beat the Tories, but they are confident of cutting the Conservative majority. Mr Francis hopes voters will flock to Labour - boosting the party’s hopes nationally. Fuelling hopes Mr Starmer’s leadership will revive Labouraposs fortunes, he cited the midpoint of Tory PM John Major’s reign, when voters were turning to Labour.  “I’ve been in the Labour Party since , I first knocked a door when John Smith was leader,” he said. “I think people are looking at us in a similar vein to that period in our history, that we are beginning a path after a period when we did have a dficult time, of moving back to the people and electability.”Asked about Jeremy Corbyn ’s ongoing influence on voters, he said: “Some people still have that period in their memories, some people feel we have moved on. “Clearly we will see what the result is on Thursday, but there will be a path that some people need a longer time to look back at that period in our history and think that we have changed. “But they are seeing on a number of issues how the party is moving on. “We are moving back to the centre ground and to where the main thrust of the British people are.” What are voters saying Voters on Bexley High Street today made clear their unease with the Tories - and some pledged their support for Labour, while others had advice for Keir Starmer.But they all expected the Conservatives to win on Thursday. Eva Seeley, , a retired estate agent, said: “I’m going to be voting Labour. I have always voted Labour and I’m not very happy with the Government at the moment - I think Boris isn’t doing a very good job.  “Keir Starmer is doing OK. He’s a bright man but he needs a bit more charisma. “I don’t think Labour will win but they might cut the majority.” Susan Berry, , a retired hospitality manager for Lehman Brothers, said: “I will stick with what I always stick with - the Conservatives. “I’m not % happy with the Conservative Party at the moment, but I won’t vote for the alternative.“Labour don’t say anything positive about what they would do - solutions instead of criticisms. “I think Boris has had a bit of a rough ride, myself.” Ashley Johnson, , a plumber, said: “I didn’t know the by-election was taking place.  “I don’t really follow politics but I know a bit about Boris - I don’t think he’s really the best. “He’s more for the rich class. For the working and middle class people, he doesnapost really help them. “I would probably vote Labour, but I would like to know more about Keir Starmer. “I reckon he should help out the people who are working class - not tax them so much, bring living costs down, rent and things like that. “That’s how to help normal people.” John Bowerman, , a pensioner, said: “I’m voting Labour, I always do - but it’s a waste of time.  “The Tories - they could put up a pig in lipstick and they would win here.” Sarah Spencer, , a finance manager, said: “I haven’t seen anything from the Lib Dems through the door - so much Conservative stuff! “If there’s a Lib Dem then definitely I’m voting for them - I’ve always been a Lib Dem supporter, I just wish there was more activity from them in the area, they need to be more vocal.  “Unfortunately, it’s a Conservative borough and has been for a long time. But I think there should be some change.” Whataposs the constituency like  Old Bexley and Sidcup is in South East London suburbia and borders Kent. The constituency was created in  and former Prime Minister Ted Heath held the seat until . It has only ever had Conservative MPs in its -year history and the closest Labour has come to winning was in  when the Tory majority was cut to just , - when Heath retired.

That appears to suggest Brits could be offered a fourth dose, given the supply would be more than enough to do so. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the buy-up will ensure we can protect even more people in the years ahead and future proof the Great British vaccination effort.And the head of Pfizer today said annual vaccinations are likely. Dr Albert Bourla told the BBC : Based on everything I have seen so far, I would say that annual vaccinations... are likely to be needed to maintain a very robust and very high level of protection. The government said the deals include  million extra doses of the Moderna vaccine and  million more Pfizer BioNTech doses. That is top of million Pfizer doses due in the second half of next year, and  million Novavax and . million GSK Sanofi doses expected in . It means the UK government has now secured early access to .million vaccine doses from six firms. The UK has still not completed its pledge to give million doses to poorer nations by mid-, including sub-Saharan Africa where the Omicron iant appeared.  Minister George Freeman defended the buy-up, telling Sky News “it’s a balance and adding: The British public would expect us to make sure we’re providing the supply in the UK. But Prof Andrew Pollard of the Oxford Vaccine Group said: As we approach the moment when  billion doses of COVID- vaccines will have been administered worldwide, it is scandalous that such a small proportion have been administered in low-income countries. Pfizer boss Dr Bourla also backed the idea of vaccinating children aged  to , telling the BBC: Covid in schools is thriving. This is disturbing, signicantly, the educational system, and there are kids that will have severe symptoms. So there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it. Boris Johnson has imposed new restrictions to buy time for scientists to establish whether the Omicron iant is able to evade existing vaccines.The strain, which was first detected in South Africa and has spread to the UK and a number of countries, is believed to be more infectious than the dominant Delta iant. Masks are now mandatory again in shops and on public transport, with all international arrivals told to take a PCR test and isolate until they get a negative results. Contacts of Omicron cases will be forced to isolate for  days - regardless of their vaccination status. All eligible adults in the UK will also be offered a booster jab by the end of January to boost immunity levels, the PM has pledged.But Mr Johnsonaposs new target - which also sees the minimum gap from second dose to booster slashed to three months - will force NHS chiefs to signicantly speed up the programme.Roughly . million people have had a second dose so far, while .million have had a booster. This leaves some . million people in need of a booster by the end of January. Mr Javid said: Thanks to the Vaccines Taskforce, we have an excellent track record of securing the vaccines the country needs to keep this virus at bay. “These new deals will future proof the Great British vaccination effort – which has so far delivered more than  million first, second and booster jabs across the UK – and will ensure we can protect even more people in the years ahead. “This is a national mission and our best weapon to deal with this virus and its iants is to get jabs in arms – so when you are called forward, get the jab and get boosted.” People are being urged to wait until they are contacted to get their booster as the NHS calls in the army and volunteers to speed up the rollout. Previously only the over-s and people with certain health conditions were being offered a third dose - but the rollout has now been expanded to all over-s. The priority list will move down in five-year age bands. NHS England is due to write to vaccination centres to ask them to invite all over-s by December , according to The Times. The Prime Minister, , is expected to get his own booster jab on Thursday. Labour leader Keir Starmer, , is expected to receive his booster jab next week.His spokesman said the party chief has also been using lateral flow tests multiple times a week. The orders come on top of the  million additional Pfizer doses ordered in August for delivery in the second half of next year, and the  million Novavax and . million GSK Sanofi doses expected in .

Heres what the guidance says, and what MPs have added on topBoris Johnson switching on the Christmas lights in Downing Street Image: Tayfun Salci ZUMA Press Wire REX ShutterstockByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Dec | commentsYet again, you’d be forgiven for being confused about Covid rules. With the Omicron iant on the rise, the government imposed new laws on face masks and travel testing in England. But that then triggered a wave of ‘freelancing’ advice from ministers and a top official that wasn’t government policy. No has been forced to deny the Cabinet are at loggerheads amid the flurry of conflicting comments.Officially, the government’s Covid advice in England is as follows.It’s a legal requirement to wear a face maskin shops, public transport, banks and hair salons. It’s also a legal requirement for all arrivals in the UK to get a Day  PCR test and isolate until it is negative. And it’s a legal requirement to isolate for  daysyou’re a close contact of a suspected Omicron case - evenyou’re vaccinated. However, it’s not a legal requirement to cut down on gatherings or close contact, work from home, or reduce travel. Masks also aren’t a legal requirement in hospitality venues. Guidance - which is voluntary - “strongly recommends” that people wear a mask “in crowded and enclosed spaces, where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.” Guidance also says people “may wish to take a rapid lateral flow test” for Covid in certain situations. These include on days when they’ll be “spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces, or before visiting people who are at higher risk of severe illnessthey get COVID-.” So with that out the way, what on earth have Tory ministers - and an advisor to the government - been saying  We take you through it.‘Don’t snog under the mistletoe, much’ Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said Brits should refrain from smooching strangers at Christmas. I donapost think there should be much snogging under the mistletoe,” the Work and Pensions Secretary told ITVaposs Robert Peston. Donapost need to do things like that. But I think we should all be trying to enjoy the Christmas ahead of us and thataposs why weaposre working so hard to get the deployment of as many vaccines as possible, and of course continuing to encourage people who havenapost been vaccinated at all yet, to come forward, recognising that weaposre still trying to understand the impact of Omicron.” Askedthere should be “just no snogging ”, she replied: Well, not with people you donapost already know! No said of Ms Coffey’s comments: “It is down to iniduals to use their personal judgement”. ‘Companies may cancel big Christmas parties’ Science Minister George Freeman turned into Mr Freelance when he appeared to contradict his own boss and No. He said: “For many small businesses, four or five staff working together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isn’t a big step up in risk. “But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people around the world to a big party. “And they may decide this year ‘is that sensible ’, given the pandemic and given where we are.” Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman responded: “On Christmas parties, we don’t want people to cancel such events.“There is no government guidance to that end.  “It’s right that post Step Four weto the position were people can use their inidual judgement.” Meanwhile Mr Freeman said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would not be having a “big” festive bash. But his words came weeks after the Secretary of State Kwasi Kwarteng said a party was already booked. A Business Department source said “dferent teams do dferent things” and no single party for BEIS had been planned.‘Maybe take a lateral flow test, I might wear a mask’ Health Secretary Sajid Javid tracked close to the official guidance - but that only went to show how vague it is.He said there wasn’t “any need to change” Covid rules, but said he’d take a lateral flow test before going to a Christmas party. If you are invited to a Christmas party, thereaposs quite a few people there, maybe you want to take an LFT before you go,” he said. Go to the party, but just be cautious. Askedhe’d wear a mask at the party he replied: “Maybe. “It dependsI’m walking around or sitting down - it depends. If I’m eating. People just need to make a decision based on the guidance.” Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister, urging people to “follow the existing guidance and be sensible about that.” The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: I think he was very clear about what he was saying. He was setting out that we do have a signicant testing capacity, andpeople wanted further reassurance they could use that.‘Go to nativity plays - but obviously wear a mask’Care Minister Gillian Keegan encouraged parents to attend school events - but added they should “obviously” follow non-mandatory guidance. Asked about nativity plays, she replied: “I think we’ve said go about your plans. “I mean, obviously wear a mask, be cautious, you know, all the things that people usually put in place, to be honest. “I think most people have been sensible all along, but we’re not saying to people cancel your plans and I’m sure it would be lovely to go to a nativity play right now.” AskedChristmas would be “ruined”, Ms Keegan replied: “Hopefully not”.‘Try not socialising when you don’t need to’Dr Jenny Harries is the odd one out in this list as she’s a non-political scientic advisor to the government, not a Tory minister. But the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agencytriggered the whole row earlier this week with her comments. She said working from home could be a “key” element of controlling a possible surge in future - despite No resisting the measure. She also said “not socialising when we donapost particularly need to” over Christmas could keep the virus at bay. She told the BBC : Weaposve seen that not everybody has gone back to work and Iaposd like to think of it more in a general way.Which iswe all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the iant at bay. So I think being careful, not socialising when we donapost particularly need to and particularly going and getting those booster jabs which, of course, people will now be able to have at a three-month interval from their primary course. Boris Johnson directly rejected the advice, adding: “On Christmas parties and nativity plays, we don’t want people to cancel such events.”‘We’re not in Plan B yet and don’t cancel anything’Lastly we come to Boris Johnson, who despite enacting mask laws has insisted we’re still not in his Plan B for winter. He has insisted people should not cancel anything and only need to follow the guidance. Despite saying “what Jenny’s saying there is right”, he directly rejected her advice. Askedhe agreed with her he said: “The answer is no.” The PM added: “We’re not going to change the overall guidance, we don’t think that’s necessary. We don’t see anything to suggest that we need to go for instance to Plan B, but what we do need to do is take particular precautions against Omicron until we’ve worked out exactly what kind of a threat it may present.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonCabinetBBCConservative PartyPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Amid the fall-out of The Mirroraposs exclusive story, she asked whether the Cabinet Secretary had been aware of the gatherings that were taking place. Ms Rayner wanted to knowhe would be conducting an internal investigation into the use of Government property for the parties and the role played by Boris Johnson and his officials. The Labour deputy leader wrote: You will no doubt understand the seriousness of the allegations made. This Government is undermining public health messaging with their actions and we cannot let this go on unchecked. It cannot be that the Prime Minister believes there to be a set of rules for the public and a totally dferent set of rules for himself. Mr Johnson and his Downing Street staff have been accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at Number  in the run-up to last Christmas. The Prime Minister gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a top aide last November when the country was in the grip of its second lockdown. Then just days before Christmas, with London in tier  restrictions, members of his top team held their own festive bash in Downing Street. It is alleged that officials knocked back glasses of wine during a yuletide quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home. The following day the PM aposcancelledapos Christmas for millions of people across the country.Mr Johnson refused three times to deny that the boozy parties had taken place when pressed at PMQs.  No  has claimed that Covid rules were followed at all times. But a Downing Street insider claimed there were often evening get-togethers while millions of people were observing the strict curbs imposed by the PM. The source said: “It was the only place you could get together and socialise. They happened most Fridays.” The Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice group slammed the PM, who faced demands to apologise for what appears to be a clear breach of his own rules. Member Safiah Ngah lost her father Zahari, , to the virus in February. The -year-old said: “Last Christmas is sadly one I will never forget. “One in  people in my borough had Covid- and my family were desperately trying to do what we could to keep each other safe. Unfortunately it wasn’t enough. To think that just a few miles away, Boris Johnson was throwing a ‘Christmas party’, with no care for the rules he had set, is sickening.“In September, he looked bereaved families in the eye and told them he had done ‘everything he could to keep their loved ones safe’. How exactly did breaking the rules himself fit into that  “While he was enjoying an illegal Christmas party, the people he should have been protecting were dying all around the country.” “The first thing the Prime Minister must do is acknowledge the hurt this has caused, and apologise.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour Partypolitan PolicePoliticsCoronavirusBoris Johnson\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We were at the theatre, to see a show my son had been learning about at school, a super special early Christmas treat.Behind us were five women in their thirties who, from the off, talked, and not even in stage ­whispers only during the big musical numbers. They chatted at the top of their voices throughout, as though they were at home in front of the telly rather than surrounded by people, and being incredibly rude to the performers on stage a few feet away. Half-way through the second act, I snapped. Although that makes it sound much more impressive than it was, because obviously I just meekly and incredibly Britishly pleaded with them to be quiet. Please. Thank you. Sorry. It did not go well. I was stupid for trying. What did I think they were going to say, “We had no idea we were disturbing you, please accept our apologies ”  Of course not. They knew they were being loud. They didn’t care. It reminded me of whenever I’ve seen anybody ask someone to wear a mask. The last time, it ended with the personanswering the polite, reasonable request with, “You f***king bitch, mind your own business”.The irony of saying that about a global pandemic – by definition, everyone’s business – seemingly lost here.Now there’s a potentially serious new iant, so we’re being asked to do something. The something that a worldwide study found to be the single most effective public health measure at tackling Covid. Wear a mask.  The reaction to this small ask, and my uncomfortable theatre experience, has left me with a depressing realisation. We’re not living in a Me First society. We’re living in a Me Me Me Me First society. This was impossible to ignore thanks to the amount of maskless people going about their business on Monday – in shops, on public transport , everywhere. They knew the mandate was coming into effect the following day, and why, but still they refused to take part in the communal effort to save Christmas – and, you know, lives – until there was no other option. Admittedly the messaging has been insane over the last few months. There will be some who think you must not need to wear a maskthe man with the most important job in the UK doesn’t. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. But there are others who know this isn’t the case, but don’t want to wear masks, so they just… don’t. Similar to the kind of person who feels like chatting loudly in a theatre, so just… does. Apart from no one diespeople talk in a theatre. The truth is that there are a lot of utterly selfish iniduals out there. We see it on a larger scale with rich countries not doing enough to supply vaccines to poorer ones because they’re too worried about themselves. And what gets lost is that helping them is the best thing we can dowe’re worried about ourselves, becauseeveryone’s vaccinated, spread is reduced and iants less likely to develop. We all need to look out for each other, with masks, with sharing vaccines, with compassion. Only then is there hope for us all.

The pharmaceutical giant’s chief executive Dr Albert Bourla said the virus is “thriving” in schools and “there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it”. It comes as the UK’s vaccine watchdog prepares official advice on whether to offer jabs to kids aged  to . Currently those aged  and over are offered it. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationsaid this week: “No vaccine is currently authorised in the UK for use in children aged  to  years. “JCVI will continue to review data on the potential benefits and risks of vaccination of children aged  to  years and will issue separate advice in due course.” JCVI member Prof Adam Finn warned the “balance” of whether to vaccinate kids was “still quite uncertain”. He told BBC Breakfast the main benefit of immunising children is the indirect protection of adults.He added: The extent to which we can do that and protect adults by avoiding them being infected by children with the current vaccines is still quite uncertain. So, thataposs the balance - we clearly want to protect children as much as possible and weaposve got good evidence now that this vaccine, even at a low dose, produces a really good protective immune response in children and produces many fewer side effects because of the lower dose. The question really is that should that be our focus right now. “Or should we really be focusing on adults who are the ones that much more commonly get seriously ill.  The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved the Pfizer jab for younger children. The boss of Pfizer said immunising that age group in the UK and Europe would be a good idea. Covid in schools is thriving, he said. This is disturbing, signicantly, the educational system, and there are kids that will have severe symptoms.” No said it would wait for the scientists to make a recommendation. It comes as Brits look set to get a fourth dose of the Covid vaccine after the UK signed deals for  million additional jab doses lasting up to .Health Secretary Sajid Javid has confirmed deals for extra doses of Pfizer and Moderna have been accelerated in light of fears over the new Omicron iant.The new deals for  and  include access to modied vaccinesexisting jabs are found to be less effective against the worrying new strain. That appears to suggest Brits could be offered a fourth dose, given the supply would be more than enough to do so. It is not yet clear whether the vaccines will need to be tweaked every year for new iants, as happens with the annual flu jab. Pfizer boss Dr Bourla said he believed Covid vaccination will become an annual event.

Minister George Freeman weighed in after the French President privately hit out at the straw-haired Prime Minster and his “Johnson circus”. According to the magazine Le Canard Enchaine, Mr Macron claimed his counterpart had “the attitude of a vulgarian”. He said: “BoJo talks to me at full speed, everything is going fine, we have discussions like big people, and then he gives us a hard time before or afterwards in an inelegant way. “It’s always the same circus.” Mr Macron is reported to have added: “It is sad to see a major country with which we could do huge numbers of things, led by a clown.”  Science minister Mr Freeman told Sky News: “I think we’re into pantomime season aren’t we, and there’s a French election coming. “It’s a pretty unhelpful word. “Of course the Prime Minister isn’t a clown, he’s the elected Prime Minister of this country with a very big mandate, leading this country through the pandemic.” He insisted: “I’m confident Anglo-French relations are better than that quote suggests.” Downing Street has not commented on the comments, which have not been officially confirmed by the Elysee Palace. But last night a UK government source suggested things will only improve after the French Presidential election in April - which could oust Mr Macron. The source said: The Prime Minister continues to be a staunch advocate for the strength of the UK-French relationship.“Our approach will not change, evenwe have to wait until the other side of the French Presidential election for a change of tone.”Relations between London and Paris have been in the deep freezefor months over post-Brexitfishing rightsand Channel crossings. The situation worsened after Mr Johnson published onTwittera letter he had written to the French leader, demanding action to crackdown on illegal Channel crossings.On Wednesday night a Cabinet minister said she was surprised and disappointed at reports of the French President’s words.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told ITV ’s Peston: “I’m surprised to hear that. “I’m conscious that we have a shared mission in trying to make sure that the people smuggling gangs are really brought to justice.” When it was put to her that the development was troubling, Ms Coffey added: As I say, Iaposm surprised to hear that and disappointed, openly. Iaposm sure that we can continue to try and work together to tackle this. “But the Prime Minister wrote to the President last week and... I hope that weaposll get a formal response back. People smugglers, they donapost carepeople live or die. They just want their money. And weaposve got to try and work this through, not only between our two shores, but actually tackling this in the first place. And Iaposve got confidence that Priti [Patel] is trying to make those inroads right across not just Europe, but also in our more international communications as well.

Downing Street did not rule out bringing back pre-travel tests before the end of the year as the Government monitors the spread of the new Omicron iant. Boris Johnson has announced a package of new Covid measures to buy time for scientists who are racing to understand the threat of the new strain.Since am on Tuesday, all internationals arrivals are required to take a PCR test and isolate until they get their result. But a leaked paper from the Governmentaposs SAGE advisors said pre-departure tests would be valuable, adding that the current plan would identy signicantly fewer cases thanpeople were asked to take tests on day  or .  Askedpre-departure tests were on the agenda, Science Minister George Freeman told the Today programme: Weaposre looking at all the data and Omicron is, weaposre literally live work every day on looking at the data, both internationally and domestically. He added: We are watching the data very closely and we will update the guidance as required. Asked to rule out bringing in pre-departure tests before Christmas, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: “I think what I can say is at the moment we have this three week review point… we believe restrictions we’ve put in place … strike the right balance between protecting lives and livelihoods. There are no plans to introduce pre-departure tests, we think the Day  test is the right way.  The spokesman added: It’s not a restriction we’re planning to introduce based on what we currently know.But Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: It is totally unacceptable that ministers are failing to take action at the border when even their own advisors are telling them to introduce pre-departure tests.“It cannot be right that people can travel to an airport, board a busy flight, queue at busy departure gates, and travel on trains and buses in the UK, all without having taken a test. “The government must not repeat the mistakes it made earlier in the pandemic by being too slow to take action to prevent further cases of the Omicron iant entering the UK.” The Scottish and Welsh Governments have issued a joint call for ato tests on day  after people arrive back in the UK.

Adorable Harper Foy, six, has harlequin ichthyosis , which makes her skin grow  times faster than normal - meaning she has to have four showers every day to soothe it. The schoolgirl from Washington is thought to be one of only  people in the USA living with her condition - and for the first few years of her le, her parents were worried she wouldnapost ever go to school at all. However, Harperaposs mum Angie, , said so far, her brave daughter hasnapost let the condition hold her back. “There are other people with her condition that we’re aware of who are home schooled, so the fact that Harper has been able to start kindergarten this September is a miracle for us.”For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Harlequin ichthyosis causes the skin to grow  times faster than normal, making it thick, dry and severely scaly. At birth, it requires intensive care. One of the only things that can soothe her angry skin is a shower - so Harper has to spend around four hours under the water every single day. Since starting her first year of school this autumn, Harper has had to have an hour long shower before heading into class. Then at lunchtime, sheaposs picked up for a pitstop to have a second shower.When she gets home from school, she has her third shower of the day, before a final shower at bedtime.Angie said: “The showers are an inconvenience, but they are essential for Harper to be able to go about her day.  “Because her skin sheds so much, it becomes itchy and sore, so the showers alleviate a lot of that discomfort.

With her attitude, I’m sure Harper will achieve anything she puts her mind to.”Itaposs been a big year for Harper, who lives with her parents and brothers Jaxon and Sam.Sheaposs been scouted as a child model after charming an agency with her sharp sense of humour.

Due to Harper’s condition, she did not have her hair and make-up done like models usually do, but Angie says she still felt very much part of things on the day of the shoot.“Her skin and scalp are too sensitive to get her hair and make-up done, but they had music blasting and Harper was dancing around the room, said Angie. “She loves Ed Sheeran, so they were playing his music for her too. Harper loves dancing and music. I always say she is an old soul.“The commercial will come out early next year and she is so excited about seeing herself in it.”Angie says her daughter has come a long way since she was born, and is now thriving. She said: “The early days were spent doing a lot of research on her condition and hearing dferent things from doctors on what course of treatment they were going to offer next.  “It was a very scary and uncertain time for us and now, to be out the other side, feels like a dream.“Harper will always be dferent from other people and her skin will always need special care and attention, but we will cross each bridge as we get to it.“I used to worry a lot about how the world would treat a girl like Harper, with her condition.

The code phrase is part of the Ask Angela campaign aimed at helping people who feel unsafe, vulnerable or threatened in bars, clubs and other night time venues, Liverpool Echo reports. Anyone who feels this way, can approach bar or security staff using the special code word Angela, which indicates to staff that they require help or support.This might be in the form of calling them a taxi, reuniting them with a friend or calling security and or the police. Adam Potter has been asked the question several times since he started his job as doorman in Liverpool city centre five months ago. The -year-old said every night at work he is approached by women who ask him to keep an eye on men who are making them feel uncomfortable on the dancefloor. And when Adam has been asked by women is Angela in tonight , he says he has stepped in to help.  Adam told the Liverpool Echo: They basically say aposcan you keep an eye on this guy heaposs making me feel uncomfortable apos I probably get that at least once a night, possibly three or four times a night - thataposs just girls who come up to me. They might say aposheaposs tapped me on the bottomapos, in which case he gets thrown out. Any touching inappropriately they get thrown out immediately. Adam has spoken out in the hope of raising awareness of the Ask Angela campaign and encouraging other bar staff to learn about the initiative. It comes after a post was shared widely on social media about the importance of the campaign in keeping people safe on nights out. Adam said: What happens is,a girl comes up to you and says aposIs Angela in tonight apos you know exactly what she means. What you then do is say aposyes apossheaposs in tonight just come with me.apos You take her behind the bar into the staff area and phone for a taxi. In more extreme cases, bar staff might have to call the police or security. Adam said: I went into this job basically just to help people and I do my very best but when I hear about girls constantly being harassed and not being as safe as they used to be going out it makes me feel upset.

Alicia Murphy, , and her husband, Guy, moved into their home in West Derby, Liverpool, in September  with their rescue dog, Otis, after thinking the property ladder was out of reach for them.It wasnapost until the pair spoke to a mortgage adviser that they realised they could be eligible for a % deposit option, Liverpool Echo reported.Alicia, who is from Liverpool originally said: I loved that it had character in the form of period features, I loved the location and it was pretty much a clean slate decor wise, which meant we could put our own spin on it. I think it had been a rental property before the owner decided to sell it on, so it was very much beige walls, light floors, etc. The couple paid just under £, for the home with a £, deposit and said their monthly cost of living was around £ including their mortgage and bills. Once they moved in to the property Alicia began experimenting with dferent colours and decoration options to make everything their own aposoriginal styleapos. But the -year-old admitted she didnapost have an initial vision for the property. She said: Originally we’d only planned to paint the walls green and have a green sofa, and it wasn’t until we moved in and I started experimenting with decorating, colour schemes and interior styles that I realised I totally loved everything ‘maximalist’ and quirky. Social media has been amazing for providing inspiration and ideas. Instagram is one of the main s I use - not only can you see other people’s amazing homes and styling, but you can also follow along with tutorials and DIYs and actually try them out for yourself. I also use Pinterest a lot.Six months after moving into the Liverpool home, Alicia set up her own blog and Instagram account to keep people updated with her progress and to share ideas with others.The Emerald Terrace Instagram now has .k followers.Alicia said: I’d wanted to start a blog for years and just wasn’t sure what my niche could be. To tell you the truth, I was never too interested in interiors before moving into this house. I set up the account about six months after moving in - a few people said I should try it because my home was that little bit dferent, and it just grew from there really! Hundreds of people comment on the Emerald Terrace Instagram updates to ask Alicia questions and compliment her home. One commenter said: You’ve NAILED the luxury hotel bathroom vibe. Another added: Forever wishing I could copy and paste your perfect perfect home for myself! Looking ahead, the couple said they expect to move on in the future but can see themselves living in West Derby for a few more years yet. The -year-old said: I think we’ll definitely move on in the future as it’d be great to have some more space, but that won’t be for a few years now. I’ve already had people jokingly tell me they’ll be the first to buy itI ever come to sell!

Shek Farsi Ahmed Shah, the restaurantaposs owner, said he believed the party was within lockdown rules because it was a wedding with  guests, Bolton Magistratesapos Court heard on Wednesday. Just a week before the wedding had taken place  people had died from Covid- across the UK in a single day.PC Andrew Hopwood from Greater Manchester Police had gone into the restaurant through an open door and found people sat down inside. Prosecutor Hamza Soren told the court: He witnessed approximately  guests present. The guests appeared to be having a sit-down meal. Decorations were on each table, there were aposMr and Mrsapos gt boxes and there were floral decorations around the restaurant. Guests were in formal attire. Females were wearing expensive-looking, traditional Asian gowns. It was clear that there was an organised, formal event taking place. The court heard that at this point PC Hopwood was approached by Shah, who confirmed he was the owner and claimed the event did not breach Covid rules. Mr Soren said:response was that he thought he was allowed  people to attend as it was a wedding.explained that by allowing guests to have a sit-down meal he had breached the restrictions. Mr Soren said the officer was then informed that there were more guests in the downstairs area of the restaurant.  Downstairs, PC Hopwood also found a wedding cake on the table, along with wedding favours and drinks bottles that had the same names on as the couple who were married. In total it was estimated there were  people present including children under , Mr Soren added. There were  staff members on duty, either cooking in the kitchen or serving food. Shah was handed a £ fixed penalty notice, while  guests were also slapped with fines. Mr Soren added: The defendantaposs behaviour was crass and irresponsible given the circumstances about the spread of Covid. He says he has admitted breaching the legislation. Despite that, for reasons known only to himself, he decided to arrange this wedding with young children and adults present. We can only speculate whether there were any infections as a result of that, but the legislation applied to everyone. It was there for a reason and the actions of the defendant were inexcusable and irresponsible. Shah, of Blackburn Road, told magistrates there were a aposnumber of things that were not accurateapos in Bolton Councilaposs account of proceedings.

Elad Maor, a cardiologist at Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv, believes he may have become infected with the new iant while attending a major medical conference at the convention centre ExCeL London. The PCR London Valves  conference, which took place between  and  November, was attended by , people – some of whom were not wearing face masks. The allegations made by Mr Maor, a dad of three and an associate professor of cardiology at Tel Aviv University, raise questions about how early the B... iant was present in the UK and Europe. It comes after Dutch officials said on Tuesday that the Omicron iant was already in the Netherlands a week before South Africa reported the iant to the World Health Organisation.  The recent revelations about the iant’s existence in Europe challenge previous ideas about where and how the iant originated, and whether travel bans on southern African countries are an appropriate response to the iant.In an interview with the , Mr Maor, who is currently self-isolating in his home in Israel, said he was convinced he had become infected in the UK,“I got the Omicron in London, for sure,” he said. “That is interesting because that was  days ago in London – really, really early.” Mr Maor, who had received three doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, described arriving in London on  November and staying four nights at a hotel in Islington, north London. After a three-day meeting at ExCeL London in Newham, east London, he ed to Israel on  November. He began to experience Covid- symptoms within days and tested positive on  November. He has so far shown mild symptoms including a fever, muscle ache and a sore throat.Pictures of the medical conference taken by Mr Maor reportedly show not all attendees were wearing masks, although people were asked to show proof of vaccination before being allowed entry. The Europa Group, which organised the PCR London Valves , has confirmed it had learned on  November that a delegate had tested positive for Covid after ing to their home country. A spokesperson for the Europa Group told the : “As you may imagine, the health, safety and wellbeing of everyone who visited PCR London Valves was our number one priority. “All protocols mandated by the UK government were put in place. Anyone entering the congress centre had to present a valid health pass and were requested to wear a mask. Hydro-alcoholic gel and masks were made readily available for all participants and disposal bins for used protective equipment were provided.” Mr Maor who travelled to the conference using the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway each day, said he was “surprised” when he saw not everyone was wearing a face covering on public transport - a common sight on the London transport network.  He undertook a PCT test on  November – his second day in the UK – and again on  November – the first day of the conference – as per UK and Israeli travel rules. He flew from London via Heathrow airport at pm on  November – the final day of the conference. Upon arrival at Tel Aviv, he had a third PCR test – which also came back negative. Mr Maor said he may have also infected a -year-old colleague after flying back from London. The colleague has since tested positive for the Omicron iant. He ed to work at the Sheba Medical Centre after testing negative when ing to Israel, before developing symptoms and testing positive from a fourth PCR test.  Mr Maor was the third confirmed Omicron case in Israel, and the first in the country with no travel links to southern Africa. Neither his we – who travelled with him to London – nor their children have experienced symptoms of tested positive for Covid-.

Weaposre free to party, toke the occasional cig, sleep with whoever we want to, and nurse our hangovers with fast food and sleep. But for many young gay men, including myself, the fear surrounding HIV and Aids can be crippling - evenweaposre not exposing ourselves to potential infection. In the aposs, the Aids crisis, also known as the aposgay plagueapos, had the world in a panicked chokehold. It was seen as a stark death sentence, a self-inflicted consequence of a dirty lestyle a decade of tragedy. And while medical understanding has advanced by leaps and bounds - the stigma surrounding the virus still echoed on to younger generations.I was six years old when Section  was finally abolished in England and Wales. The notorious law, brought in during Thatcheraposs administration, prohibited schools from talking about homosexuality. But a decade later, at the ripe old age of , I still hadnapost received any form of LGBTQ+ sex education at secondary school or sixth form. I didnapost know that HIV was no longer the death sentence that it once was, or what aposundetectableapos meant, or why as a teen who hadnapost even had sex I was so afraid of it. Because I really was petried at times.  At school, youaposd regularly hear jokes about people being bummed and getting Aids - but no teacher attempted to correct the ignorance or debunk the myths. And for some reason, I couldnapost talk to anyone about my constant panic of dying - because the stigma surrounding the virus is still re, and education is still so poor.  In fact, according to sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, the most recent estimate suggests there were , people living with HIV in the UK in . Of these, around , are undiagnosed and do not know they are HIV positive. Equally alarming,  percent of people living with HIV have never shared their status with anyone outside of their healthcare workers. Now, my experience with health anxiety is nothing compared to the thousands of people living with HIV who face discrimination on a daily basis. But it highlights how strong the reverberations of the aposs crisis are - and how important it is we begin to educate children about HIV. Today is World Aids Day - but headlines surrounding Covid continue to dominate. Perhaps because Aids is still seen as a gay comeuppance that doesnapost really affect the straight world - or maybe because the stigma is so ingrained into our society itaposs impossible to smash. But we must break through. If not, history could easily repeat itself.HIV is the name of a virus. Aids is the name for a collection of illnesses caused by this virus. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. ‘Immunodeficiency’ refers to the weakening of the immune system by the virus. HIV has been passed on between humans for many decades but was only identied in the early s.AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. It is a collection of illnessescaused by a virus people pick upthat makes their immune system weak . You can’t get an AIDS diagnosis unless you’re already HIV positive. In the s and early s, most people with HIV were eventually diagnosed with AIDS. Now, thanks to modern antiretroviral treatment, very few people in the UK develop serious HIV-related illnesses. The term Aids isn’t used much by UK doctors. Instead they talk about late-stage or advanced HIV. If left untreated, infection with HIV progresses through a series of stages: from flu-like seroconversion illness, through infections associated with the symptomatic stage, leading to late-stage HIV or AIDS. If someone with HIV has a detectable viral load, they can pass on HIV through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, anal mucus and breast milk. HIV is not passed on by spitting, sneezing or coughing, nor by kissing or general social contact. HIV can’t survive for very long once itaposs outside the human body. Studies have shown that a person whoaposs on effective treatment who has an undetectable viral load canapost pass on HIV.

In the months before her diagnosis in , the -year-old had lost three stone and was so ill that she collapsed in the hospital where she was sent for clinical assessment.It followed years of unexplained symptoms, during which time her blood was taken numerous times - but she was never tested for HIV. Ahead of World AIDS Day on December , Sandra is sharing her story in the hope it can raise awareness around testing and ensure people get the vital treatment they need sooner. Despite experiencing a number of chest infections and symptoms linked with HIV - such as unexplained night sweats, weight loss, coldsores and thrush for  years - she said medics never even considered the virus. She believes that because of her age, location and not falling into a group with a high prevalence of HIV, medics overlooked the possibility that she could have the illness.  It wasnapost until July , after being sent to hospital in Harrogate that Sandra, from North Yorkshire, was finally given the answer she needed. The doctor told me that I was HIV positive, she recalled. I thought he was going to say stage four cancer. It was a relief to know what it was. By that stage her condition was so advanced that medics said she needed immediate urgent treatment at St Jamesapos University in Leeds to save her le. I was pretty far gone, I was at the stage where it was goodbye, Sandra said. They said that within  hours it would be critical. I was in hospital for the whole of August , they saved my le.  Sandra said: I donapost know whether they discarded the idea that I had it, or just didnapost think of it at all. I just hope one or two of them went home and had a couple of nightmares. If anyone had said to letaposs do an HIV test Iaposd have said yes, by all means. An earlier diagnosis would have made a huge dference. If I had stayed at home, I live on my own, trying to live with this illness I could have died. I just donapost know why I wasnapost tested. Because of the weight loss I wonderedit was cancer that was being missed. She said she hopes her experience encourages medics to ensure patients are checked for HIV. Sandra said: Iaposve lived in fear that I was going to slip through the net. Iaposm an example of what can happen, but I donapost want this to be a sob story about me. I want to show that GPs should test for everything, itaposs only a simple blood test.  Sandra, who believes she had been HIV positive for  years before it was diagnosed, is now able to manage her condition through medication - although she said the amount of tablets she takes is higher than it would beshe had been diagnosed early. I donapost feel like Iaposm fading away, which is how I felt before, she said. Recent highly acclaimed TV drama Itaposs A Sin, which tackled the emergence of the AIDS epidemic in the s, was a hard watch, Sandra said. It shows people dying from AIDS, it was like a blow to the head because to me thataposs how I was when I went into St Jamesapos. It was only then that I realised Iaposd been living with it all through  and years and years prior to it.Sandra now volunteers with HiVitality, a charity which provides retreats for people with the condition to spent time with others in the same position.There are people out there that need reaching and need help, this is something that they need, she said. Charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, which provides support for people with HIV, said that the delay in identying Sandraaposs condition shouldnapost have happened, and said she was not tested until it was nearly too late. It is campaigning for opt-out testing at AE departments - meaning blood taken from patients is tested for HIV unless they say no - a move Sandra said she agrees with. Liz Porter, clinical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: Sandra’s story is such a sad one and it absolutely shouldn’t have happened. Sandra was presenting with a lot of the indicators of undiagnosed HIV, including unexplained weight loss, coldsores and thrush, and yet no one thought to test her until it was almost too late. Sandra’s is an extreme and rare example of incredibly late diagnosis, but the latest data shows that % of people diagnosed with HIV are still being diagnosed late. Which means the diagnosis comes after damage to the immune system has already begun. This is worst in those aged  and over where a shocking % of people are diagnosed late. Too often both iniduals and health professionals don’t think of HIV affecting certain groups, for example a white woman in her s like Sandra. Ms Porter said that routine testing in Sandraaposs area could have made. a big dference and avoided the health problems she is now experiencing. She stated: Routine testing across healthcare is a clear way to avoid this happening to others, alongside educating professionals about HIV and what indicator conditions to look out for. If routine testing had been in place where Sandra lives, she would have been diagnosed years earlier with a simple test at her GP and avoided the health problems she is now experiencing. It would also have saved the NHS money and avoided Sandra’s weeks in hospital. You can live a long, healthy le with HIV thanks to treatment – but the earlier you’re diagnosed, the better.

A study of online traction by Design Bundles found that Meghan is well out in first place despite having left the royal fold last year and now lives in Calornia with Prince Harry. Meghan may even be the most influential woman in the world argued a spokesperson for Design Bundles.The data shows that, -year-old Meghan attracted . million Google searches on average each month over the past year. She has also used in . million Instagram hashtags and has had , articles written about her, reported The Express.  A spokesperson for Design Bundles said: Now, the Duchess of Sussex is likely the most talked-about and influential woman in the entire world, as well as in the Royal Family.Meghan, along with husband Prince Harry, has always rejected the royal tradition to bury one’s private opinions and present a united, idealised front to the world.Meghan’s bravery and boldness in speaking up about issues such as racism, parental leave and empowering women are unlike any other royal, and her voice is a powerful and enduring one. The Duchess of Sussex is deeply committed to alleviating world issues through her charity work, and despite no longer being a working royal, proves that her influence is positive and unchanging. Behind Meghan comes the Queen and she has triple the combined Instagram hashtags, Google searches and media mentions than the average member of The Firm. Elizabeth appeared in . million Instagram hashtags, . million Google searches per month and , articles. It shows that despite her age she remains a highly respected world figure who is leading the Royal Family through a turbulant period. The Queen is a global style icon herself, creating a popular trend with her habit of wearing exquisitely colour blocked clothes, in bright, stand-out colours, so one can always locate her in a crowd, added the Design Bundles spokesperson. Kate Middleton came out as the third most popular royal and the overall Queen of Instagram.

In the BBC documentary, The Princes and The Press, Jenny Afia said there were massive inaccuracies in the story that Meghan had bullied some of her staff.The allegations surfaced publicly in March this year and were branded a calculated smear campaign by the Sussexes, who fiercely deny any wrongdoing.On True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, royal expert Richard Kay questioned Meghanaposs lawyeraposs remarks.He said: “The thing that struck me about Jenny Afia was where she categorically said, as Meghan’s lawyer, that the allegations of bullying were untrue.  She is in no position to know that. She could have said ‘I am advised as her lawyer that the allegations are untrue’, but she wasn’t there and she doesn’t know what the nature of the investigation by Buckingham Palace is, [and] which is still ongoing into the claims and counterclaims.”During the documentary, broadcast on Monday night, Ms Afia was asked by presenter Amol Rajanthe story about bullying allegations, which first appeared in The Times, was accurate.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. She told the programme: The overall allegation was that the Duchess of Sussex is guilty of bullying. Absolutely not. The first thing is to be really clear about what bullying is. What bullying actually means is improperly using power deliberately and repeatedly to hurt someone physically or emotionally. The Duchess of Sussex has absolutely denied ever doing that. That said, she wouldnapost want to negate anyoneaposs personal experience. When askedshe provided any evidence to refute the claims, the lawyer added: It is really hard to prove a negative. Soyou havenapost bullied someone how do you prove you havenapost.  Just denying the allegation... doesnapost address the underlying problem that the allegation has been made.The documentary, which aired its first part last week, set out to explore the relationships between Princes William and Harry and the press.In the first episode last week, there were claims that negative stories about Meghan were leaked by courtiers and there was competitiveness between William and Harry’s respective households. In a joint statement that was shown at the end of the documentary both this week and last week, Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace and Clarence House said: “A free, responsible and open Press is of vital importance to healthy democracy. “However, too often overblown and unfounded claims from unknown sources are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.”The Royal Beat - available on True Royalty TV.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryPrince WilliamMeghan MarkleRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

After previously confirming over the phone that they would accommodate her upon her arrival, when she got there, a member of hotel staff told her they could not help. At am on Saturday, November , Laura received a distressed call from her daughter, whose trip to visit Plymouth had quickly become a desperate situation of searching for a place of safety in an unfamiliar city.“We live down in West Sussex so we are too far away to pop into a car and help her out, Laura told PlymouthLive.“I had phoned the Jurys Inn and explained I needed to get her a room and I would like to arrange and pay for that over the phone. “The person on the front desk said they are having IT issues and that the system was down butshe could get to the hotel, they would sort it out when she got there. “She got to the point where she had no choice but to walk to the hotel, in a city she didnapost know, in a very scared and vulnerable state.  “She got to the hotel and was then told ‘well I told your mother we have an IT issue’ and told her to go to the Crowne Plaza, which was a twenty-five minute walk away. Living over a five-hour drive away, Laura did everything she could to help her daughter by calling taxi companies and contacting other hotels to no avail. “I then saw there was a train at :am, said Laura, so I then directed her towards the train station and got her on a train where she would be semi-safe.” Laura wants to highlight what happened to her daughter in Plymouth last month so more can be done by people and businesses to recognise when a young woman needs a place of safety. The distressed mum wants to see changes made in the future to avoid this sort of situation happening again. “It’s not acceptable whataposs happened, she said. Iaposll strongly fight for the fact that this is wrong and the next girl in that situation needs to be recognised. It’s common sense. “People need to be aware of the safety of young women, even more so at this time, not that it should ever have to be like that, but it obviously is. “It’s not even that people need to be extra vigilant, it’s having common sense. A Jurys Inn’s spokesperson said: “The welfare of guests and the general public is of the utmost importance to us. We are looking into what occurred on the morning in question.” Laura said she found it “distressing” to talk about the incident now. She had her daughter crying on the phone, walking around alone, and the only way her mum could see her location was through a ‘find my friend’ app where she helped guide direct her from miles away. Laura said, even before she rang The Jury Inn, she called multiple Plymouth taxi companies from her home in Sussex, hoping they could collect her or help her get to accommodation, but none of them were able to help. She said: “It was a desperate situation. She was at risk where she was. I honestly feel like common sensea young girl turns up at that time in the morning, why on earth would you not just let her sit in the lobby  Why not help her out or offer her some kind of support  “I am so physically shocked. If something had happened, I felt so powerless because it would have taken me five hours to get to her. “It physically makes me cry thinking about what happened because a common sense approach would be to get her in a position of safety.

Amy Smith, , has been getting tattoos since she was  and she has her own tattoo gun. The mum, from Leicester, says her appearance gets judged as security guards follow her in the shops and other parents cross the road when they see her. Amy, who is a mum to Elijah, six, and Remy, one, also says sheaposs been told she shouldnapost look like that. Her oldest child is protective over Amy and even draws his own tattoo designs to cheer her up. She said: Now, I have two children, Elijah and Remy, and my tattoos attract a lot of attention. “Parents my own age can be very judgemental – some parents cross the road to get their children away from me, and I tend to get followed by security in shops that don’t know me.  “My kids have witnessed the negative comments and they see the way that it makes me feel – I feel like my kids are far more accepting than most people because of it. “However, it can also be really heart-warming. I get spoken to a lot on the school run or at school events, and parents have even turned around and told me that they would love to be able to have tattoos like mine. “I know that as a parent, I shouldn’t be scared to be who I want to be.” She hopes she can show her children that it is to be yourself and let other people do the same. Amy said: “Sometimes people tell me, ‘you’re a parent’ or ‘you’re a woman,’ so I ‘shouldn’t look like this’ – I’ve had my fair share of backlash.“Still, some of the responses I’ve had make me feel really great – I’ve had messages on Instagram with people telling me that I’ve inspired them to get a tattoo that they wanted.“I don’t regret a thing – my tattoos have changed my le. It’s brought so many opportunities to do some really amazing things. “I’m comfortable with who I am, and I want to encourage my children to feel the same way.”  Amy does say not all of her experiences are negative as her tattoos are sometimes a conversation starter on the school run, and some parents do chat to her, even asking for advice about getting tattoos. She hopes to raise her sons to be open and accepting of others – no matter how they look or dress. She said: “I’ve always been interested in tattoos. I remember watching Miami Ink when I was around , and from then, my heart was set on getting tattoos and learning how to do them. “I got my first tattoo at thirteen – a stick-and-poke, but because I was so hell-bent on learning how to do tattoos, I was bought a tattoo machine for my fourteenth birthday. “That really helped me to get the practice I needed to get into the industry.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsSchool runTattoos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The new iant of the coronavirus, known as the apos Omicron iant apos, is now leading to rising fears of stricter measures being put in place by prime minister Boris Johnson and the government.Hereaposs what you need to know about the chances of another lockdown and Omicron.Will there be another UK lockdown due to rising Omicron cases  Rising cases in Europe have led to restrictions and the most stringent measures have been put in place in Austria, where a lockdown has been extended until December . Another lockdown in the UK is currently unlikely, however, and this is due to a number of reasons. The first is that, unlike at the time of the last lockdowns, most of the UKaposs population has been vaccinated. Recent figures show that . million people have been fully vaccinated, which is around % of the population. The government hopes that a huge rise in cases and increased pressure on the NHS due to Omicron will be prevented by the vaccine, though they have reacted by encouraging all eligible adults to get their booster jab to increase immunity.The other reason is that locking down over Christmas would likely have a signicant economic impact. Hospitality outlets like bars and restaurants do not require people to have masks on in the hope that they would not face a hit due to the restrictions. The sector was hit particularly hard during the last lockdowns. What is Omicron   aposOmicronapos refers to the new iant of the virus that has been found and it is believed to have originated in South Africa. Scientists are particularly worried about this iant as it has around  dferent mutations, this is around double that of the Delta iant which currently accounts for % of the UKaposs cases, according to recent data.Too little is currently known about how severe this mutant strain is and tests are currently being undertaken by the producers of vaccines, as well as the World Health Organisation . This means that it is not yet fully knownthe vaccine will be a good enough defence against the new strain, although experts are currently fairly confident that it will be.However, the BBC reported leaked minutes of a government SAGE meeting, which said the impact of Omicron is highly uncertain and that there could be a potentially signicant wave of infections.Are Omicron Covid cases rising   There could well be many more, but at the time of writing there  cases of the Omicron iant have so far been identied in the UK. Nine of the cases were in London, with one in Liverpool, one in Norfolk, another in Nottingham and nine in Scotland. It is by no means the dominant iant yet, but worries over how transmissible it is could indicate that the number of cases will rise. Dr Jenny Harries, CEO of the UK Health Security agency, told: It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focused contact tracing.That’s why it’s critical that anyone with Covid- symptoms isolates and gets a PCR test immediately. Some believe the iant could be a good thing due to its reported aposmilderapos cold-like symptoms, and the possibility of it overtaking and dominating the Delta iant, but research by scientists is ongoing.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DeltaNHSWorld Health OrganisationBoris JohnsonCoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A further  people who had meals at the pub on October , , were also unwell while only three diners were fine and that was because they ordered vegetarian options, , reported the Daily Star.. John Croucher, the -year-old former head chef, was handed a four-month suspended jail sentence at Reading Crown Court on Tuesday.Members of the Holy Trinity Church gathered for a meal at the pub but the meat in the shepherdaposs pie was not cooked properly the night before, the court heard.  Croucher admitted that he had been rushed and placed the meat, which had not been fully cooked, in cling film in the fridge. The next day it was cooked again with mashed potato but the temperature of the meat wasnapost checked. Croucher admitted to contravening food regulations and said: I really hate to say it but I think I was rushed. I was rushing. Remorse is an understatement. This is something I will never forget. Because of it, I am a better chef and it is just a shame the cost of it had to be what it was. Neil Billingham, the -year-old owner and landlord, admitted to three charges of contravening food regulations.  He was personally fined £,, plus £, court costs, and his company The Bobcat Pub Co was fined nearly £,. Judge Sarah Campbell said: A healthy and well person died of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage induced from vomiting. No sentence I can pass can reflect the loss caused to the family. The Crewe Arms is an important pub to the local community. I have read many references from members of the community, who all say Mr Billingham worked hard to maintain the support of the community, including Mrs Neuman’s daughter. But the judge refused to accept claims that it was a one-off mistake. While it has since gained the maximum five star food hygiene rating, at the time of the tragedy the Crewe Arms had just one star. Prosecutor Carl May-Smith pointed out how food safety officers had even been trying to help venues in the area with low ratings. He said: The pub even had the advantage of coaching from the local authority. Inspections before the offence showed there was no food safety management system in place.

Rosalyn OaposConnor, , was with her mum in the Urmston store in Manchester when she became dizzy and leless, falling to the floor. But a quick-thinking hero nurse had seen the commotion while doing her own shopping and instantly rushed over to help.The lovely and caring stranger helped Rosaylyn booster her sugar levels by giving her a Lindt chocolate and helped her into a wheelchair before she was taken to Trafford General Hospital, the Manchester Evening News reports. Rosalyn said: I began feeling a little dizzy for a few seconds then began feeling energyless. “Then I lost consciousness and collapsed to the floor. “There was a couple stood by me, one of them was an off-duty nurse with blonde hair. “As I came around, I was still rather weak and quite thirsty so she stayed with me and called for a member of staff. “My mum then found out and the nurse gave me a Lindt truffle to boost my sugar levels. After running tests doctors believe a neurological issue or low blood sugar could have caused Rosalyn to faint. But the grateful shopper has thanked the selfless stranger for her actions and quick-thinking care. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, she added: “She was so caring and lovely. Nurses are amazing and so selfless. “She didn’t have to stay with me but she did. “It is a beautul thing knowing that there are people out there who give so much care and compassion and expect nothing back.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sainsburys\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The vaccine was administered to millions across the world, but the side-effect meant that the vaccine was no longer offered to those under -years-old. However, after being given government funding to conduct research on the vaccine, scientists from Cardf University and Arizona State University have found some answers. Their research shows that a protein in the blood is attracted to a key component of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine which causes a reaction that results in the clots. When the vaccine is injected into the body, some of its contents can go into the blood stream.  In extremely rare cases, this can cause a protein called platelet factor  to be attracted to the vaccine. When this occurs, the body mistakes the protein for the virus, and releases antibodies to fight it. This results in a blood clot forming as the antibodies join together.The findings of the study were published in the journal Science Advances.While this research has provided an understanding into the formation of the blood clots, it is not yet clear exactly why this happens. The creators of the vaccine stress that the blood clots are more likely to be caused by coronavirus infection rather than the actual vaccine.Earlier in May, the UKaposs medicines safety regulator said there had been  clotting cases and  deaths after . million doses of the vaccine were given. This caused the vaccine to not be given to under-s. At present, blood clots from the vaccine have been linked to  deaths out of nearly  million doses of AstraZeneca. The vaccines that are distributed in the UK contain a party portion of the Covid-virusaposs genetic code which is injected into the body to train the immune system. Some vaccines package the code inside spheres of fat, whereas AstraZeneca used an adenovirus, which in their case is a common cold that acts as a delivering agent. The scientists suspected that this aspect of the vaccine could be linked to the blood clots. Their research found that the outer area of the adenovirus attracts the platelet factor four protein. Professor Alan Parker, one of the researchers at Cardf University, said the chain reaction is an ultra-rare side-effect that occurs in a very small number of cases.He told BBC News: The adenovirus has an extremely negative surface, and platelet factor four is extremely positive and the two things fit together quite well. What we have is the trigger, but thereaposs a lot of steps that have to happen next. Despite the very small risk of blood clots, scientists urge the public to still get vaccinated as the benefits heavily outweigh the risks. Professor Parker added: You could never have predicted it would have happened and the chances are vanishingly small, so we need to remember the bigger picture of the number of lives this vaccine has saved. This groundbreaking discovery has given a better understanding into the formation of blood clots, but there is still some research to be done. The researchers believe that the next stage may be misplaced immunity, but this needs to be confirmed in further studies.  Dr Will Lester, a consultant haematologist, said: This is a very detailed scientic study from experts in the field and provides further pieces to a jigsaw of understanding vaccine induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. The authors reasonably speculate that one might be able to mody future adenoviral based vaccines to avoid this unwanted rare untoward effect. Many questions still remain unanswered including whether some people may be more susceptible than others and why the thrombosis is most commonly in the veins of the brain and liver but this may come with time and further research.

The makesht Christmas tree was then wrapped in gold and red tinsel. Ella and her pal then covered the base of it with brown paper and fixing it down with sticky tape. They then put a silver, present bow on the top for a star. The pair at Leeds Beckett University, West Yorkshire, filmed them giving the cone - which they insisted wasn’t pinched - the makeover. She posted it on TikTok and the  second clip has got more than , views and , likes.  It finishes with them putting their homemade Christmas tree in their living room of their uni digs. Ella, of Newcastle, said: Turning our not stolen traffic cone into a Christmas tree. The video had the Frank Sinantra festive hit aposLet it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow aposplaying. Fellow student Jaden Higgins said: Iaposm howling. I love this. Another - called Holly - added: Should put it back out like that after Christmas. David said: Canapost wait til Iaposm in uni now. Now we are in December, people up and down the country are bring out the decorations to celebrate.But one townaposs attempt to get into the mood has been met with giggles from locals, after a Christmas tree was installed at a wonky angle.The tree, covered in blue and white lights with red baubles, appeared to mimic the Leaning Tower of Pisa with Gosport residents, Hants, jokily posing aspropping it up. Jan Richardson, who lives in the area, said she saw it being put up while gales were blowing due to Storm Arwen. She said: I watched the tree being taken off the lorry the other night and they had a dreadful time with the wind. The installation of the festive decorations has not been smooth sailing as the townaposs first tree was damaged in transit.

Becky Jackson, , and her two sons claim they have been sharing their home in Liverpool, Merseyside with the unwelcome fellow occupants for six years. Now the mum of two says the situation has become so bad that the sound of them running around haunts her even when sheaposs not there, leaving her too terried to .I am too scared to even go back to my house today — I just canapost do it, itaposs too much. Becky told the Liverpool Echo. She said: I went to my sisteraposs last night. I canapost even sleep — Iaposm so used to hearing rats, I started hearing noises in her house and she doesnapost even have them.  It used to be I could just hear them scurrying in the walls when I was at home, now I can hear them running around the house. I catch them on my camera in the kitchen when Iaposm in the living room. Theyaposre living here with me. Rats normally come out at night, but not these. These have got brave — they come out in the daytime. In a bid to provide evidence to her housing association to get them to act on the situation, Becky has resorted to laying bait in front of cameras, capturing footage of the rats. Now the mum, whose sons are just five and six, fears for the safety and health of her family. She said: Iaposve been told [the housing association] canapost see any evidence, so I thought aposlet me bait my own house to get the proof I needapos. I took a loaf out of the freezer to defrost and when I came back they had chewed through it so I knew I could bait them with bread. But theyaposve become immune to the baitthat makes sense.  Theyaposll chew through anything though — I came home once and they had chewed through my childrenaposs vitamins. They donapost care what they eat. She added: On my camera I saw a rat run down my fridge and two minutes later, my eldest child was stood where it had been. That rat could have bit him and they carry all kinds of diseases and stuff. One of my children is on the pathway to autism and ADHD and heaposd sit there and play with the rats and poison. My children should be able to walk around their house without me worrying that theyaposre going to get sick. The property is managed by Cobalt Housing Association, who Becky claims have not done enough to solve the problem adding that they have sent someone out on two occasions. Instead, she believes the situation is so bad that the house needs entirely rebuilding from scratch as she in unable to pinpoint the source of the issue. A spokesperson for Cobalt Housing Association told the ECHO : We are sorry for the problems Ms Jackson has been experiencing. We are already speaking with her, and a formal complaint has been raised and is being dealt with. We have been working with Ms Jackson and our contractors to address the problems, and employed an environmental and pest control services company to provide additional support to resolve the situation. A number of housing officers and surveyors have also attended the property to support the process. Unfortunately we cannot control vermin living outside in the local neighbourhood, however we will continue to do all we can to seek out any further access routes to eradicate problems, and already have future appointments for property works booked in to prevent any future access to Ms Jackson’s property.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Giant rats\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A World Health Organizationofficial has told the Reuters news agency that most people are not getting seriously ill, although it could still be the case. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, a top WHO adviser, said: “In terms of the severity profile, we have seen reports of cases with Omicron that go from mild disease all the way to severe disease. “There is some indication that some of the patients are presenting with mild disease, but again it is early days. We do have a surveillance bias right now in terms of the cases that are being detected.  “There is also a suggestion of increased hospitalisations across South Africa, but that could be the sheer fact that we have more cases. “If you have more cases you will have more hospitalisations.” Meanwhile, a health director in Botswana said  out of  people infected had no symptoms, while the other three had “very, very mild” illness.

The Met Office has issued three yellow warnings for ice across the UK and a weather alert states that there is an % chance of severe cold and heavy snow between Wednesday and this Saturday.It states to expect: Some injuries from slips and falls on icy surface. Probably some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle path. Some roads and railways likely to be affected by ice and perhaps snow, resulting in longer journey times.  Netweather charts for Thursday show that the temperature could hit lows of -C in Scotland and -C across northern England, the South East and Wales. But the wind chill factor means that these temperatures of -C will feel more like -C. It is set to be another bitterly cold night on Thursday with weather charts showing freezing blue patches for much of the country. WXCharts maps suggest that there could be up to cm of snow in northern Scotland overnight on Wednesday and spreading across northern England on Thursday.  A Met Office spokesperson said: Itaposs going to be a lot colder today with showers turning wintry in the north. Patchy rain and snow will then affect some western and southern areas before more snow over the next few days. Only a few areas will be spared. The snow is expected to remain over the coming days and over the weekend despite some slightly milder temperatures.Netweather senior forecaster Jo Farrow, reported the Express, said: It’s going to turn colder and there is a bit of snow in the forecast for the next few days. In the blustery flow over Britain, there will be further downpours with hail showers possible as the wind veers to the north. For the UK, a colder airflow follows. Digging down from the Arctic right through western Europe as the jetstream buckles. The low pressure shts towards the Baltic Sea, the Azores high is in place and the cold northerly wind will bring some snow showers. By Thursday night a frontal system will be toppling in from the Atlantic with another low pressure for Saturday. It’s all quite active and mobile.UK forecast for the next  days Today: Rain, sleet and some snow clearing from southwestern parts. Wintry showers affecting the north and east, slowly becoming confined to Norfolk this afternoon, with gales along North Sea coasts slowly easing. Mostly dry and sunny inland but feeling cold. Tonight: Rain reaching northwestern parts, preceded by some snow across Scotland, and moving southeastwards across most parts. Turning milder for most after a cold start. Friday: Outbreaks of rain and drizzle clearing southeastwards, though further rain likely in the southwest later. Brighter in the north with a few showers for northern and western Scotland. Feeling milder. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Sunny spells and blustery showers with snow on hills this weekend, becoming confined to eastern areas on Sunday. Rain and perhaps some snow spreading east on Monday with showers following.

Within a few years of having the implants, the former DJ who now works as a recruitment director began to suffer from severe heart palpitations, panic attacks and muscle weakness. Her symptoms became worse and she started sleeping for up to  hours a day and was too weak to climb the stairs or brush her teeth. GPs were baffled by her condition that left her unable to walk at one point.  Emma decided to go to a al medicine practitioner. She was horried to find out she had Breast Implant Illness as her body was reacting to silicone that had been passing from her implants into the surrounding tissue and beyond - a process called aposbleeding. In , Emma flew to the Netherlands and paid £, to have her implants removed. Now, she has celebrated winning a boxing match just  months after recovering. Sporty Emma has regained her energy and has celebrated a spectacular boxing match victory - just  months since the debilitating symptoms had left her so weak she would struggle to even brush her hair. She said: When I had the implants out, I instantly looked like a dferent person.  She added: [Breast implant illness] canapost be denied any longer. I want to raise awareness. After the initial excitement of her bustier cleavage, Emma began to experience bad skin, panic attacks and feel exhausted no matter how much she slept. This continued over several years resulting in her fearing sheaposd suffered a stroke when she collapsed at home. Emma said: I felt so much more confident and loved them but in the first few years my skin started to change. She added: This is all linked to producing cortisol so that the body could continue to fight what it perceived as a foreign object. Sometimes Iaposd sleep for  hours a day then it would switch where Iaposd have that same level of exhaustion but couldnapost sleep.  A month later she collapsed at home. She said: It was terrying. I thought I was having a stroke. I didnapost understand what was happening. I rang my mum and she rushed down the motorway. We went to AE and I was in hospital for three days. I left that hospital unable to walk through the doors because it was too far. I could barely get to the toilet. They did loads of blood tests and told me there was nothing wrong, they just dismissed it. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.That was my le then for seven years. You feel a bit crazy because you know thereaposs something physically wrong. Her symptoms forced her to take time off work and she had to buy an automatic car because she was too weak to change gears. Emma said: I couldnapost even brush my own hair. I was exhausted. I used to have to use my left arm to hold my right hand in place to brush it. I had to shower sitting down. Breast Implant Illnessis a term sometimes used by people to describe a iety of health problems they associate with their breast implants.The reports often describe symptoms like aposbrain fogapos, fatigue, anxiety and joint pain.These health problems are very concerning for those experiencing them. There have also been reports of a serious medical condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body .Some people have reported their symptoms improve once their breast implants were removed.Currently, it is not knownthere is a link between breast implants and the reported health problems, as there is no single disease which could explain the symptoms some people are reporting to us or to their clinicians. Source: Gov.uk It was a case of when I was brushing my teeth, it was exhausting and painful. My legs used to burn so much by the second step of the stairs. Iaposd have to stop halfway up. Emma finally had her implants removed in July . Emma said: They were half full when they took them out. When she [the surgeon] showed me, she said aposlook how much has bled into your systemapos. [After my implants were removed] all of the panic stopped, all the palpitations stopped. It wasnapost just physical symptoms. They were toxic. After experiencing an incredible recovery, Emma gradually built herself up, from running a slow km to attending Thai boxing once a week. Earlier this year, Emma was able to start training intensely for her first boxing match and in October and won. Emma said: It was a very big process from then. I had to slowly build up. She added: I was ill up until they came out in July  and I started training properly within a few months. The [Thai boxing] win was great but it wasnapost about the win. I knew Iaposd won and done well and thataposs brilliant, but that moment was about everything. It was about everything thataposd happened in those eight years.

Thanos and Dunder - who are brothers - turned nine and three quarter months old, and in a nod to the wizarding franchise’s popular Kingaposs Cross railway , their owner let them pick their own houses.Typically, young witches and wizards get their Hogwarts letter aged , and according to thePedigree dog age calculator , Thanos and Dunder received their letter slightly earlier, as they would be  years old in human years.In an adorable video, Thanos and Dunder, who live in the USA, were seen wrapped in Christmas lights as their owner explained they’d be choosing their own Hogwarts houses.  For those unfamiliar with the Harry Potter series, these are Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. In the clip, four bandanas are laid out on the floor, with Thanos - named after the Marvel character - choosing first to the tune of Hedwig’s Theme. There was no doubt in his mind that he was a Slytherin, just like Draco Malfoy. Dunder, who was named after the American The Office character, was able to pick his house second. He bypassed the Gryffindor and Slytherin bandanas, and decided he was going to be a Hufflepuff. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter. Both dogs were pictured wearing a sorting hat and their new bandana with a PetSmart toy corresponding to their new Hogwarts house. It comes after the US brand launched their Harry Potter range of pet products earlier this month. While one viewer pointed out that their names ‘fit the houses’, another askedtheir personality matched, to which their owner said: “It’s pretty crazy that they really do!” Another commenter added: “Slytherins and Hufflepuffs make the best buds.” Thanos and Dunder were from the same litter of puppies, with Thanos adopted at birth, and Dunder arriving at five months old after his first owners ed him to the breeders. The American Kennel Club describe the breed as ‘playful, charming and inquisitive’ - and are famously watchful ‘nanny dogs’.  Originating from the Swiss Alps, these gentle giants were used as search and rescue dogs, and are often depicted wearing a barrel of brandy around their neck. Thanos and Dunder aren’t the only Saint Bernards to give viewers a giggle on TikTok either.Clumsy puppyGigi managed to flood her owneraposs gardenwith a pool they’d bought to keep her cool in the Calornian summer.The one-year-old pup attempted to clamber into the pool, but soon water was gushing from the edges as the huge dog found itself partially submerged.In another clip, Roman the Saint Bernard was caught onCCTV in a ‘prison break’ type escapefrom his garden.When the two-year-old found himself separated from his siblings, he didn’t hesitate in jumping over the tall gate. The other four Saintt Bernards, named Lilia, Zvezda, Evita and Falkor, caught on to their brotheraposs antics and decided to give him encouragement and a helping hand in his mission.

It didnapost last between the young lovers, leading Monette, , to betroth a man who she had always had a lot of fun with.  Sadly that union also fell apart, only for them to give it another go shortly after they officially split.

However, as much as she loved his kids, the pair proved not to be a forever couple.“Number five was probably one of the loves of my le,” she said on T LC ’s Addicted to Marriage.“Husband number six just seemed so nice and kind so I married him and then I married him again.”  While some people may have hung up their wedding shows after number seven, Monette is not one to be deterred.

And this sassy baby is adamant that her meals are to be shared with her canine best friend.In the hilarious TikTok clip posted by@sofia.and.baz , baby Sofia is digging into some slices of ham in her high chair when she decides to tear a piece off to feed to Belgian Malinois Dutch shepherd cross Baz, who is waiting expectantly beside her.When Sofia’s mum tells her “no” the toddler isn’t happy about it at all, throwing what the clip describes as a “minor temper tantrum” and crying in protest while thrashing in her chair. “I think I won this battle,” reads the caption by Sofia’s mum - but the victory doesn’t last long.  Defiant Sofia soon picks herself up from the defeat by casually grabbing another piece of ham, tearing off a smaller piece and then, looking her mum right in the eye, holding it out to Baz who seizes the opportunity and quickly gobbles it up. “Think again mom,” the clip reads. The priceless look on little Sofia’s face, completely unfazed by her mum’s scolding, has left TikTok viewers in stitches. “She said, OK we listened to your feedback and have improved our serving size!” one person commented on the funny clip. “Umm mom, that’s her dog!” another viewer said, to which Sofia’s mum replied: “I have no say anymore.”  The adorablesofia.and.bazTikTok account is full of videos of the cheeky pair being thick as thieves, showing affectionate dog Baz sticking close by Sofia’s side from the moment she arrived home as a newborn baby.Baz isn’t the only dog to find his new best friend in the youngest member of the household.German shepherd Brodyloved his owner’s new baby so much that he tried to initiate a game of fetch - failing to grasp that the tiny two-month-old was a bit too young to throw his ball. In the cute TikTok video from@keepingupwiththekokals , poor Brody doesn’t understand his owner’s patient explanation that the baby can’t yet play with the ball that the dog has dropped expectantly at his feet. Some dogs even get stuck in with the childcare side - hearts melted over a TikTok clip posted by@wrigleyandluluof the family’s dedicated dog, who had learned to dutully bring his owner nappies for their new baby when it came to changing time.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesDogsTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But, when the graveyard in question is Edinburgh’s world famous Greyfriars Kirkyard, making an exception is encouraged. Nestled in the heart of Edinburgh’s Old Town, the church, Greyfriars Kirk, was founded in  as the first church to be built in post-reformation Scotland. Burials in the graveyard surrounding the church have been taking place since the th century, resulting in it being the final resting place of a number of notable Edinburgh residents. Amongst the heavily decorated tombstones and mausoleums belonging to lords, scholars and architects, lie resting places of those whose names will most certainly ring bells.  It is in this famed graveyard that you will find Tom Riddell, William McGonagall and a certain Robert Potter. Rumour has it that the names emblazoned on ious headstones in the graveyard inspired J.K. Rowling to create characters of similar names in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. It is also believed that Hogwarts was based on the neighbouring George Heriot’s School, and another iconic Edinburgh location, Victoria Street, gave her the idea for Diagon Alley. Rowling wrote much of the Harry Potter and the Philosopheraposs Stone book sitting in The Elephant House café, which has sweeping views across Greyfriars Kirkyard. She has previously acknowledged her connection to Edinburgh stating: “Edinburgh is very much home for me and is the place where Harry evolved over seven books and many, many hours of writing in its cafés.”  Thomas Riddell was a general who died on  November  at the age of . It is commonly speculated that Thomas’ name could have inspired the character of Lord Voldemort and his real name of Tom Marvolo Riddle.The site is so popular with Harry Potter fans flocking it have its own location marker on Google Maps. In July , the City of Edinburgh Council even warned of ‘signicant erosion’ around Riddell’s grave. William McGonagall was unfortunately known as one of the worst poets in Scotland, one of his most famous works being that of ‘The Tay Bridge Disaster’ which is based on a horric rail crash in Dundee, his hometown. McGonagall also worked as a weaver, struggling to make much money from his poetry. He was buried in an unmarked grave, although an inscribed slab was later installed in . It is thought that his name inspired that of Professor Minerva McGonagall.  Greyfriars Kirkyard also features a grave belonging to Mrs Elizabeth Moodie, a name which may have inspired the fictional character Alastor ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody. Look carefully and you’ll also spot the names of Scrymgeour , Cruikshanksa family of Potters and a family with the name Black. In addition, the entire Kirkyard is rumoured to have been the inspiration behind the fictional resting place of Harry Potter’s parents, Lily and James, in Godric’s Hollow. If you’d like to explore the Greyfriars Kirkyard for yourself, it is open  hours a day, and with many unofficial city-based Harry Potter tours, you’ll be sure to spot the resting places of those who likely served as inspiration for J.K. Rowling. However,you have no current plans to visit the city of Edinburgh, you can do so with a virtual tour via the Greyfriars website.

One woman, who already had several tattoos, has shared how she was recently offered a free inking from her tattoo artist after he heard she was going through a rough time.In a post on TikTok, a user named @itsmehollyholliday, explained that she was going through a separation from her husband and as such a local tattoo artist said heaposd give her some aposink therapyapos. Holly claimed sheaposd had work done by him previously, so trusted him to do another great tattoo, reports The Daily Star. She picked out a gorgeous design to go on her forearm, featuring flowers, a stack of books and some stars sparkles, however, things didnapost quite go to plan. In a series of videos online Holly, who lives in the US, shared how her arm had been ruined by the tattoo artist leaving her angry and crying. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Her original post was captioned: Iaposm so angry, Iaposve cried so much. I trusted this artist, heaposs done great work in the past for me... My trust is now ruined and so is my arm. In this clip, she showed off the botched inking, with wobbly lines and random shading. A follow-up video saw her provide more of a backstory, saying: I get to his house about : and Iaposm there for like an hour and a half, weaposre just talking back and forth, she says in a follow-up video. Iaposm playing with the dog, no big deal. He starts getting everything set up and like I said, just normal conversation, I did not think anything was off. So he gets me in the chair and starts free-handing a design based off of the original cute little book tattoo I found online. I didnapost want this exact, thing just something like it. He drew it on, looked great, I made sure the placement was fine. Everything looked good. Holly goes on to explain that after heaposd started on her arm, she noticed his hand was bearing down quite hard and going back and forth, then his head began to droop. So she asked himeverything was ok. When he replied, she claims he was slurring his word, which is when she became rather freaked out and tried to come up with a plan to get out of there without p***ing him off. She added: I am fully aware that I am at fault here for not stopping the artist sooner, but I was trying not to put myself in a situation where it could have escalated to something worse. Iaposm trying to conjure up a story and I noticed that the linework was s***ty. I keep looking over every once in a while and itaposs making me sick to look at. Thereaposs a random line right here. I donapost know what that was supposed to be. As well as a botched design, Holly shows how she also ended up with a random ink mark on her hand, as he caught her with the needle while getting more ink. Eventually, she managed to get out of his house, by getting a friend to call with a fake emergency. He has contacted me several times asking me to come back and let him fix it but I donapost want to go back to this man, she adds. I donapost want to have anything to do with this man, Iaposve not even confronted this man about this tattoo yet.

Since Monday, burning rock from the eruption poured onto the towns that sat around the volcano, reaching speeds of up to one metre per second. La Palma is a Canary Island that was home to , people, but since the eruption on September  , , people have been displaced. The volcano erupted after days of seismic activities and earthquakes on the island, which resulted in the country being put on amber alert.  It had been  years since the volcano last blew, which lead to the evacuation of the town of Fuencaliente. The volcano also erupted in , which lasted for  days and resulted in a large crack forming on its surface that was one-and-a-half kilometres in . This time, lava has been flowing for around two-and-a-half months, with the Canary Islands Volcanology Institute reporting more molten flow this week. Scorching hot lava has continued to light up the island as it has been spat out of Cumbre Vieja. A number of new volcanic vents opened in La Palma, releasing new lava that threatens threatened to intensy the impact on homes and land. A staggering  hectares of land, a third of which being farmland, has been destroyed by the molten lava. Thankfully, no deaths have been caused by the crisis.  This has caused the islandaposs economy to be hit as avocado and banana plantations are engulfed by the rock. As a result of the devastation, the Spanish government has pledged  million eurosin aid to help residents of the island. The lava has already reached the Atlantic with molten rock falling off clfs into the ocean, causing a total of  hectares of lava landfill. Since the eruption, La Palma has continued to experience a number of earthquakes. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to clear roads and uncover buildings, with the Spanish Navy being called in to manage the crisis.

It would be the largest outbreak of the latest strain in the world,confirmed.Reports said  people had received a positive PCR test after Norwegian renewable energy company Scatecaposs Christmas dinner at Louise Restaurant  Bar in Aker Brygge, Oslo, on Friday.Another  people have had positive lateral flow tests. Most of those infected had been at the dinner, reportedly held in a closed room. Later in the night the restaurant became a nightclub with several guests.It has not been confirmed to be the Omicron iant yet, but tests have ruled out the Delta iant, NRK reports. Head of the infection tracking team in Oslo west, Jorum Thaulow, told Avisa Oslo: We have not received it definitively confirmed, but there are very strong indications that it is Omicron in this outbreak. The cases are being treated asthey have the Omicron iant with the correct self-isolation guidelines in place. One of those infected had recently been to South Africa, reports said.  Little is known about the recently-discovered strain but there are fears due to its high level of mutation. Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of UKHSA, said: “We are continuing our efforts to understand the effect of this iant on transmissibility, severe disease, mortality, antibody response and vaccine efficacy.“ Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against this new iant – please get your first, second, third or booster jab without delay. “Please make sure to wear a mask in line with government guidance, including on public transport and in shops, to help break the chains of transmission and slow the spread of this new iant.It comes as early indications show most Omicroncoronavirus cases are mild, the World Health Organisation has said. The official believes there is no evidence to suggest the efficacy of vaccines reduces when battling against the new iant.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Christmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

November .Star stung the hosts at Cowan Park, Barrhead, with an excellent start to the match, forcing a succession of corners before the ever-dangerous Coll McCallum finished after an excellent delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes. Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

quiet, you may hear thin, plaintive whistles from overhead, which mark the arrival of redwings.Redwings are highly sociable ndash it is not uncommon to see them in flocks of hundreds as they roam throughout the country.Their main diet is berries and they seem to display a preference for some types over others it is believed that this is based on the softness and sweetness of the berries.In mild winters you are likely to see large flocks of redwings feasting on their favourites of hawthorns and rowans however, in harsh months they may forage for fruit in gardens or urban areas.Once disturbed, the birds will take off and seek refuge in neighbouring trees or hedges. Alongside eating berries, they also feed on small insects and mealworms.Unlike other members of the thrush family which build nests in the trees, redwings prefer to build their cup-shaped nests on the ground.The nest is usually well hidden in the dense vegetation and made out of grass, mosses and twigs.Most redwings breed in Scandinavia and Iceland, with a small number breeding in the UK, most of which are concentrated in the Scottish Highlands. The population arriving here from Iceland appears slightly darker and bigger and it is treated as the distinct subspecies coburni.Unlike many migratory birds, which remain loyal to their wintering grounds, redwings present a nomadic lestyle ndash driven by food availability, they rarelyto the same place.I have already seen my first redwings in Edinburgh but I am yet to find them in East Lothian this autumn.Last winter in Musselburgh was fabulous! I particularly remember the snowfall in January during a couple of days I took off work. I liked every minute and, despite cold hands and feet, I enjoyed walking along the Esk.At one point, I spotted a buzzard perching on a snowy branchand headed towards it.As soon as I captured the bird of prey, I heard a familiar lsquotseeprsquo call coming from the hedges.I knew the redwings must have been having a lavish meal as the call was getting louder with every step I took, but I could not see them.It amazes me how dficult it is to spot these birds, even though they are medium-sized and always in large groups.I managed to sneak inside the bush and, when I looked up, I saw at least  redwings. The birds were incredibly noisy and constantly on the move. The whole bush was bustling and I felt like I was sitting at the heart of a busy factory!Until now, I found that experience one of the most challenging. It was not easy to operate the camera in such a tight space, with twigs scratching my face the entire time. I did not have a clear view of the birds either, but I could not move as it would spook them!The low winter sun was already disappearing but, eventually, I did manage to find a gap and push the camera through. After taking a few photographs, I decided to head back home.When I ed to the same spot the following day, the redwings were gone.If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have several designs of my WildleCalendars for sale.

meeting to discuss the future of the service, before he received a response.The X bus was suspended last year by East Coast Buses, a subsidiary of Lothian Buses, following the introduction of national lockdown restrictions.The service ran through North Berwick, Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry, then directly to Edinburgh via the A.Commuters from Dirleton, Gullane and Aberlady now face an extra hour in their daily commute to Edinburgh using the  bus service, which stops at Prestonpans, Wallyford, Musselburgh and Portobello.An online petition launched by Mr Hoy calling for the reinstatement of the service has now received more than  signatures.Mr Hoy said: ldquoIn early October, my office contacted East Coast Buses, who issued a standard response outlining the reasons for continued withdrawal of the service, including challenges with recruitment, the need to prioritise key services and the focus on delivering the  service.ldquoI recognise these challenges, but I also recognise they apply across all routes across the whole of the Lothians and are not confined to the X route.ldquoAfter a number of residents living in Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry reached out to me about the X bus, I launched a petition calling for the reinstatement of the service.ldquoI wrote to East Coast Buses on two occasions requesting a face-to-face meeting, and followed this up with a third letter to the interim managing director of Lothian Buses.ldquoLothian Buses is owned by the four Lothian council areas, which includes East Lothian Council. That makes it accountable to the residents of our community.ldquoThe number of signatures on the petition shows the clear strength of feeling in the area about reinstating the X bus.ldquoAt this point, Lothian Buses have their heads buried in the sand ndash they cannot keep ignoring our communities.In a letter to Mr Hoy dated November , Nigel Serafini, interim managing director of Lothian Buses, said it was the companyrsquos ldquopriority to re-establish the X ldquoas soon as driver resource permits.He added: ldquoThe X covers no additional areas that service  does not .ldquoIn contrast, the X is the only service that operates to East Linton, West Barns and Dunbar. Without the X these communities would be without a regular bus service whilst, as explained, the same is not true of Gullane, Aberlady and Dirleton.A spokesperson for East Coast Buses added: ldquoEast Coast Buses is absolutely committed to delivering for all of our customers in East Lothian.ldquoLike many other transport providers at this time, we are in an extremely challenging recruitment market, which, coupled with our safety protocols for colleagues who find themselves in the Covid- track and trace cycle, means that we are experiencing signicant resourcing dficulties in our driving team on a day-to-day basis.ldquoWith limited available resource, we have made the dficult decision to prioritise key services which provide as many transport links as possible throughout East Lothian. In terms of service provision for Gullane and Aberlady, we have focused on delivering service , which provides critical local links along the coast as well as direct travel to Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"fate-rail-underpass-depends-new-housing-scheme-decision-dunbar","story":"Hundreds of new homes have been built at Hallhill, south of the railway line, in Dunbar in recent years.However, pedestrian links between the new homes and the older section of Dunbar are limited.East Lothian Council is keen to see a new pedestrian underpass to improve connections, which could be financed in part through another housing development in the area.It is expected that the cost of the underpass would be more than pound million, with part of the cost being covered by the Hallhill North development, which would consist of  houses and  flats.A decision is set to be made on the plans, which come from Taylor Wimpey East Scotland and Hallhill Developments Limited, at a meeting of East Lothian Councilrsquos planning committee on Tuesday.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who chairs the local authorityrsquos planning committee and represents Dunbar on East Lothian Council, noted that currently the only pedestrian access in the area was under the railway line beside Hallhill Sports Centre.He said: ldquoAs part of the application, the developer will be making a contribution to a new underpass at the railway.ldquoThere will not be enough funding coming from the developer to completely do this underpass.ldquoThat has to be done through grant funding from other agencies and the council themselves.ldquoAt the moment, all the houses from the Hallhill area to get to both the lower primary school and secondary school have to come underneath the tunnel, and children going to the Lochend Campus have to come back through that one.ldquoIt is really congested and we definitely need another way through there.An underpass was previously in place under the railway line but it was blocked up a number of years ago.Network Rail was approached about seeing it reopened but was not keen on the idea and East Lothian Council would have been liable for the structure.Mr Hampshire said: ldquoWe have to go with a completely new cut-through for pedestrians and cyclists, which will come through into Ash Grove swing park area but will be a safe route to get to the secondary school.Drawings and documents for the planning application were first submitted to East Lothian Councilrsquos planning department at the beginning of February last year.The scheme, to the west of the primary schoolrsquos Lochend Campus, originally featured  houses and  apartments."},{"url":null,"title":"storyteller-tim-porteus-standing-greens-preston-seton-gosford-by-election","story":"The -year-old, from Prestonpans, will also stand for the party in the ward at the full East Lothian Council elections next May.The early years charity worker ndash who writes the weekly Timrsquos Tales column for the Courier ndash works in Midlothian assisting children and families, and lives with his we Kate and three youngest children.Mr Porteus said: ldquoI am standing because I believe my community has amazing assets in its people and beautul natural setting, but we also have our issues that need to be addressed.ldquoI am passionate about education and childrenrsquos wellbeing but, here in East Lothian, we see signicant local issues around education provision and opportunities for our young people.ldquoThey have also been very adversely affected by Covid restrictions.

One was of a man who had died on the bus home from the surgery, where he also had had his ear syringed. The syringing had ruptured a carotid artery aneurysm, causing a massive stroke. The second was in a man who after his ldquojag pushed a loaded wheelbarrow up a steep bank. This stopped his failing heart: the vaccine was irrelevant.In a bizarre third case a coroner blamed a sudden death on our vaccine, given in a factory a few hours before. As a Duphar team had given the injections, we had to investigate. It turned out that the team had sent the man home without vaccinating him, as he had a headache. When we explained this to the coroner he ruled that the death must remain linked to influenza vaccine, as his decision could not be deleted. The three deaths remained on record as linked to vaccine.There are warnings against vaccinating people with egg allergies. As viruses used in vaccines were grown in eggs, it was assumed that even the few molecules of egg protein in each dose might initiate severe anaphylactic reactions in egg-allergic people. Professor Margaret Turner-Warwick, a world-renowned authority on allergies at the time, agreed to assess the risk. She gave  volunteers with severe egg allergy our vaccine under strictly controlled conditions. None of them had the slightest reaction to it. Egg allergy remains a contraindication to the vaccine.Irsquom content that authorities are over-cautious with their warnings about the safety of vaccines, but I hope that my experience will reassure people that they are safer than they are led to believe.Dr Tom Smith, Girvan.STOP PUTTING PROFITS BEFORE PEOPLEIAIN Macwhirter accepts that Covid- cannot be defeated anywhere until it is defeated everywhere yet suggests that we shouldnrsquot be shocked when our governments hoard vaccines . Precisely the opposite is true: such selfishness is short-sighted, self-defeating and it should shock and shame us all.Critically, the solution isnrsquot to choose whether people in the worldrsquos poorest countries should receive their first le-saving dose before or after people in Scotland and other rich countries receive their boosters: the solution is simply to make more vaccines so that everyone, everywhere has access to them, making us all safer.For that to happen, governments like the UKs must end their support for the pharmaceutical monopolies which are holding vaccine recipes and technology hostage by refusing to share them with other qualied manufacturers. The US is already backing action to address this. Billions of pounds of public money funded the development of these vaccines and itrsquos morally repugnant that people are being left to die en masse because of corporate greed.The consequences of the global vaccine shortage are crystal clear: less than three per cent of people in low-income countries are fully vaccinated. Epidemiologists have long warned this will lead to new iants like Omicron threatening lives, vaccine efficacy and fragile economic recoveries in all countries, including in Scotland.The Prime Minister must stop prioritising profits and patents over peoplersquos lives.Jamie Livingstone, Head of Oxfam Scotland, Glasgow.DISMAY AT PARKING DECISIONIT is very disappointing that concerns of local residents and businesses have not been listened to or addressed during the implementation of controlled parking in Glasgow.I suspect that Glasgow City Councilhad already decided upon the outcome of its supposed \"consultation\" well in advance. The only reason I can see why it is pushing through an am-pm seven-day parking zone in many residential parts of Glasgow is to make money, and it is not, as it is claiming, anything to do with providing a better environment for residents or businesses. It was clear that the majority view of locals, including business representatives, was that an am-pm Monday to Friday parking zone would have been much more effective and workable. We were just not listened to.GCC says it will address our concerns in a year. I am not convinced. If it cannot address them now, why should we believe that it will address them in a year We have children, grandchildren and elderly parents. They now have to pay to visit us in the evenings or weekends and worse still, can only stay for a maximum of three hours. This has become a very uncomfortable environment for families and we will leave as soon as we can manage to. Other families might not have an escape route. I am convinced that the orchestrators of this fiasco dont give two hoots, which really contradicts their vision of a \"world-class city with a thriving and inclusive economy where everyone can flourish\".Jacqueline Jack, Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen-glasgow-airport-bosses-uncertain-industry-future","story":"According to AGS Airports ndash owners of Glasgow and Aberdeen ndash new travel restrictions brought around by the Omicron iant has dealt a lsquohammer blowrsquo to the industry.The bosses are claiming that their airports have been brought to a lsquostandstillrsquo with Glasgow Airportrsquos traffic falling to its lowest for nearly  years.Glasgow Airport ndash Scotlands second busiest after Edinburgh ndash is expected to handle only . million passengers this year ndash the lowest since .There have also been reports of passengers cancelling flights or not showing up for them.:EasyJet plane to Glasgow declares mid-air emergencyAGS Airportsrsquo communications and sustainability director, Brian McClean yesterday told the house of commonsrsquo transport committee that the new restrictions will set the industry back decades as it is just starting to recover.Mr McClean said: \"We have been at a standstill for  months ndash itrsquos hugely concerning.\"Its another hammer blow to our recovery, to the passenger confidence that had slowly been ing.\"We were at a point where we believed we were starting to regrow and rebuild, but this is a real worry for everyone.ldquoThis has set us back decades and were are also now hearing anecdotal evidence of passengers cancelling flights and passengers not turning up for flights.He also said a huge redundancy programme last year was linked to the loss of around , jobs - both directly and indirectly.

The forecasting ides the road network into inidual routes rather than geographic areas making it easier for decision makers to direct resources where they are needed most.#Each island is designated as a route, while the Mainland is ided into eight routes. Up until this year, the decision on how, and when, to treat the road network in the winter months has relied upon the information received from two weather stations at the Mill of Rango in Sandwick and at Kirkwall Airport, basically covering the East and West, while this has been helpful, it was a very broad brush.“The system is being closely monitored by officers throughout the winter season with view to summarise its performance at the conclusion of the trial next year. This will determinewe want to adopt this technology on a permanent basis.”Stressing that road safety remains the top priority, she said:“I want to reassure our communities thatwe are treating areas of the West Mainland, but not parts of the East for example, we are doing this because we are confident – based on the data – that the roads in the East do not require it.”There are km of priority one roads in Orkney, km of priority two routes and km of priority three roads.In line with nationally recommended guidance, the council’s Winter Service Policy - points out that the network will be treated in the morning when road surface temperatures are predicted to be below C, and in the afternoon when they are predicted to be below C.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney.

Nobody would expect us to, he told Times Radio.He later told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme it was up to inidual businesses to ldquomake judgments on what is appropriate in terms of staff socials.ldquoIt slightly depends on the nature of the business. For many small businesses, four or five staff, who are working together every day any way, gathering to have a drink isnrsquot a big step up in risk, he said.ldquoBut some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world to a big party, and they may decide, this year, is that sensible given the pandemic and given where we are The boss of pub group Youngrsquos, which runs more than  sites across the UK, confirmed the business had seen some Christmas parties cancelled amid concerns over Omicron. vw,vw,px, px\"Criticising Government messaging regarding the iant, Patrick Dardis told PA news agency: ldquoI think the messaging has been terribly confusing and inconsistent.ldquoOne moment you have Jenny Harries telling people to avoid socialising and an hour later you have Sajid Javid saying the opposite.ldquoI think the messaging started as a complete over-reaction and, unsurprisingly, it has concerned some people.In a joint statement, UKHospitality, the British Institute of Innkeeping, and the British Beer  Pub Association urged those with plans ldquonot to cancel, with bookings down on previous years.ldquoThe full range of hospitality venues across the UK would usually be experiencing their annual bookings bonanza at this time of year, but it hadnrsquot materialised even before Omicron was first detected, the organisations said. vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoThe WHOannouncement that Omicron infections are generally mild, plus Government promptings for festive gatherings to go ahead as planned, offer a crumb of comfort, and could at least slow the slew of cancellations the sector has experienced in the week since Omicron was discovered.ldquoWersquod therefore urge those with bookings not to cancel them, but to carry on and enjoy their festive season parties, safe in the knowledge that hospitality venues are doing everything they can to ensure people have a safe and fun Christmas and New Year.Speaking on Wednesday, WHO Covid- technical lead Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said there had been reports of Omicron cases which ldquogo from mild disease all the way to severe disease, but stressed it was still early days.Royal College of Nursing Council chairwoman Carol Popplestone said Covid infections had already been on the rise before the new iant was discovered, and argued that ldquomixed messages from ministers over Christmas plans could create ldquoeven more worry and confusion.Meanwhile, a scientist assessing vaccines said his group is ready to move ldquovery quickly on deciding whether children aged five to  should be given a Covid jab in the UK.Professor Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , said it is waiting for approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencybefore making a judgment on whether vaccines should be offered.The MHRA is expected to rule shortly on whether the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is safe and effective in young children. The vaccine has already been approved for youngsters in the EU and US.But Prof Finn told BBC Breakfast there is a ldquolaw of diminishing s when it comes to young children, as they are largely protected from serious Covid-.It comes as the boss of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, Dr Albert Bourla, said annual vaccines to tackle Covid- are likely to be needed.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Yes, we have heard from the World Health Organisation that it may be a milder iant, but it affects people in dferent ways ndash people with underlying medical conditions can be impacted very seriously by Covid, and therefore we need to understand better what this iant means, and it is vital that we continue to follow the public health guidance.Ding dong merrily on high will be replaced this Christmas by ping-dong miserably we sigh.I will vote against new restrictions in Parliament today.They are not proportionate to deal with the spread of the mild omicron iant.mdash Sammy Wilson MPNovember , The DUP leader was asked about Mr Wilsonrsquos tweet, which read: ldquoDing dong merrily on high will be replaced this Christmas by ping-dong miserably we sigh.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity.

Mark BainTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailSchools have been urged to avoid further closures at all costs with children having already missed too much time out of the classroom due to the Covid pandemic.The call comes from the Commissioner for Children and Young People, who said all avenues must be explored so sending pupils home from school does not become normal practice.Some schools are already preparing new timetables to begin after Christmas, having warned parents that many children will face days off as the number of staff off through Covid-related issues continues to rise across Northern Ireland, saying the situation has become a serious health and safety concern.“We should not be in a position where whole classes or year groups are learning from home because of staff shortages, as is the case in some schools,” said Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma.“That situation is untenable and urgent intervention is needed so that children receive the education they have the right to.“I welcome some of the suggestions already offered to make sure this does not become the norm, such as calling in retired teachers and redeploying teachers that are not currently working in schools.“Some older children are undertaking both mock and full GCSEs. Many children, of all ages, are only now beginning to settle back into education in the classroom.I know that school staff, unions, the Education Authority and the minister all agree that further school closures must be avoided at all costs and I urge them all to make every effort, including exploring the above suggestions, to ensure that this intolerable pressure on some schools is alleviated and our children do not have their education further disrupted.“My ‘New and Better Normal’ Report highlighted the impact of school closures on children and yet again our children and young people are anxious about their education and the services that they receive in school. Closing of schools must be avoided, the impact is much too serious for our children and young people.”Read MoreNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolAll this week, schools have been reporting severe staffing issues, with principals unable to secure substitute teachers off the NISTR register, which all substitute teachers must be registered on in Northern Ireland.Some schools are making over  telephone calls a day to get classes covered, with over , teachers absent through Covid related issues in the last four weeks and the numbers rising every day.Helena Macormac, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, called on the Department of Education to expand the register for substitute teachers to help alleviate the situation.“We want to see them perhaps encouraging recently retired teachers to come back or incentivising teachers which are within other areas of the system, and asking them toto teaching,” she said.“There needs to be clear messaging from the department for parents and pupils and to let them know their school may be faced with this situation.”Teaching union the NASUWT added: “We are in this situation because teachers and support staff are catching Covid. Until a serious effort is made to stop the spread of Covid, more students will be sent home. At all costs, this has to be the first priority.“This means stopping all mass gatherings in schools now. Why are some schools still holding open days and parents’ evenings  Why are teachers kept on site after children have gone home for meetings ”The Department continues to urge schools to reinforce guidance available from the Public Health Agency, and said there remain no plans to introduce a series of circuit breaker school closures ahead of Christmas.“Departmental guidance requires schools to continue to implement a range of mitigations to reduce the risk of Covid- transmission including: cleaning, ventilation, face coverings, consistent groups and regular asymptomatic testing using lateral flow devices for all staff and post-primary pupils. Vaccination is available to all staff and some students.“Anyone displaying any of the key Covid- symptoms must not attend school. They should stay at home and book a Covid- test.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationMore On Department of Education PremiumNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolDisaster warning: Teaching union calls for December school ‘circuit breaker’ after , off with CovidDepartment reiterates its commitment to relationships and sex education review PremiumCovid-linked staff shortages creating ‘an absolute nightmare’ for principalsLiam Neeson’s pride as Ballymena’s first integrated primary opensMost ReadThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyLegal first in NI after Co Down man convicted of publishing photo of judge sitting in courtSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time school‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’Top VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayReformed former prisoner Rosie Bradley creates artwork for north Belfast cross-community boxing clubPlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and , new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageSinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill blasts ‘sinister’ bogus NI Covid restrictions messageCovid ‘no joking matter’ says DUP’s Donaldson over Wilson ‘ding dong’ tweetCoronavirus NI: Unvaccinated over s ‘four times more likely to die’ than those double-jabbedLatestSouth Africa accelerates vaccination campaign amid Covid surgeUp to , people in Northern Ireland ‘who pose sexual risk to children’Football Association to publish review of Euro  final chaos on FridayDUP leader to speak to colleagues over public health messagingCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and , new cases reported,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Today we have  teachers off. That equates to a quarter of our teaching staff.“Like all schools we have tried in earnest to secure substitute teachers to fill these positions to no avail. We have on several occasions, contacted over  subs on a given day to try to secure cover.“I have discussed the situation with the chair of Governors and we feel that we may have to go down the route that other post primaries are taking and ask that certain year groups stay at home on certain days.“We will be putting a plan in place in the new year. This is certainly not something we want to do and we have worked hard to avoid this so far this term but the situation is such that the measures we have in place are not sustainable with the current level of absence.”Helena Macormac, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, said contingency plans need to be in place, but we do not want to see a circuit breaker”. We would prefer itthat could be avoided, but safety has to be paramount. Be prepared is what we’re saying, but we really don’t want this to happen,” she added.But she added that “ there are not the substitute teachers in the system, then schools cannot open safely.”The Department of Education said: “There are no plans to close schools early for the Christmas period. Any decision to do so would be taken by the Executive and would be based on medical and scientic advice. We all know that the best place for children in terms of mental health, wellbeing and education is in school.”The Department said it “is aware of the pressures schools have been facing throughout the pandemic and the dficulties faced by some schools in securing appropriate cover as a result of staff absence”. We are actively considering how best to support schools in responding to the issues they currently face and are liaising with Department of Health colleagues while continuing to follow medical and scientic advice.”Related topicsThe Executive OfficeDepartment of EducationMore On The Executive OfficeReport on flags and culture just kicks can down road, says Long PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionFlags report a pointless fence-sitting exercise is a waste of five years and £kFlags report: Paramilitary flags and murals should not be displayed in Northern IrelandNew flag for Northern Ireland and bonfire enforcement among FICT report recommendations PremiumAnger of pub and bar owners as they blast Stormont for a lack of guidance over Covid certicate schemeMost ReadThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyLegal first in NI after Co Down man convicted of publishing photo of judge sitting in courtSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time school‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’Top VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayReformed former prisoner Rosie Bradley creates artwork for north Belfast cross-community boxing clubPlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and , new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling average‘Closing of schools must be avoided’, says Children’s Commissioner Koulla YiasoumaSinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill blasts ‘sinister’ bogus NI Covid restrictions messageCovid ‘no joking matter’ says DUP’s Donaldson over Wilson ‘ding dong’ tweetLatestCharlie Wyke says Wigan boss Leam Richardson saved his le after cardiac arrestDriver guilty of causing deaths of girl, , and man, , in crashLizzo discusses her friendship with ‘supreme a’ AdeleWatford boss Claudio Ranieri praises speed of response to medical emergencyCamilla opens boutique cinema with promise towith her grandchildren,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The survey found Northern Ireland to be the most charitable UK region, with more than three-quartersagreeing that it is better to give gts than to receive them. Eileen Wilson, Food Services Manager at Footprints, Northern Ireland, a partner of national food distribution charityFareSharesaid: “Christmas does bring extra challenges for people close to poverty or struggling with mental health. “Expenses go up this time of year. Not just trying to buy food and gts, but also heating in winter.” A campaign organised by the Big Give and backed by celebrities such as Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Russell Brandand others is aiming to help. The Big Give Christmas Challenge is the UK’s biggest Christmas coordinated fundraising appeal, supporting over  charities to raise funds with the unique offer of matching any donations made during the week of November  to December . This gives thehundreds of participating charities the opportunity to have their donations doubled. Alex Day, Director of The Big Give said: “Our study shows that, sadly, people across Great Britain and Northern Ireland are facing an imperfect storm high fuel prices, chronic mental health problems, rising debt, loneliness and fears about Covid- will mean that, for many, this festive period will be a far cry from picture perfect scenes portrayed on Christmas cards. “Some will rely on charities which will be further and further stretched as demand grows. “That is why, for those who can, supporting charities is more important than ever. Through The Christmas Challenge campaign, we are offering to match any donation made to hundreds of amazing charities throughtheBigGive.org.ukThat means whatever you can give will go twice as far.” The Christmas Challenge consists of many dferent charities, from small local organisations to large international charities.

My whole le came to a halt.Derry Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch aims to raise more awareness and funds for an “illness we don’t talk about enough” Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseReporter: Nicole Lang Dec   addthis, Leslie Hill was sadly diagnosed with Parkinsons disease in April . googletag.cmd.push Parkinsons disease is a condition that affects the brain. It causes problems like shaking and stfness that get worse over time. The main symptoms of the disease are shaking, slow movements and stfness. Treatments for Parkinsons disease include therapies to help with movement problems, medicines and sometimes brain surgery. Parkinsons disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It’s not yet clear exactly why this happens. Leslie’s first symptoms were shown in his handwriting when it was still neat but very small. Then, in January , the -year-old, was getting ready to go to the dentist when his left hand would not move to brush his teeth. Leslie said: “After several attempts to brush my teeth, I realised something wasnt right. I contacted my GP and was sent to the hospital to do tests. “I was kept in for five days and had numerous tests. It was then that I was diagnosed. My whole le came to a halt. “Shortly after, I became a member of Parkinsons Foyle branch. I really enjoyed and appreciated the support that I got. “I helped to organise events and helped with fundraising. I was a committee member within six months and then I was asked to become Chairman. “It is and was such an honour, I was very pleased to be voted in. I have a vice chairman, Jackie Brolly. “There is a committee of  dedicated members, nothing is a bother to them. My we Rhonda is the secretary and Wendy Stuart is treasurer. “We have approximately  members and we are all one big family. “I have been acting Chairman since September  and officially since March . During my time as Chairman, we have given approximatelyfive to six thousand pounds every year to Parkinson’s research.” Parkinson’s Foyle Branch is a self-funded charity and they depend on the generosity of members of the public to keep the branch going. Their mission is ‘Together we will find a cure, and improve le for everybody affected by Parkinson’s.’ Leslie continued: “We’re close to major breakthroughs. Funding the right research into the most promising treatments, we get closer to a cure every day. “Until then, were here for everyone affected by Parkinson’s. Fighting for fair treatment and better services. Making everyone see its real impact. “People with Parkinson’s, scientists and supporters, fundraisers and families, carers and clinicians, all working side by side. “We are impatient for change, we’re taking a stand, speaking out, chipping in, and playing our part. “I cannot thank the members of the public enough as they have been tremendous. We also organise events with the money we receive to help Parkinson’s patients. “This includes dancing to music, exercise classes, massage and reflexology classes, yoga and many more as exercise is a good medicine for Parkinsons sufferers. “In the month of March, we hold our Annual General Meeting. Then, from April to December, we have monthly meetings. “At our meetings,we have  plus members and carers and we have a guest at every one of them. “Our meetings came to a halt in March  due to the Covid pandemic, the whole world had stopped due to this deadly virus. “With our dedicated committee members, we rang round all of our members and kept in touch. The Mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke is attending the Foyle Branch’s Christmas Dinner on Friday December  to celebrate all the member’s efforts during this dficult period. Leslie concluded: “I want to speak about and raise awareness for Parkinson’s because you don’t see a lot about it on the news and not many people know about this illness but, together, we will beat Parkinson’s.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

However, Phase Two of the stadiums redevelopment has yet to proceed.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Aontuacute councillor, Emmet Doyle, has demanded Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey to stop dragging her feet in progressing Phase Two of the redevelopment of Derry City FCs Brandywell Stadium. googletag.cmd.push In  a new  seater stand incorporating changing rooms and media facilities was completed at a cost of poundmillion. That brought the existing capacity of the ground to around . However, that was supposed to be part of wider development at the stadium with a second phase increasing capacity to . Cllr Doyle, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, expressed concern that Phase Two has yet to proceed and following a meeting with the Department of Communities, he said his was “dismayed” and “frustrated” at the lack of progress. He said: “A number of months ago I called for a meeting between Council and the Department to understand the level of progress made in progressing the Sub-Regional stadia programme which is currently holding up Phase Two of the Brandywell. “I am dismayed following the meeting that no time-frame has yet been set for the opening of the funding programme, and indeed the Department has not even set criteria. “Engagement has taken place with clubs and officials which is positive but this programme first opened a decade ago, and yet we are still waiting for movement despite it being part of New Decade New Approach. “I am massively frustrated that we are still at this early stage and the Minister needs to step in before the Assembly election next year to deliver on what was a programme that has raised the expectations of fans throughout the Council area.” Cllr Brian Tierney of the SDLP echoed Cllr Doyles concerns and accused Sinn Feacutein of failing to deliver. He added: “It’s extremely frustrating that the Department for Communities are unable to give us any indication around funding for the second phase of redevelopment work at the Brandywell Stadiun. “Over five years ago Sinn Feacutein told us this funding was guaranteed and the party’s Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey seems to have abandoned this promise.  “The Brandywell is an important community hub in our city, it’s not just used by our football clubs, but the general public and is open to everyone. The first phase of the redevelopment was a massive success, it delivered a modern stand for fans, a new greyhound track and much improved facilities. The second phase is now long overdue. “With fortunes changing for the better for Derry City on the pitch there could be no better time for Minister Hargey to recommit herself to this project. There is a new-found feeling of optimism around the club and we need to capitalise on this. “If we wish to bring more fans through the turnstiles then we have to be able to offer an experience befitting a modern football match. “Time and time again Sinn Feacutein have made promises to the people of Derry, but failed to deliver. We need the minister to get this funding scheme open so we can get a timeframe in place for this redevelopment work. “I will continue to press for action until our city has the stadium it deserves.” In response a Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The Minster is actively considering the outcomes of the refresh and re-engagement exercise undertaken in relation to the Sub Regional Stadia Programme.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The Foyle MP will formally move the second reading of his Climate Emergency and Green Jobs Bill which aims to bring forward the date by which the British Government must achieve net-zero emissions to . Climate Change is the greatest threat our world faces, and we have ten days to legislate to save our planet. On th Dec, I’m bringing my Climate Change Bill to the Commons with progressive ideas to do our part to arrest the slide into climate catastrophe. #ClimateChangeBill pic RDOeSu     — Colum Eastwood December ,     The Bill also places a duty on Government Ministers to bring forward proposals for a corporate green levy on large businesses to resource climate action. Eastwood said global leaders have failed to grasp the chance to take action on climate change. “Over the last number of months, senior British Government Ministers have been at pains to establish their green credentials ahead of and during the COP conference in Glasgow, he said. While global leaders failed to grasp the real opportunity to take the bold action needed to prevent climate breakdown, the commitments made over that fortnight were substantial.  A unique opportunity - Irish public invited to share views on all-island rail network    Now Conservative Ministers have the opportunity to prove that Glasgow wasn’t all hot air and grandstanding for the world’s media. “The Bill I have produced alongside environmental leaders would signal a step change in this government’s attitude toward climate action and demonstrate that this is an emergency. I am proposing bringing forward the date by which net-zero emissions must be achieved to , introducing the first legislative climate emergency declaration and seeking the introduction of a new corporate green levy recognising that the burden for paying for climate rehabilitation should fall on those companies that have done the most damage. “Passing this Bill would be the first real demonstration that this government acknowledges that the house is on fire and we need to do something about it now. This legislation is radical because we cannot afford to be timid in the face of an emergency like this. I hope that political leaders will commit themselves to it in the days ahead.”  Foyle MLA Delargy accuses Poots of dithering on climate change     *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  One hundred years ago this week, the Anglo-Irish Treaty to determine the future of Ireland and its relationship with the United Kingdom was signed at Downing Street after tense negotiation. The final outcome would have profound consequences for the city of Derry who would find itself relegated to border town status once the creation of the Northern Irish state loyal to the UK had been established. The Irish negotiators in London were Arthur Grfiths, Michael Collins, Robert Barton, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy. On the British side was David Lloyd George, Lord Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Sir Gordon Hewart and Sir Hamar Greenwood. What followed was the creation of the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. The British would also retain use of three ports – Berehaven and Spike Island in the south and Lough Swilly in Co. Donegal. A common assumption was this Treaty resulted in the partition of Ireland with six counties being formed as Northern Ireland and would remain part of the United Kingdom. However, partition had already been put into place on paper with the Government of Ireland Act in  with it taking effect on May , . All the Anglo-Irish Treaty did was give the devolved, and predominantly unionist government of Northern Ireland the option to opt out of being part of the new Irish Free State – which they duly exercised. But partition was not an idea born out of a hurried idea to provide a compromised or botched solution to the Irish Question. As Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University reveals, the seeds of it had been sown long before Michael Collins sat down to negotiate with Lloyd George. He said: “One hundred years ago, the issue of partition was on everyones minds in Derry and the North West. “It was first mentioned in the nineteenth century as a solution to, what was called at the time, The Irish Question – the idea that Ireland would be self-governing. “Obviously there was major opposition to that in Ulster from the unionist population. So the idea that partition may be a solution with Ulster being under Westminsters control while the rest of Ireland would be under a Dublin government really began to have an affect on Derry in the early part of the twentieth century. “Especially around the years  and  when Ulster unionism began to mobilise physically in terms of protests, the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Forceand the signing of the Ulster Covenant. “That really had a major impact on the North West – and Derry in particular. There was an eleven-year period then from  to  where partition was in the position that kind of like Brexit is today in that in the last five years or so it was the only thing that people were thinking about. “It did have an acute effect on Derry – particularly around  and , Derry was the centre of attention for the partition question because it was seen as the place most likely to see violence emerge as a result of those political discussions. “But of course everything changed following the outbreak of the First World War. After the war, isions became even more entrenched and violence became a reality instead of just a prospect.” While the British Government continued to hesitate over Home Rule for Ireland, Republican volunteers took matters into their own hands in  by launching the Easter Rising. Ultimately, this attempt to win independence from the British failed and the rebellion was crushed. However, the question of self-determination did not end with the execution of the risings leaders and a growing political force by the name of Sinn Feacutein more than made its mark with a stunning performance at the  General Election. The party went from only having six seats to  – including the constituency of Derry City. Dr Grant added: “The thing about the Derry parliamentary seat is that it was a swing seat – a bit like today with the Fermanagh and South Tyrone Westminster seat. “The Derry City seat was so contentious because most men had a vote in parliamentary elections but not in local elections – an issue that remained controversial right up to the early s. “With the parliamentary vote, nationalists and unionists were evenly split in terms of the voting rights in the city. So election results tended to go unionist-nationalist-unionist-nationalist throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century. “So it wasnt a huge surprise when Sinn Feacutein won it in . But at the same time, it was always very close and there was huge media attention on it because it was so close. “The big thing in  was that the Irish Parliamentary Partyand Sinn Feacutein made a pact in Ulster that meant Derry was kind of pre-decided almost for Sinn Feacutein. “The IPP pulled back and gave Sinn Feacutein a free run at Derry but they would have got free runs themselves where such as West Belfast for example when Sinn Feacutein pulled out there. “Cardinal Michael Logue – who was the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland – brokered a pact between Sinn Feacutein and the IPP as they were afraid that they would knock each other out in seats like Derry and West Belfast and let the Unionists in to sweep up the seats.”  Read more: When unionists lost control of Derry Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  With Sinn Feacuteins electoral success in the Derry City seat in  General Election, nationalists turned their eyes on local government. The running of affairs within Derry had been in the control of Protestants Unionists since the days of when King James II unsuccessfully laid siege to the city in . However, the introduction of a proportional electoral system for council elections had been introduced prior to the  local government poll – the result of which was seismic for Derry. A coalition of Sinn Feacutein, the Nationalist Party and an independent Nationalist councillor, Hugh ODoherty, won control of Derry Council from the Unionists by just two seats with ODoherty himself being appointed Mayor of the city. Not surprisingly, the result caused resentment amongst the Protestant and unionist community which spiralled into the Derry riots of June . Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “The riots of  in the city are interesting in that while partition had been on peoples minds, serious violence had not occurred in the city since  .   “The  election was signicant in that it was a landslide for Sinn Feacutein and the whole country changed politically. So there was a fear on the part of unionists of an independent Ireland. “But to my mind, the most signicant thing was the  local elections in January of that year. “The unionist minority in Derry had held control of the city since the siege in . So theyve had two hundred or so years of dominance. “Because of the introduction of proportional representation, for the first time ever, the nationalists and Sinn Feacutein took control over local government after winning a combined majority of just two. “That in turn meant the Mayor of Derry, Hugh ODoherty, was both a nationalist and the first Catholic to hold that position since . So that was a hugely signicant and symbolic event because it meant that control of local government had been taken out of the hands of unionists and into those of nationalists. “That was hugely important politically because all of the conversation in ,  and into  was about would there be partition  andthat was to happen, where would the line be drawn . “If Derry Corporation was under nationalist control, then the propaganda victory and the moral argument would have tipped the balance towards the argument that Derry should be a Free State city rather than a Northern Irish one. “So unionists were very nervous and scared of their futures because of those signicant changes that took place. Weekend by weekend throughout the year, there was violence, rioting and fighting in the streets that became more and more intense. “You had events in the south with IRA attacks and counter-attacks from the Black and Tans that made things in Derry even more intense and then it all kicked off one night in June . “It spiralled from the Diamond into the Fountain area followed by a counter-attack from the Bogside and by the end of the week, there were twenty people dead – a really, really terrible week in the citys history.”  Read more: Derry the centre of attention in Partition question Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

This week marks the centenary of The Anglo-Irish Treaty that would see Derry in a precarious position in its bid to be part of the new Irish Free StateReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, This week marks the th anniversary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish Treaty. In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  The riots that took place in Derry in  eventually came to a close but tensions in the city were still on a powderkeg. While Sinn Feacutein held the Derry City Westminster constituencyand a Nationalist coalition in control of both the citys Council and the Mayors office, events where would decide the future of Derrys fortunes. Partition of the Ireland had been an idea since the nineteenth century but it became a reality late in  with the Government of Ireland Act. The bill meant that six of Irelands counties would form the state of Northern Ireland to be run by a devolved – and predominantly unionist – administration in Belfast. May  saw the enforcement of the Act and it left Derry cut off from the rest of Ireland – especially from the trade it had with neighbouring Co. Donegal. Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “Partition – on paper – took place as a result of the Government of Ireland Act in . That piece of legislation allowed for the creation of two separate parliaments of two politically jurisdictions – Northern Ireland in the six counties and Southern Ireland in the  counties. “Northern Ireland was founded with the unionist political establishment ran the legislation to establish a parliament, set up a police force and put into place the whole mechanisms of a government.  Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University  “Whereas in the south, the whole concept of there being a Southern Ireland never really took hold because it wasnt accepted by nationalists or Sinn Feacuteiners as a solution to the issue. “So essentially, the Government of Ireland Act was just ignored. The Southern Irish parliament was never founded which meant the  counties were in a state of limbo while Northern Ireland was being founded. “It was only when the Treaty negotiations took place that the concept of the Free State of Ireland came into play. “Though it had taken place on paper, actual partition didnt take place until after the Free State had been founded. “With the partition on paper, the news of that did not go down well at all with Derrys nationalist community. “I think that once that happened, it was just a matter for them to try and keep their heads down and use the power that they had gained in the local elections earlier in  to try and argue for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “There was a twin-strategy. The ultimate outcome would be a united Ireland that was independent – whether it would be a republic or not would be another point. There was a feeling that the IRA and Sinn Feacutein could achieve their aims and there would be no worries about partition and treat it asit was something to be ignored. “Others probably more realistically thought that partition was going to happen whatever the outcome was. For those nationalists and republicans, their strategy was to argue forcefully in the press and in the political circles for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “They went out mapping, interviewing people throughout the potential border area to ask their opinion on where they would like to reside and put out the message that Derry was a nationalist city and should not be included in Northern Ireland. “They also wanted to keep control of local government so they could continue to make that point.” While nationalists in Derry went about arguing their case, Michael Collins himself was planning a campaign of destabilisation to collapse the new Northern Ireland and have Derry and the North within the Free States fold. However, events close to home would prevent that. A turn that would have profound consequences on Derry for decades to come.  The second and final part of “Derry and the Anglo-Irish Treaty”, will be in next Mondays edition of The Derry News on December .

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A satisfied James McNicholl shted back and forth underneath the Owenbeg stand, trying to shake the effects of an hour and a half on the sideline in Storm Arwen. googletag.cmd.push His Dungiven side had just sealed back-to-back Jack Cassidy Cup titles with a win over Loup and with the howling wind muting the celebrations slightly, he had his eye on the future. “Hopefully we can get a springboard from this into senior football,” he told the County Derry Post. “We won in , and any momentum we would have got was halted with Covid and obviously that was more important at the time.  Derry GAA vice chairman Kieran McKeever presents the Jack Cassidy cup to Dungiven joint captains Darragh McGilligan and Cahair Higgins. Pic by Mary K Burke. “Weve four or five starting on the senior team there and most of the  lads are senior footballers now. There is plenty there to work with over the next couple of years. “[With Geoffrey in] its exciting times for the players and you know theyll buy into it. The talent is there – its always been there, but sometimes other things get in the way. “We are where we are as a senior team, thats the way the league tables are, and hopefully now well kick on and in four or five years time well be back in that conversation further up the table.” Despite a Carl Lagan goal bringing the deficit to just one in the second half, McNicholls St Canices side looked controlled and composed throughout the encounter. McNicholl said the elements had ruined the game as a spectacle, but that his side had a plan for managing the situation. “We got settled down at half time. We were a wee bit nervous and passes were going astray in the first half, but I thought we controlled it really well after half time,” he said.  Dungiven master the elements to seal back-to-back Jack Cassidy titles  A late Niall McGonagle penalty stretched the winning margin to five.   “There was such a big breeze in the first half the conditions dictated the game to be honest. Its nearly too big a breeze at times we were kicking the ball out of play and that. “Look, we worked on it, weve done it in training, so it was a matter of taking it from the training field onto the pitch.” “Its all about patience. We work hard on isolating one-on-ones and getting at your man, andyou cant do that in Gaelic football, you shouldnt be in the team. “The spaces will always open up at some point, it was a very defensive first half from them, and rightly so, they were facing a big breeze. “We knew theyd be there in the second half, but it just takes a bit of time. You get a bit of luck as well, but they knew they had it in them,” he added.

Pic by Kevin Morrison - Event Images.Reporter: Gary Ferry Dec Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Alan Reynolds has been unveiled as Derry City’s new Assistant Manager. googletag.cmd.push The -year-old had been at Shelbourne last season, splitting his time between there and the FAI where his Development role included assisting the national under- side. Reynolds had a previous spell at the club back in - under Stephen Kenny and he admitted he felt he had unfinished business at the Brandywell. “I’m not sureI ever thought I would arrive back here but it is a club I have a good affinity with,” he said. “I really enjoyed my spell here in  and . At times I felt like it was unfinished business that I would end up here at some stage because of the relationship I had with some of the people up here. I’m delighted to be here, it’s a new challenge and there’s a lot expected from us, but we’ll embrace that and enjoy it.” City boss Ruaidhri Higgins took his time deciding on his number two and feels he has now got the right man for the job. “Alan is a fantastic coach and it is important for me to have someone of his quality and experience here,” he stated. “He knows the league inside out and will have the trust of the players, which is key. He’s been here before which always helps as well, and he will bring plenty of ideas and energy to the club. “We are comfortable with where we are in our preparations for the new season and are looking forward to getting going again in the coming weeks. ”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Reynolds had a previous spell at the club back in - under Stephen Kenny and he admitted he felt he had unfinished business at the Brandywell. “I’m not sureI ever thought I would arrive back here but it is a club I have a good affinity with,” he said. “I really enjoyed my spell here in  and . At times I felt like it was unfinished business that I would end up here at some stage because of the relationship I had with some of the people up here. I’m delighted to be here, it’s a new challenge and there’s a lot expected from us, but we’ll embrace that and enjoy it.” City boss Ruaidhri Higgins took his time deciding on his number two and feels he has now got the right man for the job. “Alan is a fantastic coach and it is important for me to have someone of his quality and experience here,” he stated. “He knows the league inside out and will have the trust of the players, which is key. He’s been here before which always helps as well, and he will bring plenty of ideas and energy to the club. “We are comfortable with where we are in our preparations for the new season and are looking forward to getting going again in the coming weeks. ”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in .

I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland.

Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too. Jamie Ferguson and Matthew Nelson also battled hard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Dunleath parkrun plans edging closer  ","story":"DETAILS of Downpatrickrsquos first ever parkrun event are being finalised, it has emerged.Dunleath Park is being lined up to host the event and while no date has been confirmed, it is hoped that it will take place next year after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to provide financial support to organisers.The exact level of local authority support is currently being finalised and it is hoped that once the date of the K event and the venue have been formally confirmed that the parkrun will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, the proposed Downpatrick parkrun also has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last.Last month, the Town Committee issued an online appeal for ldquoenthusiastic and committed volunteers to come forward to help get the parkrun up and running and itrsquos hoped that the parkrun could become a weekly event and attract people from across the district to enhance their health and enjoy the great outdoors.Downpatrick area councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed the progress on establishing a parkrun event at Dunleath Park.He said parkruns have become popular with runners and walkers alike across the country and keen participants in the Downpatrick area have been planning the establishment of a similar event in the county town.Cllr Sharvin confirmed that he recently requested an update from Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities department on the progress of establishing the parkrunand providing financial support to the group setting up the event.ldquoI am happy to report that the financial contribution and approach has been agreed between all stakeholders and officers are working with the parkrun organisers to finalise the details, he said.ldquoWith this great news, it should not be long until we have our first parkrun event in Downpatrick, utilising the new trail around Dunleath.Cllr Sharvin added: ldquoA parkrun will also bring people from outside the area into Downpatrick spending locally in our shops and cafes, adding to our great array of social and leisure activities on offer.News that Dunleath Park could host the parkrun comes after recent confirmation that major investment is planned for this part of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is planning to create a series of new facilities, including a dedicated running track, while also in the pipeline are a cycling pump track, skateboarding track, improved planting and a new play park.In addition, soccer and GAA pitches are in line for an upgrade as part of the plan to transform Dunleath Park into a sporting and recreational hub.Itrsquos understood that the area earmarked for the proposed pump track, skateboard track and play park sit outside the parkrsquos floodplain and will enable the local authority to move faster in putting a business case together and progress towards securing capital funding.The need for new G or G pitches mdash which can be used all year round mdash at Dunleath Park also been highlighted with council officials asked to investigate the potential for this particular investment to happen..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  December 5%2C 2001

unveiled a number of buildings at High Street which have been transformed in the project which was funded by the local group and the International Fund for Ireland.Killyleagh Development Association chairman Professor Bob Elwood officially received the keys for the buildings from developer Maurice Crawford during a ceremony on Friday afternoon.Professor Elwood confirmed that both apartments in the scheme had already been let, while a cottage at the top of the street had been sold.Four shop units are also available and Professor Elwood said the association was in negotiations with business people about potential projects.ldquoIt was essential that this area was refurbished and renewed in an effort to bring new businesses and new people to the town, he said.ldquoAlthough these buildings are new, they have been designed to blend in with the rest of the street which is Georgian in style.Former Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne said he was proud to have been invited to open the new facility.ldquoOut of all the people that could have been asked to this, I find it was great honour that the community has given me the opportunity to perform this , he said.ldquoYou only have to go back to the beginning of the year to know that this area was an eyesore and to see it now I can hardly believe the transformation that has taken place.DOWNPATRICK ndash One of Downpatrickrsquos oldest bars is in line for a major improvement scheme which could top the pound, mark.Rearsquos Hotel in Lower Market Street has been bought by two local businessmen who plan to turn the property into one of the districtrsquos top entertainment attractions.The plans, which include a major refurbishment programme, will transform the current building which in its heyday was at the centre of attraction in the town centre.Brothers Mark and Bartley Murphy are confident the major investment will result in premises on a par with the very best Belfast has to offer and say the venture will be successful.Once the refurbishment programme has been completed, Rearsquos will serve food all day and there will also be aroom which will be hired for private parties and other similar s.ldquoThe aim is to provide a facility which willbe high class and top-of-the-range and the level of investment reflects this, said Mr MarkMurphy.ldquoThe premises have been bought and work to transform them could start early in the New Year.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Lions Club have recruited the help of high school students in the town to launch their annual Christmas food appeal on behalf of the needy.Pupils from Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos were on hand recently to back Lions Club president Eddie Russellrsquos appeal for pub lic support for this important service to the community.This weekend, members of the Lions Club and their supporters will be on duty at shops and supermarkets in the area asking local people to contribute to the appeal.Mr Russell said the Lions Club is inviting shoppers to purchase one or more items of non-perishable food and place it in the trolley or basket provided.ldquoAt the end of the collection, the Lions will sort out the food into hampers for the needy and these will be distributed in time for the festive season, he said.ldquoThe Lions believe that at this time of year, many people in the community are anxious to support those who are perhaps not quite as well off as themselves and this project is an ideal way of doing so.SPA ndash A Spa musician is preparing to launch her first CD. Isabel Keenan will publicly unveil lsquoGo in Peacersquo, a compilation of sacred music, at a special event in the Arnold Hall, Spa, on Friday, December , at pm.The guest artists at the special concert will be Crawford Bell and Ivan Black.

It was events there  years ago that led effectively to the foundation of the Free Presbyterian Church.A dispute concerning the attendance of the Rev Ian Paisley at a gospel meeting resulted in a number of leading members of Lissara Presbyterian Church breaking away to form a new congregation.On March , , Crossgar Free Presbyterian Church held its first service in the Killyleagh Street Mission Hall.

From the resulting kick-out Carew won possession before sending over a mammoth effort to put the Johnnies back in the ascendancy.With both teams displaying huge work rate, the challenge for the Johnnies was to play through the Fontenoy press and find space.Ryan Morganrsquos pace, and incisive angled runs were a crucial factor in carving a way through a Fontenoy backline that was being well marshalled by Queens Universityrsquos Niall McElroy.Cope and Madine combined to create an exceptional team score in the th minute, but the Fontenoy response was swt and the energetic Eoin OrsquoHare burst through to raise the green flag in the next phase of play.Caolan Burns and Eoin McCrickard kept the scoreboard ticking over with well taken frees for their sides.A key battle within the game was that of Johnnies centre half Oran OrsquoConnor against Michael McMullan. OrsquoConnor was readily available each time the full back line of Aaron Murphy, Adam Walsh and team captain Rory McMullan gained possession.McMullanrsquos brave block from a Shea Moorehead effort in the th minute typied the spirit within this young Johnnies team, his cousin Conor McMullan claimed the resultant rebound and found Cope who won a late free on the far sideline.From fully  yards out, Ryan Morgan launched a majestic effort that found its way to the Fontenoy net to leave just one score between the teams.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13261456.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hence it is that effective opposition to the protocol is severely compromised because the DUP are not willing to sacrice their idol in defence of the Union.

The prime minister, the EU and pan nationalism know this and so treat Jeffrey Donaldson’s threats as no more than empty, hollow rhetoric. They are as void of meaning as Arlene Foster’s “blood red lines” and Nigel Dodds’ “precious Union”. The stark reality for unionism is that the DUP are as much an obstacle to the removal of the protocol as are the EU and pan nationalism.If as unionists we really want to remove the protocol I suggest we must first begin by voting the DUP out of office.

Photo: Liam McBurney PA Wire“Sinn Fein in  denied unionist MLAs the opportunity to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary by laying a simple stone or planting a rose bush in Stormont. Sinn Fein snub the Royal Family [and are] unable to even mark the Duke of Edinburgh’s passing in the same way as other countries.“Such cultural and identity weaponisation will make solutions very dficult to come by as some want cultural domination rather than respect.”Sinn Fein chairman Declan Kearney said that publishing the report without an implementation plan was a “mistake” and called for “an orderly implementation” of its deliverable proposals, PA reported.The report said that many “challenges remain” surrounding flags, bonfires and memorials. There has already been criticism that the -page report, which has cost approximately £,, is not accompanied by a plan for implementing its recommendations.The commission was set up in  to find consensus on a number of contentious issues, but devolution collapsed before it could deliver a report. Its findings were submitted to the first and deputy first ministers last July, and were finally published yesterday. It made  recommendations but it is unlikely they will be enacted. There are  commissioners, including seven from political parties and eight independent members, overseen by Professor Dominic Bryan.On the issue of flying flags on lampposts or other street furniture, the report states: “The commission could not agree on whether changes should be made to current legislation in order to create a similar exemption to that which exists for election posters. “Consequently, without any legislative changes, the commission is not in a position to recommend a code of practice that would accompany any such legislative change.”The report also said there had been “no meeting point” reached on the flying of flags at public buildings. Nor could commissioners agree to take an audit of the number of memorials – mainly paramilitary related – on public land or buildings. The report said that flags supporting paramilitary organisations should not be flown.The commission also discussed the possibility of developing a new civic flag to be “representative of the ersity of our society”.On bonfires, it recommended that the Executive recognises “that they are an important aspect of the culture, identity and tradition of communities and are therefore a legitimate form of celebration or commemoration, provided they are compliant with the law”.The report finally recommended that an Executive action plan was produced on how to implement its recommendations, and to explore unresolved issues.First Minister Paul Givan said the the report had considered a range of complex issues. He added: “It is right that the public have a chance to see the report and have their say, and today’s publication will allow them to do that.”Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The FICT report examines a number of sensitive issues across our community. Addressing these issues is an important part of moving our shared society forward and I put on record my thanks to the commission for their efforts in undertaking this challenging work.”TUV leader Jim Allister said little had been agreed, and so it was “a colossal waste of money”. He said it was clear that some within the media are intent on using ideas that were “discussed but not agreed – such as the preposterous suggestion that the Irish tricolour would be given parity on buildings – as the basis to frame public debate”.Speaking in a personal capacity, PUP deputy leader John Kyle said that any report without an action plan will simply gather dust. “This report, which contains some credible and valuable recommendations, will be a waste of time and public moneythere is no implementation plan,” he added.Sinn Fein’s Mr Kearney said: “I would much rather see scaffolding established in order to ensure an orderly implementation of those proposals within the report that I believe are deliverable.“There are then clearly challenges which remain, butwe had had a framework of next steps then we could tackle those.“It is for the parties who oppose the good sense of an implementation plan to speak and answer for themselves.”SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said the first and deputy first ministers sat on the report for  months before MLAs compelled them to publish it. These issues go to the heart of isions, she said, which was far too important to allow the document to become “an £, ornament” at Stormont.Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson said loyalists should be very attentive to the outworking of any regulation flowing from the report. He said: “It is not about enhancing culture, it is about strangling it – slowly but decisively – via carefully constructed regulatory architecture which is superficially attractive, and often buttressed with financial incentives, but which is ultimately culturally corrosive.”#MORE NEWS:Flags report: ‘Belfast-centred focus on flags that ignores rural victims concerns’A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We got agreement through all the political parties on these issues.”On the failure of Stormont’s Executive Office to publish the report until now, Dr Bryan said: “I can’t speak for why the Executive Office haven’t been able to get it through but there are quite a lot of complexities going on here around the cultural area — including two new language commissions being set up, the setting up of an office of identity and cultural expression which was in the new deal new approach, and all of this stuff has been going forward.“And all of this is in the mix so, in fairness to them [the Executive Office], there are quite a lot of complexities into how you move this forward.”Dr Bryan also said the report had sought to find ways to enable, rather than restrict, “cultural practice”.“If you look at bonfires, for example, they are surrounded by a whole lot of legislation which is really nothing to do with the celebrations and commemorations which bonfires are part of,” he said. “And they sort of get in the way.“So this report is starting to look at the legislative areas and we are suggesting ways that will enable cultural practice.“We haven’t set out in this to stop anybody doing anything. Actually, contrary to that, we look at ways people can be enabled to do things within the law.”He said there was “less progress” on the topic of flags in public areas.Dr Bryan added: “With the flags on public buildings, that is the one area of all of our chapters where I think we got less progress and I think we are all disappointed at that.”Justice Minister Naomi Long has accused Stormont’s Executive Office of a “complete failure of leadership” for failing to “drive forward” progress on the report.The Alliance Party leader, speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, criticised the absence of a plan to put the report’s proposals into practice.She said the long awaited report had now been “abandoned”.She also slammed the long delay in publishing the report, which was given to the Executive “nearly two years ago”.“I think it’s absolutely scandalous that £, was spent on a report that we have had to wait almost two years to see,” she said. “We were told it would be published with an implementation plan.”She continued: “I’ve been writing to the Executive Office and my party’s had a debate in the Assembly on this in March, asking that it be published with an implementation plan so that we could start to take up some of those themes, and where there wasn’t agreement try to find agreement and where there was agreement try to implement it.“Instead, it’s now just being orphaned with nobody taking responsibility for it, which I think is absolutely scandalous.”The minister added: “These are issues that affect people’s everyday lives - bonfires, flags, paramilitary trappings on buildings, all of those things that people are constantly concerned about and raise with us regularly. Instead of taking political leadership and trying to drive a programme of work to address them, this is now simply being abandoned.“Unfortunately, I did say at the time of the Haas talks that that might well be the outcome which was one of the reasons we were very lukewarm on the outcome of those talks.”On whether the report’s findings would be put into practice by the devolved administration, she said: “It certainly doesn’t seem to be going to be implemented by the Executive Office.“We will seek to try to drive forward some progress where we can on that report as a party.“But obviously it should be being done on a cross-departmental basis, and it should be driven forward by the Executive Office. It’s a complete failure of leadership on their part.”South Belfast DUP MLA and lead member on the Executive Office Committee Christopher Stalford welcomed the publication of the report.Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Report.“The public should now give its views,” he said.“The answer on these matters is mutual respect but it is hard to come by when Sinn Fein campaigns to remove every trace of Britishness from Northern Ireland. “Sinn Fein in  denied unionist MLAs the opportunity to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary by laying a simple stone or planting a rose bush in Stormont. Sinn Fein snub the Royal Family. Unable to even mark the Duke of Edinburgh’s passing in the same way as other counties.“Such cultural and identity weaponization will make solutions very dficult to come by as some want cultural domination rather than respect.“We are complex society drawn mainly from the British Isles. A mix of Irish, English, Welsh and Scots. Some of us are British, some are Irish, some are Northern Irish and there are new and emerging identities.“I will always defend the dignied display of the flag of my country but I will never make excuses for the display of anything that could be associated with a paramilitary organisation. I will always promote the celebration of culture but I will never support anything which glories terrorism or promotes violence. I trust every Party will arrive at a similar position.”Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson said loyalists should be very attentive to the ultimate outworking of any regulation. “It is not about enhancing culture, it is about strangling it- slowly but decisively- via carefully constructed regulatory architecture which is superficially attractive, and often buttressed with financial incentives, but which is ultimately culturally corrosive,” he said.“The purpose of all of these things is to neutralise, and by extension diminish, PUL culture and traditions. The ‘process’ requires the incremental dismantling of the Union, and a key part of that is stage by stage watering down expressions of British and Unionist culture and sovereignty. “This is never more evident than in the FICT proposal for a civic flag. This requires unionism accepting that the sovereign flag of the United Kingdom should not fly, and instead should be replaced by a neutral flag. That of course therefore means further dilution of visible manestations of our sovereignty. “If the  Agreement was a settlement rather than a process, then that settlement should respect the primacy of sovereignty and expressions of same. “The way forward on flags and bonfires in voluntary regulation schemes whereby loyalist communities would self regulate. Any engagement with statutory schemes, in the context of the cultural war whereby statutory bodies are often nationalist soldiers in that battle, would be foolish and self defeating. “You can not regulate culture. I should say however that the proposals for education in terms of Human Rights and the Law is a valuable proposal. PUL communities have been frozen out of the legal arena, and there is a signicant disconnect. In contrast, nationalist communities have very successfully weaponised the law to advance their political objectives. Unionists and loyalists must build the capacity to engage in this kind of lawfare, rather than being confined to the sidelines.”Read the full report here.MORE NEWS:When is Spoty wrapped  How to find your data and who is expected to be the most streamed artist of  A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
