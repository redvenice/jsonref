But this will only be achieved if drivers are supported to charge their vehicles typically at off-peak times.‘Support for drivers using their electric vehicles in novel ways will also be needed, for example by “vehicle-to-grid” technology to share energy from car batteries back to the electricity grid when it is needed.’ Ofgem envisages the number of electric vehicles will surge from 230,000 today to ten million by 2030 and 39million by 2050. It argues this will only be possible if the current total of 30,000 public car chargers rises to 210,000, plus 3,500 rapid and ultra-rapid chargers near motorways.         It is suggested that building and running the infrastructure to support the roll-out of electric vehicles could be £2billion a year, equivalent to £30 on every household bill (stock image)At the same time, traditional natural gas central heating and hot water systems will have to be ripped out of millions of homes.These will be replaced with electric heating and, potentially, a new gas system run on hydrogen, where the only emissions are water.The regulator said: ‘The future of heating is less certain, with a range of possible different pathways to decarbonise.‘In 2017, just 4.5 per cent of the energy used for heating the UK’s 29million homes and other non-residential buildings was from a low-carbon source.‘This number needs to rise significantly by 2050.’ Ministers should consider charging farmers per ton of carbon produced by their land, a report released by wildlife charities has said.

He was invited there by a curator whose stipulation was that he make work on the theme of sex and mortality.“Mexico’s anarchic, visceral energy got under my skin and sucked me in,” he recalls. “There is an acceptance that life has no glorious victory, no happy ending. Humour, ritual, a strong sense of community and an embrace of the inevitable make it possible to live with tragic and often unacceptable situations.”Hugo’s approach shifted accordingly to reflect the flamboyance and gritty ordinariness of life there, his images filled with vibrant colours and often mysterious symbolism. This portrait is a case in point. Entitled The Wedding Gift, it shows a young bride in Juchitán de Zaragoza cradling an iguana, a creature considered a symbol of patience, understanding and kindness in Mexico. Conversely, the elaborately competitive mating rituals performed by the male of the species – head-bobbing, nudging, biting and even changing colour – have been mimicked in local song and dance, including a famous traditional ballet, La Iguana de Guerrero.Whatever the symbolism, the young woman seems perfectly at ease holding a lizard in her lap, her direct-to-camera gaze giving little away. Hugo is also noncommittal, refusing to reveal her age or comment on what he calls “the iguana tableau”. From the start, Hugo’s work has been characterised by degrees of ambiguity: his most famous series, The Hyena and Other Men, shot with an itinerant troupe of street performers and their captive beasts in Nigeria. His approach, which merges documentary, street photography and staged portraiture, has led to accusations that he exoticises, even exploits, his subjects, though his photographs are often created through sustained creative collaboration with his sitters.In his Mexican portraits and landscapes,about to go on show at a London gallery, the mood moves between the heightened everyday and the grotesque: weatherbeaten peasants in work clothes, a woman dressed like Frida Kahlo, corpulent nudes, blood-covered faces and a man wearing a crown of thorns. Nothing is ever entirely what it seems, the complex nature of Mexican culture reflected through an outsider’s eyes as a mixture of ritual, role-playing and various degrees of exaggerated reality. “I am drawn,” says Hugo, “to the fabulousness of the banal and the banality of the exotic.” In Mexico, he found his perfect location.Pieter Hugo: La Cucaracha is at Huxley-Parlour Gallery, London, W1 from 19 Feb to 14 Mar"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e0bdc978fb5ca3c01b7517699c6177f1bdfbf4/124_549_3136_1882/master/3136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b3fe824e1e71f807392d9294991bb14","title":"florence nightingale show to shine a light on her later years","story":"Exhibition marks bicentenary of nursing pioneer’s birth with focus on life after Crimean warAn exhibition on Florence Nightingale which marks 200 years since her birth will shine a spotlight on her as an older woman.Nightingale is often pictured in her 30s, when she nursed wounded soldiers in the Crimean war.The exhibition, in the museum that bears her name in the grounds of St Thomas’ hospital in London, aims to also remember the triumphs of the more mature woman.Nightingale became known during the war as the Lady With the Lamp because she would check British soldiers throughout the night.The Florence Nightingale Museum exhibition will explore the next 50 years of her life, when she revolutionised nursing and transformed healthcare.She also suffered physical illness and depression, now thought to have been post-traumatic stress disorder.Highlights will include her famous lamp – a Turkish lantern she carried during the war – and a recording of Nightingale’s voice when she was in her 70s.Other items include a photograph showing her in bed at the age of 86, four years before she died at the age of 90, her medicine chest containing glass jars of homemade remedies, and her writing case.The design of St Thomas’ hospital was hugely influenced by Nightingale and it opened the first Nightingale School for training nurses in her honour in 1860."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45234b3b1af10050d4a2c35f84f41f4101f80a40/108_351_4498_2699/master/4498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04b53f540e86df536bd727998c779870","title":"original observer photography","story":"Steve McQueen, Bill Nighy, Julia Fox, Big Narstie and more – the best photography commissioned by the Observer in January 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a640072dc35b6a552a89dee8a30fe726828650a/0_188_4308_2584/master/4308.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef604aad99f28c68552ec3024ad30fb8","title":"the water dancer ta nehisi coates review","story":"Magical realism meets real life in the acclaimed journalist’s debut novel about American slaves escaping to the northA former national correspondent for the Atlantic magazine, Ta-Nehisi Coates is among the most revered and widely read intellectuals in the US. His bleak but scintillating book about race, We Were Eight Years in Power (2017), was a passionate collection of essays focusing on the sharp isions and overpowering emotions – from uplifting to ugly – that surfaced when Barack Obama became his country’s first black president. What white America fears most is black competence, Coates reasoned. Black excellence turns that fear into paranoia.Coates alerted readers to his talents two years earlier with the National Book award-winning Between the World and Me, a letter to his then 14-year-old son in which he warned about the perils of being African American. It was acclaimed by Toni Morrison, who celebrated Coates as the long-awaited heir to James Baldwin.Like Baldwin, Coates’s elegant nonfiction is haunted by the dark legacy of the American civil war. Little wonder, then, that slavery is the subject of his first novel.In common with Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad, which draws on the life of Harriet Jacobs, an enslaved woman who hid for years in a low-ceilinged attic in which she couldn’t stand, The Water Dancer makes use of a number of real-life narratives. For one, there are parallels between the protagonist, Hiram, and the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Born in Maryland to a raped, enslaved woman whom he barely remembered after she was sold to another plantation, Douglass was a child prodigy, famous for his extraordinary biography Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, which told of his escape from slavery to become a great orator and an advocate for emancipation.Born on an antebellum plantation in Virginia named Lockless – whose community consists of the Quality (masters and mistresses) and the Tasked (enslaved) – Hiram is also the son of a slave master and slave, Rose, who is sold “down river”, leaving Hiram orphaned. Like Douglass, he is an exceptional child who has a gift for remembering everything. Everything, that is, except his own mother.As a cultural analyst, Coates is noted for his stylish prose, but in The Water Dancer the writing is spare. Hiram considers slavery “a kind of fraud, which paints its executors as s at the gate, staving off African savagery”. Sophia, a fellow slave, who admires Hiram’s intellect, dreams of escaping with him: “We could go together. You are read and know of things far past Lockless.”The book’s title refers to an African folk tradition where women on plantations balanced jugs of water on their heads while dancing. In Coates’s telling, theirs is a ritual of remembrance, of the possibility of slipping the shackles of slavery, if not bodily then spiritually. Lockless’s dancers are the reincarnations of those captured Africans who managed to flee the slave ships by wading into the water “to sing and dance as they walked, that the water-goddess brought ’em here, and the water goddess would take ’em back home”. This fable-like quality informs much of the book.As The Water Dancer progresses, it is increasingly shaped by the real-life saga of William Still’s The Underground Railroad Records (an 1872 book comprising the stories of slaves who escaped). Coates’s focus is on the strategies of the network of abolitionists who engineered passage of the enslaved from the “coffins” of southern plantations across the Mason-Dixon line to freedom in the north. Having nearly drowned and been buried under a river, dug himself out, been recaptured and escaped again, Hiram joins forces with another character, the actual abolitionist Harriet Tubman, whose daring rescues feature prominently. Like Tubman, Hiram is blessed with a supernatural gift called “conduction”, triggered by powerful emotions and enabling him to travel great distances.The description of conduction is The Water Dancer’s greatest strength – the author’s method of fictionalising the mystery of Tubman’s out-of-body hallucinations.During episodes of stress (especially when helping others escape plantations), Hiram, too, is a passenger in his own body. Distances collapse as the Underground Railroad agents travel back in time and jump into the future, the “jump” achieved by the power of their stories: “It pulls from all our lives and all of our losses. All that feeling is called up, and on the strength of our remembrances, we are moved,” says Hiram.In The Water Dancer Coates is attempting his own conduction – to make the terrible past real for modern readers. As Hiram says at the end of the book: “To forgive was irrelevant, but to forget was death.”Colin Grant’s most recent book is Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation (Jonathan Cape). • The Water Dancer by Ta-Nehisi Coates is published by Hamish Hamilton (£16.99).

After spending a year watching dog films, Mitchell believes animals on screen should be recognised more, and calls on Bafta and the Oscars to have a best animal award category. She describes how dogs provoke emotions in humans, but their own feelings are “magic” when captured on film, citing the mutt in the 1974 classic Benji whose “big brown eyes” could show so much. “Even that old curmudgeon Alfred Hitchcock confessed he was a big Benji fan,” she says.Citizen Canine: Dogs in the Movies is out now (£12.99, Laurence King)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cabb63d8d6e794bf6d3711fe9b4af03a2137fec1/0_6_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b147258be72737687a8f11870a6743a0","title":"uk productivity slowdown worst since industrial revolution study","story":"Researchers found slowdown from the pre-2008 growth trends almost four times that of 1930s The slowdown in Britain’s productivity growth over the last decade is the worst since the start of the Industrial Revolution 250 years ago, a dismal track record that is holding back gains in living standards across the country.Research from academics at the University of Sussex and Loughborough University shows that the productivity growth slowdown since the 2008 financial crisis is nearly twice as bad as the previous worst decade for efficiency gains, 1971-1981, and is unprecedented in more than two centuries.Growth in productivity – a measure of economic output per hour of work – has failed to rise in Britain at anywhere near the rates recorded prior to the banking crisis, with severe consequences for living standards. Economists believe productivity growth is vital for lifting GDP and higher wages.Prof Nicholas Crafts and Prof Terence Mills, among Britain’s foremost economic historians, said productivity growth had been dragged down by a combination of three problems: the lasting effect of the 2008 crisis for the financial system weaker gains from computer technologies in recent years after a boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s and intense uncertainty over post-Brexit trading relationships sapping business investment.In a research paper to be published in the National Institute Economic Review this week, they warn there has been no previous point in UK history when these three phenomena occurred in such a short space of time.Crafts said: “It has been shockingly bad. Brexit then comes along towards the end of this 10-year period. Obviously we’ve not yet seen the ultimate effects on trade costs, but it’s undermined investment and erted a lot of managerial time to contingency planning, rather that what you would think of as more productive activity.”The 2010s are also almost four times as bad as the Edwardian “climacteric” and the depression of the 1930s. The climacteric – a term used by economic historians to describe a period of low productivity growth at the turn of the 20th century – occurred between the end of the age of steam and the widespread adoption of electricity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df19df17d293d3c9dca2d0e5554e2474daf9d184/0_215_6449_3869/master/6449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf617e219f136f37eb250ba25a4aa607","title":"guardian new readers editor journalism fairness accountability","story":"The organisation’s commitment to great journalism, fairness and accountability will continue to be nurtured and protectedAs I write this first column in my third week as the fifth  readers’ editor, I am still in learning mode.

I’m only slightly embarrassed to say I needed a diagram to see how all the moving parts fit together in 2020.  journalism happens every minute of every day, over at least a dozen platforms, from its publishing centres in London, New York and Sydney.As well as the website (with four editions), three print titles and three apps, there are podcasts, documentaries and social-media feeds. From Instagram posts to the long read, from Today in Focus to a video explainer such as Sarah Boseley’s on coronavirus that has been watched more than 7m times in the past 10 days, the “readers’” editor is clearly here for listeners and viewers too.What doesn’t change are the values, and what shouldn’t change are high standards. It hardly needs spelling out how much trust in news matters – a commitment to accuracy, fairness and accountability is owed to those who read it and those who are written about. Public admission of errors may not be pleasant for those behind them (I still burn hot over slips I have made), but ultimately it assists rather than hinders good journalism.As readers’ editor I report directly to the Scott Trust rather than the editor-in-chief, so that I can consider comments, concerns and complaints from a position of independence. I sit physically in an office just off the London newsroom, but figuratively I sit halfway between you (wherever you are in the world) and the journalism. My priority must be complaints under  News \u0026amp Media’s editorial code – an updated version of which is in progress – but our desk also handles corrections, and feedback, and promotes your voice to editors.I am also learning that the vast majority of emails, letters and phone calls (about 32,000 a year) are from people being helpful in picking up small mistakes, or sincere in raising a serious concern. Sometimes a writer also appears in the inbox to report, unprompted, an inaccuracy in their own work. That is the system working.As I begin, I make five pledges:1. I start from a position that all complaints are made in good faith – and equally that no journalist comes to work to mislead or mistreat readers2.

Although the Murdoch media make it seem as if there’s plenty of debate, the reality is that most Australians I talk to get it.And why shouldn’t they? More carbon pollution means warmer temperatures which dry out the landscape, making it easier for fires to spread. The fact that the bushfires tore through Australia as we ended the hottest decade ever recorded is no coincidence.But those opposed to climate action have tied themselves in knots trying to fool the public into believing that it’s really environmentalists and arsonists at fault.Yet it’s hard to sell denial when people are busy fleeing the flames. It’s tough to distract from the reality of climate change when plumes of smoke dim the sky, and when every breath of soot-filled air stings your throat. As one climate scientist colleague put it in response to the almost-biblical fires bearing down on Canberra: “This is a stark reminder that climate change seems gradual until it is on your doorstep.”That’s precisely what happened to Jeremy Wright, a Rotary Club member who came to a lecture I gave the other day at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney. Wright lost much of his family farm that has been around for 180 years, outside Milton in south-east NSW where the Australian author Henry Kendall was born. The bridge that provides access to the farm burned and he lost a herd of steer, several vehicles and his farm shed. Climate change is no longer just a theoretical construct for Jeremy.Despite the tragedies playing out around the country, I’m hopeful we’re hitting a tipping point. Not a physical one – which we will hopefully avoid, where the global climate undergoes dramatic, irreversible and catastrophic change – but a psychological one.Here and around the world these fires appear to be pushing us toward a tipping point in public consciousness, a mass recognition that we must act.But there has always been a disconnect between what the public knows and what their elected leaders choose to do. Ruling political parties in Australia, the US and Britain are particularly intransigent, their denial driven by ties to fossil-fuel interests and bolstered by the Murdoch media’s steady drumbeat of denial.It’s something I’ve noticed quite clearly in my time here. The Australians I’ve talked to about climate change seem well aware of the science, are very concerned about reducing emissions and, most of all, are frustrated by their leaders’ unwillingness to take meaningful action.For years, fossil-fuel-funded voices have taken to Rupert Murdoch’s media outlets to tell the public that climate change isn’t real, or it won’t be a problem until years from now, at which point we’ll all be so rich we can just buy our way out of trouble. They told the public to ignore climate scientists who are ringing the planetary fire alarm, that all is well despite the increasingly stark warnings from those who have devoted their lives to studying the issue.Sadly, despite criticism from within the Murdoch empire, and even from Murdoch’s son James, the promotion of denial and delay continues unabated. “Warming is good for us” read the headline on Andrew Bolt’s column in the Herald Sun the other day to widespread derision as climate change-fuelled bushfires continue to engulf the continent. The headline on Paul Kelly’s column in the Australian read “Any climate policy change is going to be slow burn”, with no apparent sense of irony.But telling people to ignore the fire alarm doesn’t work so well when they can feel the heat, with flames consuming their country and with so much smoke it’s made a full circuit around the globe.We won’t know if this will be a tipping point for the public’s demand for climate action until we have the benefit of hindsight. But people will have an option: to vote out politicians in denial, and vote in candidates who are honest about the issue.Perhaps we shouldn’t call it a tipping point, but a flipping point.Then perhaps she’ll be right, mate.• Michael E Mann is distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University.

Which means them critiquing the posh archetypes we’re all sick of and then driving away in a fancy car.It’s the gift no one asked for: one minute plus of the “All People Are Tax People” remix, complete with a erse cast of knee-shakers, sign language, a beat drop and a promise to “get deductions, get deductions, make sure you’re not missin’ nothin.’”The show which singlehandedly (and controversially) brought back a 19-year-old McDonald’s condiment (Szechuan sauce, we’re talking Mulan promotion 1998 here) is trying the same magic on Pringles, with a typically dark twist.Filing alongside celebrities at the Super Bowl who aren’t football-related:Three entirely serious questions: what is Avocados from Mexico? Why is Molly Ringwald playing a home shopping network host here? And where can I buy this chip floatie?Our reporter Lauren Gambino is at a Bernie Super Bowl event and has this to say:Bernie Sanders has never been a football guy. Baseball is his sport. The Dodgers are his team — that is the Brooklyn Dodgers (before they moved to Los Angeles in 1957).Nevertheless he turned up at Igersoll Tap in Des Moines on Sunday night for what he half-heartedly referred to as a “Super Bowl thing.”It was a watch party for all his supporters and volunteers on the eve of the Iowa caucuses he is well positioned to win and the last event of his campaign before voting begins here on Monday night.The venue smelled like barbecue sauce and buffalo hot wings (of which there were both). The floor was sticky with beer (likely a permanent state). And the TVs were muted (an accommodation that seemed to unsettle the wait staff who might be among the few people in the bar who could definitely name both teams in tonight’s game.)Sanders arrived with the “future First Lady” and some of the the “future first grandchildren.” He remembered that some of his children’s children were back in Vermont. Four, he thought. Five, his wife Jane corrected him. “Oh we have another one! I didn’t know,” he said grouchily as his supporters roared with laughter. “Math is not my strongest suit,” he added before ing into an abbreviated version of his stump speech, attacking Trump and vowing a political revolution. “Tomorrow night,” he said in closing, “is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump. When he finished, Sanders left the building to catch a flight back to Washington, where his presence is required in the impeachment trial of the president he hopes to have the chance to replace. Oh and this happened:And then this:Busy Philips, Lily Singh, Taraji P Henson and real-life astronaut Nicole Stott don spacesuits for Olay’s #MakeSpaceForWomen campaign, a “mission” which launches 2 February. The campaign is intended to increase opportunities for women in Stem fields and for every Super Bowl Sunday tweet of the hashtag, Olay has pledged to donate $1 (up to $500,000) to Girls Who Code.It is a truth universally acknowledged that at least one Super Bowl ad per year must make fun of Boston accents, and in 2020, the honor goes to three Massachusetts natives: John Krasinski, Rachel Dratch, and Chris Evans, dropping r’s left and right in service of Hyundai’s Smaht Pahk. If you’re a fan of the phrase “wicked hahd”, a quick tour of Boston geography (Dorchestah? Foxboro? The Gahden? Revere?

It’s Winona Ryder, returning to her namesake town of Winona, Minnesota (where she was born in 1971), for the website-building company Squarespace. Approached by a stereotypically spare and unassuming Minnesota cop, she reveals that she is building a website for the town (“It’s got pictures on it!” she shouts). That site does exist and true to her word, there are pictures on it, as well as the explainer: “I was born on a small farm on the outskirts of Winona, Minnesota. Dad tells stories of a shoelace and umbilical cord, but I don’t know how true that is. Regardless, Winona is my origin point, in more ways than one.”Or, a revision of The Shining, in which Cranston, Jack Nicholson, takes an axe to the bathroom door to offer Tracee Ellis Ross a bottle of Mtn Dew Zero. The spot promises it’s all “as good as the original, maybe even better?” and to be fair, Bryan Cranston as the Shining twins is … not an easily forgettable image.Snickers has come up with a way to fix the world and it’s by feeding it a giant Snickers and then making an ad about it and using Luiz Guzman as their celebrity spokesperson. Since the world officially lost its way in 2016, I’ve heard worse ideas.One of the most anticipated ads of the game gives us a closer look at Marvel’s belated solo adventure for Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow. It’s not a great deal different to the trailer that already launched but it does reintroduce that wonderful “warped guitar” noise as well as remind us that Oscar nominee Florence Pugh is starring in a big old blockbuster so it’s hard not to love it.In an ad touting “out-of-this-world convenience”, Walmart grocery pick-up is visited by a slate of extraterrestrial and sci-fi characters: Buzz Lightyear, Bill \u0026amp Ted, the creatures from Arrival and characters from Flash Gordon, among others (the Star Wars contingent got lost on another planet). Shout out to the Lego Movie guys for carrying a blue bag five times their size.Jennifer Lopez’s boyfriend and actual baseball legend Alex Rodriguez is there and will surely be cheering her on come half-time. The pair also threw a pre-game party on Friday night in Miami.“You know Alex. He’ll be as close as he can get to that stage!” she said. “Alex and all of our kids will be watching, they’ll all be in the stadium.” The task ahead for Quibi, the much-hyped short-form content service developed by former DreamWorks head Jeffrey Katzenberg and Hewlett-Packard chief Meg Whitman, is steep. The service, which will launch in April, promises “quick bites, big stories” and boasts a slew of talent, from Sophie Turner to Chance the Rapper’s Punk’d reboot to Oscar-winning director Guillermo Del Toro. But whether it can get content-saturated audiences to pay for shows and movies in installments less than 10 minutes long – or, as its bank heist commercial claims, get “quibi” to stand for a unit of time – is very much an open question.The full-length version of tonight’s Super Bowl spot has a lot for us to take in. Vin Diesel has a brother! That brother is John Cena! Charlize Theron is back! And she’s in a perspex cage! There’s a magnet plane or something! Whatever that is! How did we get to the ninth Fast \u0026amp Furious film? Does that make any rational sense? Do we all still want to see this when it comes out in the summer? Yes!And you can see Demi Lovato’s rousing National Anthem here:The film that’s almost kind of just about maybe almost been happening for decades now is finally coming out this summer. A sequel to a hit that didn’t seem like it needed a sequel but here we are, months away from the release of Top Gun: Maverick. It’s the first previously unreleased film ad tonight and it offers what we might expect and little else – but here’s hoping it proves its existence by the time June comes.A necessary insertion here from Disney, continuing the cartoon-to-live-action machine with Mulan, arguably its riskiest bet so far. It’s a genre switch-up of sorts, with the film set to be more of a historical action adventure, a far cry from the more easily-marketed-to-kids magic of Disney’s previous efforts. The latest tease promises again to bring us some rousing sequences though and a vital reminder that not all Disney heroines are waiting for a man to save them.And the game is about to begin but who cares about that. What we do care about is that Demi Lovato is singing the National Anthem. She’s all dressed in white and acompanied by music that often threatens to overtake her voice but as she gets further into it, she manages to dominate with a pretty flawless performance. It certainly lays down quite the gauntlet for anyone else singing later tonight ...Tonight’s National Anthem will be performed by Demi Lovato, a solid choice given her proven track record of singing rather brilliantly live. Also she’s done it before. Also she predicted she would do it 10 years ago which isn’t not weird:There have been a couple of warring protests outside the stadium in Miami and not from groups you might expect to see. Firstly, residents protested about the pollution and noise that F1 racing would bring to the city and secondly, activists from Bloodstained Men, a national nonprofit that lobbies for an end to circumcision, made their voice heard. Even if you’re not watching the game or even if you’re barely paying attention to it, this is something everyone can take part in:Fox scored an exclusive Super Bowl interview with a man who hates giving interviews and generally keeps his thoughts to himself, which is one hell of an exclusive, huh?Here he is complaining about how hard his life is. Again:While it might not have brought the political edge many had hoped for, Lady Gaga’s energetic 2017 Super Bowl performance brought pretty much everything else, including flawless vocals. At a Miami concert on Saturday, she delivered a messagewarning to JLo and Shakira: “I better hear no lip-syncing tomorrow!” Let’s see if the pair have Gaga to answer to in the morning.It’s the Super Bowl! But also it’s the Super Bowl? For those less interested in the game and more interested in more important things like how good JLo’s dancing is, this is the place to stay.There will be no talk of football or whoever is playing whoever and how good that kick was or whatever. Instead there will be everything you need to know about all the pop cultureness of the evening, from the big half-time performance from Jennifer Lopez and Shakira to the ads to the celebrities in attendance to whether we might get another terrible surprise Cloverfield film at the end.So make a big dip and stick with us. If for some reason you’re weird and you actually do care about the game then you can follow that here instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee955a2f6605438799d680e77273d959b78b7d7f/0_232_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef56ac5fc79dc59dab1b78cc0c71e91b","title":"overwhelmed prague tries to limit airbnb to curb tourism","story":"Joining a battle already being waged by many other cities, the Czech capital’s mayor wants new laws to limit the lettings websiteFor decades, its mesmerising blend of baroque and gothic beauty was closed to mass tourism by the iron curtain that ided the communist east from the capitalist west during the cold war.Now Prague, which has gained an unenviable reputation as a destination for stag nights and pub crawls, has become the latest European city to propose a radical assault on Airbnb and other short-term letting platforms as over-tourism threatens to overwhelm it and drive out residents.Under plans pushed by the city’s liberal mayor, Zdeněk Hřib, property owners would be barred from leasing out entire flats except when it was their own home and they were temporarily vacating it. Tourists demanding Airbnb rentals would be limited instead to single rooms in accommodation where the owner also lived.Speaking to the Observer in his office in Prague’s new city hall – near the heart of the tourist district – Hřib, a member of the Pirate party, said the idea was the focal point of a scheme to “give Prague back to the people of Prague” and mitigate the negative effects of tourism.He said Airbnb’s growth had turned the city, once the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and later a jewel of the Habsburg monarchy, into a “distributed hotel” and that failure to regulate it was “eating the city from inside”.“In the past, you could limit the amount of tourists in the city simply by approving a certain number of hotels of certain capacity during the process of building permits,” said Hřib. “Now in Prague there is no possibility for the city to limit the accommodation capacity for tourists. The numbers are really critical.”Nearly 8 million tourists flocked to the city – total population, 1.3 million – in 2018, up from 2.6 million in 2000, numbers that are expected to keep rising and which Prague’s infrastructure and finances are ill-equipped to cope with.The increase has accelerated as Airbnb has consolidated its presence, transforming previously sleepy residential districts into busy zones characterised by foreign visitors with tell-tale wheeled suitcases in residential blocks.An impact report from the city’s institute of planning and development said the number of Airbnb outlets almost tripled from 5,537 in March 2016 to more than 13,000 in May 2018, representing a jump from 17,913 to 52,738 in the number of beds. Eighty per cent of available rentals are entire flats.The result has been an increase in noise and disturbance to long-term residents and soaring property values and rents that have priced locals out of the housing market. An average Prague resident needs to pay 14 times the annual salary excluding tax, housing, eating and clothing costs to buy a flat in the city, the mayor said.Meanwhile the council has faced a widening financial shortfall as the nominal local tax levied on owners, some of whom live outside the Czech Republic, often goes unpaid and fails to cover the costs of the growing strain on resources and services.“This is far beyond the original idea of the shared economy where you are supposed to let a tourist stay in your home, you cook the breakfast and you tell them something about your nice city,” Hřib said. “This is just a distributed hotel, where you abuse the comfort of other citizens in the city, the local residents, and seek your own profit at their expense.”The European court of justice recently ruled that platforms like Airbnb were “information society services” rather than estate agencies, making them harder to regulate.Hřib plans to overcome this by persuading the Czech regional development ministry to back legislation allowing local authorities to issue their own laws and decrees on short-term holiday lets according to local conditions. Similar efforts have previously failed, but the mayor insists that the growing awareness of Prague’s problem has generated enough political support for a law to pass.Apolena Rychlíková, a film-maker and journalist who has campaigned against the unfettered growth of short-term lettings, welcomed the city council’s proposal, “after five years of ignoring the problem”. She added: “As a resident of the centre of Prague, I feel like a stranger in my city every day. And I’m not alone.”Janek Rubeš, a creator of the Honest Guide, a YouTube channel documenting the effects of over-tourism in Prague, said Airbnb’s evolution had harmed the city’s neighbourhoods. “These Prague apartment blocks aren’t made for tourism. Tourists have different needs from locals,” he said.“They need a 24-hour reception, where they can get into buildings when they need to. It doesn’t work like that on Airbnb. It was a great idea at first, but not the way it is now.”Prague is not alone in its stand against Airbnb. Last month, the council joined 10 other cities - Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Bordeaux, Brussels, Krakow, Munich, Paris, Valencia and Vienna - in signing a letter calling on the European commission to update its laws. “These short-term rentals are primarily for tourists at the expense of locals and families who want to live and work in our cities,” the letter says.Some of the cities have imposed their own limits on the platform and similar outlets. In January 2019, Amsterdam tightened its rules on rental of entire homes to fewer than 30 days, from 60 days.In Palma, Mallorca, authorities went further, issuing a ban in 2018 against almost all short-term Airbnb-type rentals of flats on the island, after local residents had complained of a sharp rise in rents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed4e2d987c9b1a633f33d2789d38b6642368d7cf/0_1222_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccaebf85f7d3e28c939e541d8bd8c329","title":"why sushi could be the solution to a sea urchin invasion aoe","story":"The ravenous creatures are destroying vast swaths of kelp forests, which are crucial for carbon storage. Is the answer staring us in the plate?Eating as much sushi as humanly possible seems an unlikely way to help save the planet. But one company is hoping fine diners from London to LA to Tokyo will devour enough uni sushi – sea urchin roe – to help restore the planet’s kelp forests.From the North Sea to Tasmania, large parts of these underwater carbon stores – crucial for bioersity – have vanished, leaving vast “urchin barrens” on the sea floor in their place. In Norway, the expanses of bizarre, prickly orbs are green. In California, they are purple. But wherever the urchins linger, the problems are the same.Once the voracious echinoderms run out of kelp to eat, they do not simply die. Instead, they can stay in stasis for years, billions of them starving in their shells. This makes it impossible for the kelp forests to recover, unless the urchins are removed entirely.Urchinomics has a plan for that. Their idea is to turn the hordes of urchins around the world into a business opportunity by collecting them, feeding them up on sustainably harvested, umami-rich kombu seaweed and selling the lucrative roe to high-end sushi restaurants.“My first ‘a-ha’ moment was a year after the tsunami in eastern Japan,” says Urchinomics CEO Brian Tsuyoshi Takeda, remembering conversations with Japanese fishermen in the aftermath of the 2011 disaster.“When the tsunami hit, it washed away all the predator species that used to be in the water. When the predators disappeared, the urchins exploded in population. The scientists told us it was about seven times the original biomass in a year or two. They literally ate all of the giant kelp forests which were the foundation of the north-east fisheries in Japan.”According to Takeda, who is based in Norway but has operations in Japan, Canada and the US, Urchinomics has ambitions to make urchin removal and restoration self-sustaining around the world. Demand for uni, the Japanese name for urchins, is rising, and they were named one of the top food trends in 2018.“The more you eat urchins, the better it is for the kelp forests. That’s kind of unique, I think … It has to be about looking towards these win-win situations where you’re creating some sort of economic incentive to help drive the restoration work.”The company has just announced it has signed a lease to open its first urchin ranch in Norway, where 80 billion of the creatures are estimated to have ravaged kelp forests along the country’s coastline. Takeda hopes the site in Stavanger, the oil capital of Norway, will supply Michelin-starred sushi restaurants in in London, Amsterdam and Brussels this summer.The ability of kelp forests to recover once urchins are removed is impressive, taking mere months. But the problem of urchin barrens is not restricted to Norway.The disintegration of these vital underwater ecosystems caught researchers by surprise, and left a trail of economic destruction. In 2018, a $44m (£33m) recreational red abalone fishery closed after the kelp deforestation triggered mass mortality in the sea snail.“Our kelps are very productive ecosystems but they rely on the cool. We know that they are at risk in a warming ocean in a warming globe,” explains Dr Laura Rogers-Bennett from University of California, Davis, who recently published a study on how a sea-star wasting disease, a marine heatwave and sea urchin boom combined to collapse the bull kelp forests. In central California, the destructive armies of purple sea urchins have spread south to Monterey Bay, according to Jan Freiwald, head of the Reef Check Foundation, which has been training recreational ers to perform scientific surveys on ecosystems for over two decades. Yet the presence of sea otters might be helping the resilience of kelp forests.“About half of the sites we monitor have lost the kelp, the other sites are remaining strong. More recently, some have recovered,” he says.“One big difference between Monterey Bay and northern California is that we have sea otters. The sea otters are one of the keystone predators. They can keep the sea urchins in check. And so, actually in the kelp forests around Monterey, we see increases in sea urchins but also see the sea otters beginning to forage more on them. So that might sustain some reefs, rather than the northern coast where we don’t have sea otters.”Previous research has found that where otters are present, kelp forests tend to store more carbon and are healthier. But simply introducing otters into urchin barrens would not work as the starving shells are of little calorific value to the mammals.Whether or not Urchinomics manages to make it as a viable business, researchers warn that vast stretches of kelp forests along the Pacific coast are disappearing and the urchins must be cleared. Eating uni might be one way to save these precious marine ecosystems.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ec674e6a24c9db74ba7a94c8cc77034b6d7aed/0_123_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc2b31f091ae5ddb39c4bd6155cb1877","title":"wild grey seal caught clapping on camera for the first time","story":"The sound resembles ‘shotgun-like cracks’ and attracts potential matesA wild grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) has been caught “clapping” on camera for the first time, making sounds that resemble “shotgun-like cracks”.The large male was filmed striking its flippers together off the coast of the Farne Islands, near Northumberland, during the breeding season in 2017.While captive seals can be seen clapping in zoos and aquariums, scientists say this is the first time one of their wild counterparts has been caught on camera performing the action.While humans clap to applaud or express approval, in the case of wild grey seals , this gesture signifies quite the opposite.Scientists believe male seals clap to demonstrate their strength, as part of an attempt to ward off competitors and attract potential mates. The action produces a “loud high-frequency noise”, sending out “a clear signal” to other males in the area.In the video, the male seal can be seen swimming close to a female, with other males lurking nearby, before it starts clapping.Dr Ben Burville, a researcher at the University of Newcastle, who took the footage, said: “The effect of the clap was instant and the rival males rapidly dispersed.“The clap was incredibly loud and at first I found it hard to believe what I had seen.”Burville, who had been trying for many years to capture clapping seals on camera, added: “I’ve heard the distinctive shotgun-like cracks many times over the years and I felt sure this clapping behaviour was the source, but filming the seals in action has eluded me for 17 years.”The video is part of an international study published in the journal Marine Mammal Science.Dr David Hocking, from Monash University in Australia, who led the study, said: “The discovery of ‘clapping seals’ might not seem that surprising, after all, they’re famous for clapping in zoos and aquaria.“But where zoo animals are often trained to clap for our entertainment – these grey seals are doing it in the wild of their own accord.”The researchers say understanding more about grey seals and other marine life could help protect the species against the harmful effects of pollution.Hocking added: “Clapping appears to be an important social behaviour for grey seals, so anything that disturbed it could impact breeding success and survival for this species”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab5376d98dcabaa9d0328f88a92c36b0b051b14/0_0_3256_1955/master/3256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d42b74a773d3eb95423dcba7b74885f2","title":"host uk does not have clear vision for last ditch climate talks","story":"Campaigners are increasingly concerned country lacks clear strategy for Glasgow summitDeveloping countries and climate campaigners are growing increasingly concerned that the UK lacks a clear strategy for hosting vital UN talks on the climate crisis, amid fears of a conflict of interest in government between seeking post-Brexit trade deals and a global climate settlement.Boris Johnson will lead prominent British figures from climate science, business and economics to launch the UK’s strategy for the conference, known as COP26, on Tuesday. The talks, to take place in Glasgow this November, are widely seen as the last realistic chance for countries to pledge the stiff cuts needed in greenhouse gases to stave off climate breakdown.But the strategy was plunged into confusion on Friday night as the intended leader of the talks, former energy minister Claire O’Neill, was abruptly sacked.Her sudden removal, by the prime minister’s adviser Dominic Cummings, has left a vacuum that the government said would be filled by a minister.While some observers were encouraged that a more heavyweight politician than O’Neill could take the stage, there were concerns that if responsibility for the negotiations is taken on by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, that will mean the same officials and politicians who are trying to sign post-Brexit trade deals will also be trying to persuade recalcitrant governments to renew their commitments to cutting carbon.The potential conflicts of interest were clearly illustrated at the UK-Africa summit less than a fortnight ago, when Boris Johnson boasted of ending UK funding of coal-fired power plants in Africa – though there had been no such funding since 2002. But at the same conference, nearly £2bn of investment was poured into African oil and gas.The head of one major international NGO said civil society groups were “not convinced” that the UK could skirt the potential conflicts of interest. “It is very delicate and it’s going to be very interesting to see how they do this.”The media will be largely excluded from Tuesday’s launch, apparently at the behest of Downing Street. That is unusual, as the UN’s climate change secretariat is sensitive to being seen as open and transparent.Forging a global consensus on urgent action on the climate will not be easy. The Paris accord of 2015 marked the first time that rich and poor nations came together resolving to hold global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably 1.5C, which scientists say is the limit of safety.The Paris pledges to curb carbon emissions are inadequate, however, and at COP26, governments must scale up their ambition, or face climate breakdown within the decade. The most recent round of talks, in Madrid in December, were fractious and ended in only a partial agreement, showing little of the spirit of cooperation that will be needed to make COP26 a success.Other developing countries told the  that the sacking of O’Neill was “at best disruptive” but that if Johnson took swift control and appointed a political heavyweight who could inspire confidence in global capitals, the damage could be limited.There were concerns over O’Neill’s handling of the negotiations to date, as O’Neill appeared to downplay the importance of the Paris agreement and gave conflicting opinions of what should be achieved at COP26.O’Neill had already embarked in recent months on a busy programme of meeting environment ministers and negotiating teams from around the world. She attended the last UN talks in Madrid in December, and went to Dhaka to see Sheikh Hasina Wazed, Bangladesh’s prime minister, who will play a pivotal role in the talks as leader of the Climate Vulnerable Forum group of 50 countries. Those meetings will need to be replicated and relationships rebuilt after her departure.He added: “The sacking of O’Neill seems to be a setback which they can only rectify by quickly appointing a political heavyweight to replace her. Hopefully they will do so.”At Tuesday’s launch, Johnson will showcase the UK’s advances in renewable energy, its leadership role as one of the first countries to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050, and the City of London’s power as a global finance centre to pour billions into greening the global economy. He will hope that these are enough to restore any doubts caused by the stormy start of the UK’s year as hosts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b12998869b2f61817641bb95b33816aec4e033e/0_26_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdca07954d4815ec74e89b852ac77c9f","title":"baftas red carpet 2020 from florence pugh to zoe kravitz in pictures","story":"There were New Balance trainers, reworn tuxes and Versace party frocks on the steps of London’s Royal Albert Hall• Baftas red carpet, the ceremony and the winners – as it happened"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39f43a5438340db0e3af40a1cec495878cac2d8/0_300_3052_1832/master/3052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97235b5a941d0e5034d960fc6c72fe3f","title":"baftas 2020 film winners full list","story":"All the prizes – including the new one for best casting – at the 73rd British Academy film awards•Baftas 2020: the red carpet, the frocks, the ceremony and winners – liveWINNER: 1917The IrishmanJokerOnce Upon a Time in HollywoodParasiteLeonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon a Time in HollywoodAdam Driver, Marriage StoryTaron Egerton, RocketmanWINNER: Joaquin Phoenix, JokerJonathan Pryce, The Two PopesWINNER: 1917 – Sam MendesThe Irishman – Martin ScorseseJoker - Todd PhillipsOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood – Quentin TarantinoParasite – Bong Joon-hoWINNER: JokerMarriage StoryOnce Upon a Time in HollywoodThe Personal History of David CopperfieldThe Two PopesThe FarewellFor SamaPain and GloryWINNER: ParasitePortrait of a Lady on FireWINNER: 1917Avengers: EndgameThe IrishmanThe Lion KingStar Wars: the Rise of SkywalkerTom Hanks, A Beautiful Day in the NeighbourhoodAnthony Hopkins, The Two PopesAl Pacino, The IrishmanJoe Pesci, The IrishmanWINNER: Brad Pitt, Once Upon a Time in HollywoodBooksmart - Susanna Fogel, Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Katie SilbermanKnives Out – Rian JohnsonMarriage Story – Noah BaumbachOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood – Quentin TarantinoWINNER: Parasite – Han Jin Won, Bong Joon-hoWINNER: Laura Dern, Marriage StoryScarlett Johansson, Jojo RabbitFlorence Pugh, Little WomenMargot Robbie, BombshellMargot Robbie, Once Upon a Time in HollywoodThe IrishmanJojo RabbitJokerWINNER: Le Mans ’66Once Upon a Time in HollywoodThe IrishmanJojo RabbitJudyWINNER: Little WomenOnce Upon a Time in HollywoodWINNER: 1917The IrishmanJojo RabbitJokerOnce Upon a Time in HollywoodWINNER: 1917JokerLe Mans ’66RocketmanStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker1917Jojo RabbitWINNER: JokerLittle WomenStar Wars: The Rise of SkywalkerAzaarGoldfishKamaliWINNER: Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You’re a Girl)The TrapFrozen IIWINNER: KlausA Shaun the Sheep Movie: FarmageddonToy Story 4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acdb784957dc46c504495e703dfbe30c30a98921/43_0_6086_3654/master/6086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17536d5b55cc6e93b0a92c34ba92158b","title":"the monarchy al pacino cats key snubs of this years baftas","story":"The red carpet has been rolled and the awards dolled out – so who has most cause to go home weeping?

Jojo Rabbit bounced off with the Bafta, following last night’s win at the Writers Guild of America awards, making it a virtual Oscars lock.When your star says she’s just attended the film’s funeral and the host chooses it as his one film to dump on, you can safely consider yourself this year’s dope in the stocks.When you’re the butt of a Rebel Wilson joke (“The Royal Andrew, no, Harry, no Albert, Hall”) after already having been rinsed by Brad Pitt – who said he was calling his award “Harry” because he “can’t wait to bring him back to the States” – you know you’re having a bad night. Particularly when the second in line to the throne is sitting in the front row. Hats were ditched not doffed.The British Academy of Film and Television Arts – or at least its membership – failed to cover themselves with glory with this set of awards. #BaftasSoWhite has been trending, Cynthia Erivo’s refusal to attend was widely reported, People Just Do Nothing’s Asim Chaudhry had a pop at Laurence Fox on stage, and Rebel Wilson drew scabrous attention to the gonads of the best director nominees. But the most ominous sign of the times must be that Bafta’s own president, Prince William, felt moved to give it a royal telling off in his normally anodyne closing remarks. “That simply cannot be right in this day and age,” said the heir to the throne. Bafta will have to get this sorted out sharpish.Netflix has already proved itself a master of the awards circuit (read: throw money at it until everyone else gives up), but even it must have been a bit surprised at its first success of the night at the Baftas. Middlingly reviewed Christmas cartoon Klaus saw off big boys Frozen II, Toy Story 4 and A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon – or, as the industry would term it: Disney, Disney and Aardman. That’s a major Hollywood studio and a national-treasure British powerhouse. Netflix isn’t messing about.Bafta has been roundly applauded – not the least by the casting director fraternity – for its inaugural award for best casting. So who did it go to? The dazzling colour-blind tapestry of Dickensian humanity that was The Personal History of David Copperfield? The immaculate late-60s pop-culture document Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? Or maybe Marriage Story, with its frankly brilliant raft of cameos underscoring two powerhouse leads? Er, no. The winner was Joker. Now, Joker is undoubtedly a superb evocation of a grimy early 80s New York (yes, we know about the King of Comedy references), and revolves around a major-league performance by Joaquin Phoenix. But no one else in the film gets much of a look-in, however good they are. Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, even Robert De Niro don’t exactly have opportunities to stretch themselves. We’re not saying just anyone could have done those roles, but apart from Phoenix it’s not exactly an acting showstopper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b069b246881db8ef0819933827d20fd759416952/814_99_3644_2186/master/3644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c89af58d2860dbc00f56bd4e85aa9004","title":"baftas 2020 the red carpet the frocks the ceremony and winners live","story":"It’s the biggest night of the year in British cinema. Join us to find out who wore what, whether incoming host Graham Norton managed to make us forget the horror of Joanna Lumley – and who won this year’s prizesAnd finally, here’s our story on that significant Joaquin Phoenix speech, definitely one of the talking points of the night. That’s it – we’re going to bed. See you for the Oscars this time next week, and thanks for watching the Baftas with us.We’ve just launched our gallery of the best images of the night.Here are the people who lost out tonight: Al Pacino, the royals and Cats for three. Florence Pugh looks as if she’s finally letting her hair down. Our Stuart Heritage is somewhere at the afterparties as we speak. Quentin Tarantino’s somewhat gloomy countenance at the Baftas is being talked about on Twitter – particularly when Bong June-ho won the screenplay award for Parasite and beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.And, naturally, we’re going to be doing this all again, only on a bigger scale, for the Oscars next Sunday. If you’re a  liveblog addict, then we’ve got a pair of them starting for the Super Bowl. Follow the actual game here and we’re blogging the attendant hoopla, ads and half-time show from J Lo here. Here’s that speech on ersity by Joaquin Phoenix, plus some commentary by writer Rebecca Carroll.The success of For Sama tonight was definitely something to celebrate. As this tweet from Channel 4’s Krishnan Guru-Murthy puts it: As for the hosting, some people are missing Stephen Fry: I never thought I\u0027d agree with a post saying \u0027Bring back Stephen Fry but.... you\u0027re right!I think part of the problem is that a couple of years ago Fry seemed to be on every time you switched on the TV so people got sick of the sight of him. But now that he\u0027s kept a relatively low profile for a few years, it might be good to see him here again. Deffo better than Norton or Lumley.So that’s it – a Baftas that talked the talk about ersity but perhaps didn’t really walk the walk, a factor called out by Joaquin Phoenix in a powerful speech. Plus, it’s pretty surprising that The Irishman – the ’s film of the year, no less – didn’t win a single gong. But that’s awards for you – often arbitrary and rather difficult to fathom.1917 won a bunch more awards – it won seven in all, putting it at the front of the queue for the Oscars when they’re dished out next Sunday.They’re now recapping the awards that weren’t broadcasted, including original score, which was won by Hildur Guðnadóttir, whom we interviewed a few weeks ago. You can see the full list here.Kathleen Kennedy remembers filming Raiders of the Lost Ark in London and having Steven Spielberg and George Lucas as mentors, vows that more will be done to be inclusive, and generally wraps up the evening with class. That’s it!This is quite a montage, taking in Star Wars, Back to the Future, Lincoln, Schindler’s List, ET and a whole lot more – all produced by Kathleen Kennedy. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are on stage to give the award to Star Wars producer Kathleen Kennedy. The camera keeps panning to a stone-faced Adam Driver who will be going home empty-handed tonight. William adds that more needs to be done to address ersity in Bafta and the film industry. “Bafta take this issue seriously and have commissioned a thorough review.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ef52de92d4eeec69d6e4e8aa8412de5a00b1cb/0_15_1809_1085/master/1809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7405cfe350f1951177787f07d4c24bd5","title":"pep guardiola swipe premier league chief richard scudamore","story":"• Manchester City manager refers to 2018 quotes from Scudamore• Guardiola concedes title, saying Liverpool are ‘unstoppable’Pep Guardiola appeared to mock Richard Scudamore after Manchester City’s 2-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, sarcastically questioning whether the Premier League is concerned that Liverpool are 22 points clear at the top of the league.Guardiola all but conceded the title to Liverpool after the champions suffered another setback at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and he let out his frustration by appearing to refer back to Scudamore, who was the league’s chief executive at the time, saying he would like “someone to get a little bit closer to City” during an interview in August 2018. City had won the title by 18 points the season before.“Two seasons ago there was the owner of the Premier League who said that could not happen again, it’s not good for the Premier League for City to win the title in that way, with 100 points,” City’s manager said. “Now it’s Liverpool, you have to be concerned if you are the owner of the Premier League.”City paid for their profligacy against Spurs. Hugo Lloris saved a penalty from Ilkay Gündogan in the first half and the game changed when Oleksandr Zinchenko was sent off for two yellow cards early in the second half. Spurs took control, goals from Steven Bergwijn and Son Heung-min lifting José Mourinho’s side four points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, and Guardiola nodded when he was asked if there is no chance of City catching Liverpool now.“They are unstoppable,” Guardiola said. “They have a lot of points, we dropped points in the games that we played quite similar to today. Even when we played Anfield. Now it’s to try to qualify for the Champions League next season.”Guardiola was unable to deliver an update on Sterling, who appeared to suffer a hamstring injury near the end, while Mourinho said he was worried about Dele Alli’s ankle injury. Alli struggled after being caught by Sterling, who was fortunate not to have a yellow card upgraded to a red after a VAR review.Mourinho also questioned why VAR took so long to award City’s penalty after Serge Aurier fouled Sergio Agüero but he was delighted with Bergwijn scoring on his debut after his £25m move from PSV Eindhoven.“It was a good goal and a very good performance,” the Spurs manager said. “It was a very solid performance, very mature. He arrived on Tuesday so he had the week to work and to try as fast as possible to understand what we wanted from him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8adbafa13df3beb1dd61f6ff187e3532556d439/0_0_6246_3748/master/6246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b7be414563553090e2390b09460f795","title":"so i got an amazon echo but can alexa get my life together","story":"Looking to streamline his life, writer Phil Samba bought an Amazon Echo Dot to see if the smart speaker could provide some assistance … Like every millennial, I’m obsessed with self improvement. Also like every millennial, I somehow constantly manage to never do any of the things I need to do to self-improve. I’m hoping that technology can help me get it together – so I got an Amazon Echo 3rd generation, with Alexa.The Echo Dot comes in a small box, which I open up to reveal a small speaker, just larger in diameter than a drinks coaster, but small enough to hold in your hand. Aesthetically, it’s very futuristic – at the top within the light ring are four tiny microphones and four buttons – volume up, volume down, mute and Alexa. It feels smooth around the sides with adaptor and aux ports at the back.Mine is heather grey, but you can get them in charcoal, plum and sandstone too – you can even get one with a clock to show you the time. There’s an information document, a charger, a user manual and a list of commands to try, such as: “Alexa, set a 10-minute timer” and “Alexa, add toilet paper to my shopping list”.To set up, I need to be connected to my wifi and download the Amazon Alexa app on to my smartphone. Set-up is easy, all within the app, and takes about five to 10 minutes – but if you struggle, there are a million and one tutorials on YouTube for you to follow and a dedicated Echo help page.There are a ton of things you can do with the Echo straight out of the box, such as setting alarms and asking it trivia questions. To unlock even more value, you can add skills via the Alexa smartphone app or just by using your voice.I like to tell people I’d be fitter if I had more time to go to the gym, safe in the knowledge that I don’t actually have the time. Now I have no excuse. I never thought Alexa would be able to help me exercise in any way, but I was wrong. The Body Coach skill allows me to work out as Joe Wicks, the Body Coach, keeps me motivated with cries of: “You’ll smash it!” It has seven 15-minute, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts to help you burn fat when you’re short on time, including marching, star jumps, squats, push-ups and crunches – and that’s just lesson one. I can’t say I’m at my target weight yet, but it’s definitely helping me get more regular exercise in.Learning a new language can be quite daunting but with the Translated skill it no longer has to be. I ask Alexa to teach me how to say any word or phrase in Spanish, and Translated reads it out so I can learn how to say it myself. I can even ask the skill to slow down or repeat the translation until I’m happy I’ve nailed it. I’ve already learned how to introduce myself: Me llamo Phil! I’m hoping that a few minutes a day practising while cooking or cleaning can really make me el experto.I often struggle to get to sleep but Sleep and Relaxation Sounds is excellent at resolving this. It has hundreds of ambient sounds that can be used to help with meditation or lull you into a state of complete relaxation. Once the skill is open, I just say: “Alexa, help me sleep”, or “Alexa, play heavy rain”, and I’m zoning out in no time listening to the downpour.My flatmate has an Echo, so we use Drop In – an inbuilt, two-way, intercom-like feature that connects two Alexa-enabled devices together once permissions are enabled. It’s perfect for letting my housemate on the top floor know that dinner is ready. All I had to do was say: “Alexa, drop in on the attic room”, and I can immediately communicate with my flatmate without walking up the steps.It turns out playing a game with a speaker is actually a lot of fun. I try out Twenty Questions: you think of any animal, mineral, music or vegetable and the skill asks 20 questions that you can answer, aiming to work it out in 20 questions or fewer. I play with Beyoncé’s 2016 single Formation – of course – and Alexa gets it in 10 questions. Impressive! You can also play a variety of other games, such as Deal or No Deal and Pointless.Alexa is a lot of fun, but, importantly, she’s really handy at helping you with those small tasks that can take up time or easily be forgotten. It can play music, tell the time, give you news briefings and weather forecasts, check traffic and so much more. Most surprisingly, it helped me to begin a brand new fitness journey. I’m interested in adding some smart tech soon to make it more powerful. I could turn lights on and off, control TVs, open garage doors and change the temperature. I’m excited to continue exploring all its capabilities.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3477d903aa9a5cb96e77cd3b32efbda873c361bd/0_31_5168_3102/master/5168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46efa4ebaa3a3ab8bc8453f87645fb57","title":"five ways to stay healthy when breastfeeding","story":"Getting enough rest, eating well and being aware of your mental health are all important when feeding your babyA good diet is particularly important when breastfeeding. “You’re fuelling yourself to fuel a baby,” says Jane Moffett, a breastfeeding counsellor with the National Childbirth Trust (NCT). “Eat a varied, balanced diet,” she says . “If you’re vegan, think about calcium-fortified foods.” Wholegrains, protein and vegetables help to regulate blood sugar and may reduce your cravings for high-fat and high-sugar foods. But, with breastfeeding burning about 300 calories a day, this is not the time to cut calories. “As you’ll be feeding through the night as well as the day, it may be an idea to take a tuck box to bed,” says Moffett.The pressure to relax can feel, ironically, rather stressful when your schedule is being dictated by a small baby. So, instead of telling yourself to sleep whenever the baby does, simply try to do things that make you happy. “Get rest,” advises Tamsin English, a baby feeding supporter based in east London. “It doesn’t have to be sleep – it could just be lying on the sofa, watching TV, or listening to music. Anything that helps you feel less frazzled.”While breastfeeding, take the time to look at your breasts in the mirror, and check them regularly for signs of tenderness. “If you start to feel fluey, have a red area on one of your breasts, or if your breasts feel painful, tell your doctor, midwife or health visitor,” says Moffett. These can be the early signs of mastitis, a painful condition caused by a buildup of milk in the breast. If you suspect mastitis may be coming on, the NHS recommends massaging the affected area in a warm shower, continuing to breastfeed, trying different positions to stimulate the blocked area and maybe starting your baby feeding on the affected breast to try to drain any blockages.Breastfeeding can cause aches and pains, particularly if you don’t watch your posture. There are different breastfeeding positions that may suit parent and baby – from the rugby hold to the cradle hold, from lying flat to lying on your side, or even the jazzy sounding “koala” position. The Medela website has useful pictures and notes of several of these positions, or you can ask to be shown them at breastfeeding drop-ins, which are usually run by local health services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd4a4f1edbbfbaa592238c9f72952ee9f133cd00/0_59_5035_3021/master/5035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b615ab9997f48c521d8522ae3a81df4","title":"how to sit properly at work","story":"Even the best chairs are not designed for sitting at for great lengths of time. The key to maintaining good posture is regular movementFirst and foremost, don’t sit for too long. You can get very expensive chairs, but if you sit on them for lengthy periods of time, you are still going to get aches and pains. Take regular breaks – at least five minutes every hour – and have standing or walking meetings. Walk to talk to somebody instead of sending them an email.If you are working from home, a hard kitchen chair is probably not as good as an office chair, so take more breaks. Relaxing in an armchair or on the sofa will have less of a toll on the body but you will still need toget up frequently. Movement is the key to good muscular-skeletal health.Understand how your office chair works. To achieve a good posture, it is about being relaxed and having as much surface area of your body in contact with the chair as possible, such as the lumbar support going right into the curve of your back. Start with your feet firmly on the floor or a footrest, and adjust the height. If it is too easy to slip your fingers under your thighs, your seat is too low if it is too hard, your seat is too high. Armrests are not meant for you to rest your arms on, they are to help you get in and out of the chair, so don’t worry about them unless you have a shoulder problem. It is inevitable that you will slouch – our muscles get fatigued quite quickly – but if your chair is set up properly, you won’t slouch very far. If you are slouching, go for a walk.Matt Birtles, principal ergonomist at the Health and Safety Executive, was talking to Emine Saner"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf2d97fd1a9aab849293c459ebd5e759bbc5d83/439_0_3168_1901/master/3168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1a79580332b8d3faa3e75a2e5cc1615","title":"how to write perfect to do list","story":"Looking for freedom from that familiar nagging feeling? Here’s how to get stuff done without overwhelming yourselfIt is simple and elegant and ordered. In theory, the to-do list is the answer to all your productivity problems. First, write “write to-do list” at the top, just so you have something to tick off immediately, then list all the things you need to get done. Work your way through, then bask in the glory of your achievement.Except, for many of us, our lists are never-ending. “That’s why I don’t like to-do lists – because they become so overwhelming that they’re intimidating and then you never want to look at them,” says Julie Morgenstern, an organising and productivity expert and the author of Time Management from the Inside Out. “They’re a place to capture tasks, but not execute tasks.”Clare Evans, a time-management and productivity coach, agrees. She doesn’t like calling them “to-do lists”. “I refer to them as action lists,” she says. To create an effective action list, fill it with things on which you will truly take action don’t create a giant inventory of random, and perhaps unimportant, tasks.List a maximum of 10 tasks for the day. “Realistically, how much can you fit in? It might be five or six things, or only one. Identify the most important thing you need to do today and how long each task is going to take.” Know that you will almost certainly underestimate this. “Allocate time in the day when you’re going to do it,” says Evans. Evans recommends tackling the task you are least looking forward to first. Roy Baumeister, a professor of psychology at the University of Queensland and the co-author of Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength, advises including “some easy things as well as the harder ones. You can start right away on a couple of easy ones, get those out of the way, and have a good feeling of making progress. But given that willpower is limited, you should not squander it all on the easy ones – treat those as warm-ups.” Tasks should be specific and small, he says. “Rather than ‘clean out and paint garage’, maybe start with ‘buy paint’ and ‘fill one trash barrel’, and so on.”Ideally, says Morgenstern, you wouldn’t keep a to-do list at all – “your to-dos should be integrated into your calendar immediately. It enables you to account for and plan your days realistically. For every to-do, how long is it going to take and when are you going to do it? Wednesday morning? Saturday afternoon? Then you have no list, but a plan.”That said, it is helpful to keep a master list somewhere, to capture every looming task, she says. Morganstern recommends sub-iding it to avoid chaos or feeling overwhelmed. “It could be work versus home life. Within your work, it could be administrative, writing, marketing and team tasks.”This should help with working through them – once you have scheduled them. “We should execute by category – batch processing. Do all your financial stuff at one time, all your marketing stuff, all your people stuff. That’s a more efficient way to operate than switching back and forth.”Once you have completed some tasks that you had been putting off, should you give yourself a reward? These can be useful “if there are things you don’t like to do and need to motivate yourself to do,” says Morgenstern. But for most tasks the satisfaction of getting something done – and the freedom from that nagging feeling – is more than enough. “I think getting to-dos done is the reward for most people. People crave accomplishment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60684842570c8a120aa6cddbad7909b0901a9511/0_37_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=551bea1e5d941c2818161bdedcdfe140","title":"are you a woman who has experienced insolvency in later life","story":"If you have been insolvent over the age of 65, we would like to hear from youAccording to the government’s Insolvency Service, the number of personal insolvencies in England and Wales climbed to a nine-year high last year.We’d like to hear from women who have had to face insolvency.

She stuck around to say hello afterwards, as did the actor Brie Larson, who proved herself to be, in Olsen’s assessment, “super down-to-earth and really normal and just chill”.Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, called up ahead of one LA gig and was duly granted a parking space, her own green room and a prime viewing position at the side of the stage. “It was really sweet,” Olsen recalls. “She took selfies with everybody, with my record in her mouth. I was like: ‘This is so stupid!’ It was a fun time.”You’d think the Missouri-born singer-songwriter, who had built up a passionate following but was still at a remove from the mainstream, would have been gratified by all this starry attention. But Olsen, who has a bone-dry sense of humour, which she expresses in perfect deadpan, recalls the surge of interest that followed My Woman with a raised eyebrow. “There were a lot of people coming out of the woodwork going: ‘I loved the My Woman record.’ I’m like: ‘Yeah…’” She affects to look supremely unmoved. “‘I’ve made records before.’”By then, Olsen had been putting out music for the best part of a decade. She released her first solo EP in 2010 and followed it with an album of raw, acoustic folk songs entitled Half Way Home. On 2014’s Burn Your Fire for No Witness, she shifted up a gear, embracing the buzz of electric guitars and giving full vent to her extraordinary, multifaceted voice. The NME gave the record 910 and called it “sublime”, while Pitchfork, rounding up the best albums of the past decade in December, ranked it at No 26.But it was My Woman, her third full-length, that brought Olsen to a wider audience, breaking the Billboard top 50 and landing her high-profile festival slots at Glastonbury and Primavera. In an era when pop careers go stratospheric on the strength of a single track, such a gradual rise seems positively old-fashioned – but that’s only fitting for an artist who takes much of her musical inspiration, along with a penchant for beehive hairstyles and sequinned dresses, from the middle decades of the 20th century.Last October, Olsen released All Mirrors, her biggest, boldest album to date. A brooding, synth-laden opus that harnesses the full firepower of a 12-piece string section, it has been universally acclaimed – for Olsen’s risk-taking as much as the shimmering beauty of her arrangements. “It’s an album that keeps taking ostensibly recognisable musical forms and twisting them out of shape into something challenging and intriguing,” wrote the ’s Alexis Petridis.We meet in Lisbon, where Olsen has just kicked off a three-week European tour to promote the album, culminating with three English dates and a Valentine’s Day finale in Glasgow. Last night at Capitólio, a cuboid art deco building in the city’s theatre district, Olsen and her six-piece band made a heroic effort to reproduce the orchestral swoon of All Mirrors in a live setting. The thousand or so audience members may not have noticed a few rough edges in the performance, but Olsen felt the need to account for it. “I’m feeling a little loose tonight,” she confessed at one point in the set. “We haven’t played together for a month.”The next morning, when we meet at a kiosk on Praça das Flores, last night’s niggles are still playing on her mind. I try to reassure her by saying that slightly imperfect live shows are often more interesting than fully polished ones, but I’m not certain this has the desired effect.It probably doesn’t help that she’s a little bleary-eyed from post-show birthday celebrations – Olsen turned 33 yesterday and her band marked it by lighting candles in a plateful of Portuguese custard tarts. “We had a nightcap afterwards and then I realised it was three o’clock,” she winces as I order her an emergency cappuccino.We retreat to a quieter part of the square, away from the traffic, and settle on a weather-beaten bench where Olsen chats freely about the pitfalls of touring and the occasional excesses of her fans, a number of whom have had her face tattooed on their bodies (“That’s really weird to me,” she says). In person, she is warm, funny – and impressively composed, considering the lack of sleep. She tells me she felt nervous last night, but on stage Olsen struck me as imperturbable, even when the entire room interrupted her to sing happy birthday.Unlike many musicians, she doesn’t seem to mind discussing the (often very intimate) experiences that feed into her songwriting. Later, as we talk about the painful genesis of All Mirrors, I ask if she ever finds herself thinking, in the middle of a full-blown romantic crisis, that she might get some good material from it.“Oh yeah,” she says matter-of-factly. “And I think that anyone who dares to date an artist or a writer shouldn’t be surprised if they end up in their art in some form.”Does she ever get people saying: “That was about me, wasn’t it?”“I’ve had people ask, and then I say: ‘Huh.’” Long pause. “‘It’s interesting that you think that.’” She deploys her finest withering stare. “‘Hmm… I do care about you but… No. It has nothing to do with you.’”All Mirrors contains plenty of material to get ex-partners in a lather, but right now Olsen’s concerns are focused on the tour ahead. It can be tough going, she says. You don’t know when your next laundry opportunity will be. You end up drinking terrible coffee at motorway service stations. After eight solid weeks on the road in late 2016, she says: “I was not fun to be around. I was drinking a lot. And I just felt so responsible for everyone’s happiness.”Learning hard lessons, and taking charge of her life to minimise future bitterness, is one of the central themes of the latest album. After My Woman came out, as Miley Cyrus et al were queuing up to show their love, Olsen went through a painful breakup with a boyfriend she would rather not name. Around the same time, she started reassessing old friendships that were causing her more grief than happiness.“I spent a lot of time feeling really bitter and disappointed about the way people in my life saw me or interpreted me,” she says. “For me, All Mirrors is about letting go of toxic relationships, and also forgiving yourself for making mistakes, and not expecting that everyone is measuring you the way you’re measuring yourself. And if some people are, do you really need them around?”This subject is blown up to near-operatic proportions on All Mirrors’s opening track, Lark, in which Olsen lets rip at a partner who professes his devotion even as he moves to smother her creative ambitions. “You say you love Every single part,” she sings over a cascade of wailing strings. “What about my dreams? What about the heart?”Olsen’s dream of making music, and the single-minded focus she applied to it, arrived early. Adopted aged three by a couple who had fostered her soon after her birth, she grew up in St Louis, a midwestern city she remembers as “kind of depressing”. Her family were poor, relying on her father’s income from the car manufacturer Chrysler, but she had access to guitar and piano lessons – “and I did end up going to rock shows at a really young age,” she says, “so that was fun”.Her adoptive parents, who already had seven children, were much older – they are now in their 70s and 80s – and Olsen recalls searching for ways to bridge the generation gap. “I started listening to music from the time they grew up in,” she says (the influence of artists such as Patsy Cline and Roy Orbison is often discerned in her work). “I was trying to understand my parents a little bit and think about what they would have been like at my age.”She also began making music of her own. “I had a little Panasonic handheld tape recorder that I would take everywhere,” she says. “And I was pretty private about it. My mom would say: ‘I heard you working on a song, that sounds nice.’ And I’d be like” – she adopts a stern expression – “‘Please don’t listen. I’m working on it. It’s not done yet.’”Moving to Chicago aged 20, she enrolled in and dropped out of a massage therapy course, released an EP on cassette, and fell in with folk eccentric Will Oldham, who recruited her to perform in his covers band the Babblers and sing backing vocals for his Bonnie “Prince” Billy alias.By the time she released her debut album, Olsen’s voice seemed fully formed: she sang about death and betrayal with an intimacy that made her listeners feel like she was confiding in them directly. But with each subsequent record her sound took an unexpected leap. Whereas Burn Your Fire fizzed with a lo-fi rock energy, its successor was more polished, more immediate, veering towards full-on pop on Shut Up Kiss Me, still Olsen’s most popular track (and the one she most resents having to play live).“For My Woman, I was like, I want to make a classic rock’n’roll record,” she says. “I wanted to have all these crazy harmonies and make it sound like something from the 60s or 70s.” With All Mirrors, by contrast, she had no such plans. “The pieces were coming in one day at a time. It was really scary. I also knew that this material wasn’t as happy or upbeat and it wasn’t going to be immediate with some of my fans who loved the previous record.”“All Mirrors felt like an end of a chapter in a way,” says Olsen. The album moves from the fury and anguish of Lark to the realisation, on Tonight, that being in a relationship isn’t a necessary precondition for happiness. “I like the life that I lead,” she sings breathily in the opening verse, before delivering the crushing payoff: “Without you.”A big moment on this path, for Olsen, was buying herself a house in Asheville, the easygoing North Carolina city she moved to in 2013. Having a place of her own to retreat to after weeks on the road underlined for Olsen the pleasures of solitude.“I joke around about it, but I just don’t really want anyone in my house,” she says. “I don’t want anyone to wake up next to me. In my mind I’d be thinking: ‘I can’t wait till you leave so I can shower and play the music I want.’”She’s in no rush to get into another romantic tangle – and anyway, she laughs: “The dating scene in Asheville is pretty bleak. It’s like: ‘Did we date already? Or was it my friend that dated you?’“I don’t know,” she goes on, “maybe there will be some more drama in my life later. But I don’t really feel the need to get crazy drunk any more. I don’t want to go out all the time. I feel boring. My life is calm. And that’s good. But I almost miss the drama like a little bit. You know? Paul, who is playing guitar with me, was like: ‘Don’t worry, something dramatic will happen to you.’”We get on to talking about politics, where there is an excess of drama at the moment.“It’s like a TV show,” she says. “It’s like the world is a TV show, with alt-right leaders. And they’re all like trying to be like each other. It’s really strange. But at the same time, I’ve personally seen a lot of younger people become more political. That makes me happy. It makes me look forward to the next election in the US. I have some hope.”Does she see a Democratic candidate who could deliver on that hope?“Yes, I think so.” She seems reluctant to specify, so I prompt her. “I mean, I’m for Bernie,” she says. “But of course, we have to keep him alive for a while.”“It’s hard. And it’s a weird time to be self-promotional about your record and to go on tour and pretend that these things aren’t affecting you on a daily basis.”But doesn’t music have the ability to help in some way?“I think it does.” She nods. “I think music has always been used as a way of healing, of encouraging people to take a moment and be reflective.”One piece of music that affected her recently is by the American soul singer Alice Smith. “My friend showed me her live performance on YouTube, a cover of I Put a Spell on You. It’s insane. It’s been a long time since I saw or heard something like that. It’s really, really special. When I hear performances like that, I’m like: ‘OK, I need to go home and work on my shit.’”Which brings us to the question of goals. Now that she’s reached the end of a chapter with All Mirrors, and bought herself a house, and a cat, and resolved a bunch of issues and achieved some calm in her life, what’s driving her? What are her musical ambitions going forward?“I’m just happy it’s lasted this long,” she says.“I hope to keep growing as an artist, and it’s really cool to see that people want to come and listen to my music. But I don’t really want to be a pop star. I don’t want to merge into that world. It’s fun to collaborate with pop stars sometimes” – she recorded a track, True Blue, with Mark Ronson last summer – “and have a good time, and joke with people about it…”But in terms of exposure, has she reached a level she’s satisfied with? Is she happy to continue attracting celebrities to her shows without actually becoming one herself?She doesn’t give it a second’s thought.“Yeah,” she says flatly. “I don’t know if my label or manager would agree, but yeah. I would be OK with that.”Angel Olsen plays Bristol, London, Manchester and Glasgow, 10-14 Feb.

Sometimes I feel I am Scots. I’m very Scottish now, especially after Brexit,” he told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show.“Emotionally, I have no doubt everyone would be enthusiastic here, in Brussels and more widely in Europe, but still we have treaties and formalities. But if you ask me about our emotions, there’s a genuine feeling. You will witness only, I think, empathy.”The public sector union Unison added to that sense of momentum when its Scottish council voted on Saturday to back calls for a second referendum. Even so, the YouGov poll found most Scots oppose a fresh vote for the next two years, even if the Scottish National party wins a majority of seats in next year’s Holyrood election.Tusk said there were significant legal issues facing Scotland were it to become independent and seek readmission to the EU, as well as the diplomatic convention of not interfering in a state’s internal affairs.The EU has been clear Scotland would need to apply afresh, alongside other applicants.Sturgeon’s government plans to legislate where it can to make Scotland’s domestic policies stick as closely as possible to EUs regulations, to help its case for fast-tracked readmission.That opens up a further area of conflict between Sturgeon and Boris Johnson’s government.The prime minister is expected to reject Brussel’s demands for close alignment on key areas of policy such as workers’ rights, state aid and the environment in the UK-EU trade talks, including UK-wide policies controlled by Westminster.Scotland would not be able to win back any of the concessions the UK had within the EU, such as less onerous VAT rules or exemption from the Schengen security treaty. Scotland would also be expected to rejoin the common fisheries policy – a system which boosted the pro-Brexit vote in Scottish fishing areas.Alyn Smith, the SNP MP and former MEP who championed Scotland’s case in Brussels, said Tusk’s remarks proved “Scotland would be welcomed back into the EU with open arms as an independent country. What senior Europeans are saying in public is what they have been saying in private for some time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections.

Söll, perhaps the best-known of the resorts to Brits, is renowned for its night skiing, as Austria’s biggest night ski area, with five groomed pistes lit up with lights until 9.30pm, a floodlit snowpark and tobogganing day and night on special runs, plus a valley descent you can ski until 10.30pm. Ellmau, too, has night tobogganing.Every fun day on the mountain has to end with apres ski, and you’d need longer than a week to sip a spiced glühwein (mulled wine) or flügel (a popular Austrian ski drink of Red Bull, vodka and cranberry) in each village’s cosy mountain inns and slopeside hideaways. Among them are Soll’s Moonlight bar, with several levels, and Fabels in Ellmau, both with live DJs. From 7-29 March, there’s even more live music than usual for the Apres Ski Weeks festival, with folk music, jazz and rock in the mountain huts, and free ski guides on hand to lead revellers between them.The most romantic thing to do after dark has to be visiting the Alpeniglu village at Hochbrixen, where 18 igloos offer overnight stays, parties in an ice bar and an ice art and sculpture exhibition. The sudden cold that arrives at night can shock like a punch, but here guests are soon cosied up, wrapped in furs and sipping hot wine. Sundowners in the domed bar carved from ice are followed by a fondue at private ice dining tables, a snowshoe treasure hunt in the forest, or a nightcap by the campfire. Then you can snuggle into Arctic-grade sleeping bags on piles of reindeer furs where you remain toasty warm until the morning.Skiers of all levels are in for a treat here – it’s one of the biggest and most modern ski resorts in the world, with 90 cable cars and lifts accessing 176 miles of slopes across the linked ski areas of Brixen im Thale, Ellmau, Going, Hopfgarten, Itter, Kelchsau, Scheffau, Söll and Westendorf. Each resort has its own character and cool features: Westendorf has fun parks and a snowboarding scene Ellmau is known for its huge ersity of runs, remarkable viewpoints and fun parks Scheffau is great for learner pistes and easy cruising blues and Hopfgarten is the perfect place for astounding views, especially from the top of the Hohe Salve peak, home to a little pilgrimage church and where 70 peaks over 3,000m can be viewed from the top, including the Grossglockner, Austria’s highest mountain.If you’ve ever skied in one of those cranky old resorts, with lifts that break down all the time, poor piste maintenance, and shonky overpriced cafes … well, SkiWelt isn’t like that. This is a resort striving to be one of Austria’s best, constantly upgrading, and with a drive towards sustainability. Most of the resorts have snowparks, there are many long runs down to the valley, challenging steep pistes and backcountry for advanced skiers, including long scenic tours such as the SkiWelt tour, which has 21 valley runs, or perhaps your own ski safari across the whole area. But it’s perfect for first-timers and families too, with gentle beginners’ sections in each resort, and an easygoing vibe. Even the terrain has a friendly look, no scarily severe-looking peaks, just the beautiful iconic limestone outcrop that gives the SkiWelt region its identity, rising above everything.This season, a new eight-person chairlift, the Fleidingbahn, with heated seats and bubble cover, rolls into action in the SkiWelt Westendorf, up to the ski area’s highest point at 1,892 metres. In Hochbrixen, a new Zinsbergbahn lift will replace the old, combining eight-seater chairs and large gondolas, the first of its kind in the Kitzbühel Alps, which also generates photovoltaic electricity year-round. SkiWelt Brixen has a solar-powered system for snowmaking that only uses reservoir water from rainwater and snowmelt, there’s free charging for electric cars in several spots and the whole resort now relies on renewable energy. These efforts have won the region several awards. Those who want to minimise their own carbon footprint while visiting can reach SkiWelt by train from London St Pancras via Amsterdam, travelling overnight on the Alpen Express sleeper train to the gorgeous, characterful city of Kufstein nearby (worth visiting for a day in its own right, for its beautiful medieval old town, cobbled streets, towering fortress and Stollen, a cavernous, speakeasy gin bar that has the world’s largest gin gallery more than 1,000 varieties).Yet, aside from the investment in constant modernisation, this is a region soaked in the warmth of traditional Austrian hospitality. The historic mountain inns (of which there are 81) feel somehow polished yet cosy and rustic, and cater amazingly well for kids.The family-owned Kaiserhof Ellmau, for example, is right on the slopes, with a huge spa and wellness area, amazing views, kids’ club and an award-winning kitchen that’s won two prestigious Gault Millau torques for its creative twists on local classics.Others have play areas that would be paid-for attractions in their own right in the UK, with unique and witty touches that are pure magic for little ones.Across every aspect, this is an area that knows how to have fun.Find out more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500ac61b1c194e765f4b0b9478de5b95932cacc8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2d585ed338aae23b819ebb82ac41c70","title":"rates of insolvency among women over 65 rapidly increasing","story":"Across all age groups insolvency rate of women overtaken menKate’s husband had a stroke in December 2009. Because she was in full-time employment, she was unable to claim any help with rent or council tax. When her husband died in 2018, her debts became unsustainable.“I have always had credit cards and had never missed a repayment but I was struggling to meet my financial commitments. Going bankrupt was the only way forward,” she said. “The thought filled me with absolute despair but there was no other way out.“Emotionally I hide how I feel to others,” she added. “Truthfully, I am very sad and as a woman and of my age, I find it even harder as I feel I am hiding a terrible secret.”Stuart Lewis, founder of Rest Less, said the rapidly increasing rate of insolvency among all women is “cause for concern” but is particularly concerning among women over 55, “many of whom are already at higher risk of finding themselves in a financially precarious position”.“The over-55s are more likely to be made redundant, to be in long-term unemployment and to face age discrimination in the recruitment process when applying for jobs,” he said. “Women in their 50s and 60s are also more likely to have taken time out of the workplace and to have caring responsibilities, whether for elder relatives, partners or grandchildren.“Add to this, the wide gulf in private pension savings between men and women – due to 40 years of a historical gender pay gap – and it’s no surprise to see why insolvencies among women over 65 are rising faster than other groups,” he said.Mark Sands, chair of the Personal Insolvency Committee at R3, the insolvency trade body, said the statistics suggest women are seeking help for debt problems instead of letting the cycle continue.“These new statistics show that women account for two thirds of those applying for Debt Relief Orders, introduced a decade ago to offer a cost-effective, easily-accessible way out for those under £20,000 in debt and have few, if any assets,” he said.Sands also said women reaching retirement are likely to be more vulnerable to insolvency than any other group. “Women of that age are least likely to have a workplace pension. They’ll be relying entirely on the state pension which isn’t enough to continue to make any debt repayments they’ve been making.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e86c0a995605b560414527e77404149eba503f/0_84_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c895201ee6d270bdf4aa276a79413b84","title":"have you been affected by changes to disability welfare payments","story":"We’d like you to help us document how problems with welfare benefits have affected people with disabilities.

To come back at his age and do it on the number one stage, that’s fantastic.”Leopardstown agreed. The grandstand emptied as soon as Faugheen crossed the line half a length in front of Easy Game, a stable companion who is half his age, to acclaim their returning hero just 14 months on from a horrible fall at the same course which left him on the turf for two agonising minutes. Twelve-year-old Grade One winners are a great rarity – only Sizing Europe (2014 Punchestown Champion Chase) and Florida Pearl, in the 2004 Irish Gold Cup, have achieved the feat in recent decades. Victory in a Grade One novice event at such an advance age is more astonishing still and Faugheen’s connections must now decide whether to attempt an unprecedented double at Cheltenham next month.Delta Work, the 5-2 second-favourite, stayed on best at the end of a demanding race for the Irish Gold Cup here on Sunday, beating Kemboy and Presenting Percy to give Gordon Elliott, his trainer, a first success in Ireland’s most prestigious staying chase.The first three horses home approached the final fence with less than a length between them, but Delta Work jumped best to secure an advantage that he held to the line. It was the fifth Grade One success of his career, which includes a win in the ultra-competitive Pertemps Handicap Hurdle final at the Cheltenham Festival in 2018.Delta Work is top-priced at around 6-1 for the Gold Cup in an open market in which Al Boum Photo, Lostintranslation, Kemboy, Santini and Clan Des Obeaux are all on offer at single-figure odds.Mullins added another significant runner to his Cheltenham team when Asteroin Forlonge forged clear of the Elliott-trained favourite Easywork to win the Chanelle Pharma Novice Hurdle over two miles. His Festival target, though, is more likely to be the two-and-a-half mile Ballymore Novice Hurdle, as Joe Donnelly, his owner, also owns Shishkin, the current favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle.Aspire Tower was sent off at 1-3 to justify his status as favourite for next month’s Triumph Hurdle, only to fall at the last while trying to fend off a strong challenge from Joseph O’Brien’s Cerberus. With the race seemingly at his mercy, Cerberus then idled on the run-in as his stable companion A Wave Of The Sea ran on to snatch the win.All three seem likely to renew rivalry at the Festival, but the result strengthened the form claims of Allmankind (5-1), who beat Cerberus with ease at Chepstow last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/727876344d8db8fc1fa59368ebfdd0ac7e24b6b8/12_0_3462_2078/master/3462.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a3982cd36ba18f804eea1387e599912","title":"gregor townsend stuart hogg scotland ireland six nations","story":"Gregor Townsend leaped to the defence of his new captain, Stuart Hogg, after the full‑back lost control of the ball in the act of touching down. In so doing, he missed a simple try for Scotland at what felt a crucial juncture of a match Ireland won 19-12.Townsend, the Scotland head coach, was optimistic in the lead‑up to the Calcutta Cup match in Edinburgh on Saturday, backing Hogg to continue an otherwise promising start to his captaincy.Hogg’s howler, committed after some smart approach play worked him free into the corner, came early in the second half with Scotland trailing 13-6. It was not as expensive a mistake as it could have been, because the referee brought play back for a penalty that Adam Hastings converted. But the sense of despair at another chance missed by the Scots must have felt crippling, as their quest goes on to win in Dublin 4 (they did win in this city in 2010, but across the Liffey at Croke Park).“We don’t judge players on one mistake in the game,” Townsend said. “There’s hundreds of mistakes in any game, and we did get three points from that. We had other opportunities to score five and seven points. He’ll be fine and will bounce back. I think he’s a real driving force as captain of this side.”For all Scotland’s promise in attack, the familiarity of the failure to make it tell on the scoreboard might incline Scots to feel as if nothing has changed, despite the fresh faces in the lineup on Saturday. There were changes, too, in Ireland’s setup but their doggedness and refusal to yield, no matter the cuts inflicted on them by Scotland’s flashing blades, felt just as familiar.Johnny Sexton, assuming the captaincy from Rory Best, scored all of Ireland’s 19 points, including a nicely worked try in the 10th minute that promised more in the way of technical excellence than Ireland would go on to deliver. Sexton’s brilliance was surpassed only by that of Ireland’s back row, who stole ball time and again just as the visitors seemed certain to score.Opposite them, however, Scotland boasted fine performances from their own back row, as well as the man who stepped up for his first Six Nations start under controversial circumstances. Hastings looked the part at fly-half, landing all but one of his five kicks at goal, his one miss from a long way out on the angle. He will go into the match against England on Saturday with confidence.The last time the Calcutta Cup was contested on Scottish soil, Scotland ran rings round England courtesy of a masterclass by Finn Russell. After his controversial departure from the squad a fortnight ago for disciplinary reasons, there seems little hope of a rapprochement in time for Saturday.“It is not something I have thought about,” said Townsend. “We had two weeks’ training and cohesion was very important in our selection this week. Players who missed two or three days’ training did not get selected. It will be difficult for anybody who has missed the last two weeks to get into the squad.”Despite his absence, Russell made a point of supporting his erstwhile protege at Glasgow, sending Hastings a text before the match. “Finn is a class bloke,” said Hastings. “He’s been a good friend of mine ever since I arrived at Glasgow a few years ago. It was really nice of him to text me. It made me feel comfortable. He was wishing us all the best, so there is no bad blood at all.”Russell may yet be rehabilitated later in the tournament, but it feels too late for the Calcutta Cup. No matter, the calibre of playmaking is far from Scotland’s problem, whether it is Hastings or his mentor wearing the No 10 shirt. Scotland, as ever, can play a bit. What their long-suffering fans will want to see is more evidence they can make their prowess register on the scoreboard. If they can, the Calcutta Cup might remain in their hands for a third year. That has not happened since 1972."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a9efcf79350bc37bfee9f7d97ebbc4960e90685/568_101_2818_1691/master/2818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6542e3c5421593db2017141b9cceae2d","title":"jemma reekie 800m shoe technology","story":"• Scottish athlete smashes personal best by nearly four seconds• Some on social media sceptical about prototype Nike spikesJemma Reekie produced one of the finest performances by a British athlete in recent memory to display her Olympic credentials but in doing so reignited the debate over shoe technology.The 21-year-old Scottish athlete blasted past her training partner Laura Muir on the final lap to win an invitation women’s 800m race at Glasgow’s Emirates Arena on Saturday in 1min 57.91sec, half a second clear of Muir.Remarkably Reekie’s time shattered her 800m personal best by nearly four seconds, set the fastest time indoors by a woman since 2006 and also moved her to 11th on the world all-time indoors list.Reekie, 21, who also beat Jenny Meadows’ British indoor record of 1:58.43 set in 2010, later admitted her shock on social media. “I don’t even know what happened,” she said. “Thank you for all the lovely messages. I need to process this.”Her time was so fast that it would have won the 800m gold at the world championships in Doha, and it suggests Reekie, who took gold in the event at the European under-23 championships last year, can make an impact on the world stage.However, some on social media were sceptical about whether the prototype Nike spikes worn by Reekie and Muir have been a significant factor in their performances – and whether those shoes should be banned in light of World Athletics’ new rules on shoe technology.Those rules limit the number of plates and the amount of foam that can be used in shoes worn by elite runners and also ban the use of prototypes in races unless they are in the shops by 30 April. However, Andy Young, who coaches both Reekie and Muir, told the  that the shoes were legal and would be in the shops shortly.“There is no carbon plate in Laura’s or Jemma’s spikes. It’s just a plastic plate,” he said. “It has some of the foam that is in some of the new shoes. But it’s a normal looking spike and it is due to market. So Laura and Jemma’s spike will meet the new regulations in terms of plates and millimetres of foam.“These spikes are not the carbon plated spikes referenced online in pics of patents,” he added.A World Athletics spokesperson also confirmed that the shoes were not under suspicion: “If they have one plate (plus the plate that the spikes screw into) and the soles are not more than 30mm thick, then they meet the criteria.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c78e450b0dac332072a4db9874c9c075a9f255ca/0_33_2123_1274/master/2123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a5324a8004b4371e0581594100a02a8","title":"sofia kenin garbina muguruza australian open womens final","story":"By beating Garbiñe Muguruza the 21-year-old American upstaged her lauded compatriot Coco Gauff and showed a champion’s resolveOn one of the several tumultuous days at this Australian Open, Chris Evert, perhaps the most perceptive of the former champions with access to a TV microphone, said: “Coco has arrived. We need that shot in the arm and we need some new blood in the women’s game.”The American, who won 18 of her 34 grand slam singles finals, was talking about her 15-year-old compatriot, Coco Gauff, who had already put Venus Williams out of a slam in the first round for the second time in seven months, and had then beaten the defending champion, Naomi Osaka. Tennis was ready to crown its new princess.Sofia Kenin was not quite so ready. The 21-year-old American, seeded 14th, might have reckoned there would be more noise attending her own progress, as she worked her way into the fourth round past two qualifiers and the unseeded Shuai Zhang without dropping a set.There she looked across the net at Gauff, the player nearly everyone wanted to embrace as the next big prospect, an articulate and thoughtful teenager, respectful of her peers and the history of the game, and owner of a game that combined exquisite touch and growing power.Kenin, it was said, lacked pop on her serve, especially if her first effort did not land, and her volleying needed work. But she beat Gauff, whom she likes, in three sets, the last without conceding a game. She found a way. Now they began to talk about the daughter of impoverished immigrants, about her father and coach, Alex, who had arrived in the United States from Russia with just $300 in his pocket, three months after she was born, and occupied the front row of her players’ box all fortnight like some knowing old party apparatchik.Now Sofia – or Sonia, as he calls her – was going to pay him back, big time. In the quarters, she beat the unheralded Tunisian, Ons Jabeur, who had done some giant-killing of her own in beating Johanna Konta, the two Carolines – Garcia and Wozniacki – and the 27th seed, Wang Qiang. She fell to Kenin in straight sets. As did the world No 1 and home favourite, Ashleigh Barty. The clamour for the American with no discernibly big weapons but a huge fighting spirit began to grow.On Saturday, it appeared her run to glory, in her first slam final, might shudder to a halt when Garbiñe Muguruza, the double-slam champion, won the first set. Yet again, Kenin found a way. In just over two hours on Rod Laver Arena she ground down the experienced Spaniard 4-6, 6-2, 6-2. Evert, who has known Kenin since she was six and watched her grow up in Florida, a shy but determined young player, said: “Sofia has been undervalued and she has been overshadowed by a lot of the American power players. But now America knows her and what she has. They know she is a champion.”She is also the new American No 1 – eclipsing Serena Williams – and the world No 7. She is moving comfortably in space occupied by Gauff, Osaka, Barty, Bianca Andreescu and Simona Halep. She is a threat to all of them.Kenin, who beat Serena Williams in the third round of the 2019 French Open and has twice reached round two at Wimbledon, will look towards Europe when the dust settles.“Wimbledon is such a tradition,” she said. “You really feel it there. I love coming back, I love the people the crowd is so fun.”She appreciated that her parents struggled in Russia. “My dad has told me that it was a tough time for them. They didn’t have that much when they came to the States. They wanted to give me the American dream. I am really thankful. Without them, I wouldn’t be where I am today.“Some people didn’t really believe in me. They turned me down and said I wouldn’t make it or I was too small. We never took that seriously. I had a goal, I had a dream and we achieved it.“A lot of youngsters are coming up and winning grand slams. I think it’s great for women’s tennis. It is changing and has become more exciting for everyone.”Kenin retained her beguiling innocence, a slightly overawed kid, still, in front of the world’s media late on Saturday evening, nursing a large glass of champagne and glancing over to her proud father for guidance. He is not an overbearing “tennis dad”, more a kindly mentor, who – like Maria Sharapova’s father before them – knew hardship and found a way out of it.Kenin, who more than doubled her career earnings with a winner’s cheque for $A4.1m (£2.08m), stopped smiling long enough to reveal she would be raiding the Cartier shop in Melbourne . “I got my eye on a few things,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f2b712e9f0ae8af5132806adc352f9413a99bc4/0_70_5265_3159/master/5265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d244670313d193ad451d512e77392955","title":"australian open tennis novak djokovic umpire","story":"Novak Djokovic does not believe he crossed the line touching the chair umpire during a volatile Australian Open final on Sunday night. The Serb is facing the prospect of a hefty fine for twice tapping Damien Dumusois on the foot while remonstrating with the French official during his drama-charged five-set win over Dominic Thiem.The Serbian lost his cool when he was handed back-to-back time violations in the one game for taking too long to serve. With the score locked at 4-4 in the second set, the second penalty came at break point and cost him a first serve, with Djokovic losing the game.A furious Djokovic marched past the umpire’s chair and tapped Dumusois’s foot and sarcastically exclaimed: “You made yourself famous in this match. Great job. Especially in the second one. Great job. You made yourself famous. Well done, man”.Dumusois did not react. But, according to the official grand slam rule book, Djokovic could find himself hit with a $US20,000 ($A30,000) fine, although penalties are discretionary.The rules state: “Players shall not at any time physically abuse any official, opponent, spectator or other person within the precincts of the tournament site. Violation of this section shall subject a player to a fine up to $US20,000 for each violation.”But Djokovic does not believe he overstepped the mark. “For touching his shoe? I mean, I didn’t know that’s completely forbidden,” he said after capturing his eighth Open crown.“I thought it was a nice, really friendly touch. I wasn’t aggressive with him in terms of physical abuse. I just couldn’t believe that I got the time violation. It kind of disturbed me. That’s all there is to it.“Verbally we did have some exchanges, but no insults because if I did insult him, I would get a warning. Right now that you tell me that, I want to thank him for not giving me a warning for touching him. That’s all I can say.”Djokovic maintains the second violation was not necessary. “The first one, fine, no problem,” he said. “The second one, it’s just not necessary under the circumstances for a experienced chair umpire.“I thought probably he, in my opinion, could have reacted a little bit better in that situation. These kind of things in games switch the momentum of the match. It was a very important game.“Obviously four-all, I broke his serve back, got myself back in the second set, then lost that game. He won the second set. That completely changed the momentum of the match.”En route to his 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory, Djokovic also took issue with the Rod Laver Arena crowd getting behind underdog Thiem, who had never won a grand slam.Despite leading, Djokovic took aim at the fans during the first set when he felt his serves were interrupted by crowd. “Shut the fuck up,” he was heard saying."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c36f9aab810873f2ca7f9c73fea75fc33c3200c/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67adb3b3b1f358505d5715e78ff78225 720w","title":"super bowl 2020 san francisco 49ers kansas city chiefs live","story":"And the call is indeed overturned. It’s 3rd \u0026amp 15 instead. Mahomes is in a tight spot, so he decides to just launch one to Hill, and I mean launch! It’s a 44 yar completion and the Chiefs are at the Kanas City 35. THAT is what Mahomes has been doing these past two seasons.The Chiefs are hit with an untimely false start penalty, which pushes them back five yards. Mahomes’s first down throw… is to nowhere. 2nd \u0026amp 15… Oh now that’s what the Chiefs need right here, it’s a pass to Hill for a first down.…Or is it? The 49ers challenge the ruling on the field, thinking that Hill actually trapped the ball. Replay suggests that they might be right.Williams picks up a few yards on first down. It’s 2nd \u0026amp 6, Mahomes scrambles again and he finds a first down. He’s doing more with his legs than his arm, it seems. His next throw, is very low to Tyreek Hill and that’s almost—but not quite—a first down. 2nd \u0026amp 1, they’re going fast here, Williams picks up a few yards and a new set of downs.The Chiefs have a guy on their team who has a beard longer than Mahomes longest pass to his own guys.They’re going to need some Mahomes Magic if they want to pull off this comeback and they’re running out of time.Hardman makes a fair catch at the Kansas City 17. They’ll have a lot of ground to cover here.1st \u0026amp 10, Mostert picks up just a yard. 2nd \u0026amp 9, Garoppolo throws incomplete. It’s 3rd \u0026amp 9 and the Chiefs desperately need a stop right here, right now. And here’s a flag. False start on the 49ers, which means a five yard penalty. It’s now 3rd \u0026amp 14 , which will make this somewhat easier for the Kansas City defense. Garoppolo tries to scramble and is pushed out of bounds before getting a first down. The 49ers have to punt, and the Chiefs have a chance at a do-over here.If the 49ers end up winning, that interception will be remembered as the key play. The Chiefs looked to be in position to score and instead San Francisco has the ball back on its 20. Mostert picks up six yards on first down. Expect a lot of running from here on out.Mahomes unleashes a risky flow, he’s lucky that it only falls incomplete. On 2nd \u0026amp 10, his aim is much better, he finds Hill for a 14 yard gain. They’re in San Francisco territory now. On 1st \u0026amp 10, Mahomes finds Williams who is able to avoid defenders and pick up 13 yards. They’re at the San Francisco 27.Well, very briefly. DeForest Buckner gets a huge sack on Mahomes, pushing him back nine yards. On 2nd \u0026amp 19, Mahomes scrambles—he’s quite good at that—and picks up 13. That sack could loom large if they can’t convert here on 3rd \u0026amp 6.Oh no, Mahomes’s pass to Hill is picked off by Tarvarius Moore! Disaster for Kansas City!Why is the KC Chiefs Safety #32 Tyrann Mathieu allowed to wear yellow luminous gloves... the same colour as the officials’ penalty flags. Very confusing, especially this late at nightWell, what other color gloves would you wear if your nickname was the Honey Badger?49ers 20-10 Chiefs, end of the 3rd quarterMahomes targets Watkins and that’s nothing doing. He does find Kelce on second down, but Kelce can’t quite pick up the first down. They try it again on third down and this time Kelce converts as time runs out in the third quarter. The Chiefs will be at their own 46 to start the fourth quarter.The Chiefs will have to play comeback here, but the good news for them is that they’re the masters at doing so. Just ask the Houston Texans. On 1st \u0026amp 10, Mahomes has to throw his pass away thanks to the 49ers’ defense. 2nd and 10, they opt to go back to the run, with Williams picking up five. 3rd \u0026amp 5, the Chiefs are in danger of a three-and-out. Mahomes, again under pressure, scrambles and…. Just makes a first down.Things can change quickly in the NFLMostert picks up two yards and Garoppolo’s next throw to Sanders lands somewhere in no man’s land. Sanders gets grabbed on the play, but there’s no holding call on this play. Instead, it’s 3rd \u0026amp 8. Garoppolo finds Kendrick Bourne for a 26 yard gain and they’re at the San Francisco 11.Garoppolo goes to Juszczyk who almost makes it into the end zone for the second time tonight. Instead, it’s first and goal and the 49ers give it to Mostert who punches it in. The extra point is good and the interception proves incredibly costly for the Chiefs.So far, this game is playing towards San Francisco’s strengths. They have the ball here at their own 45. Garoppolo with a big throw here on first down, a 16-yard completion to Samuel. They’re on the Kansas City 39.Mahomes-to-Kelce gives them four yards, but on 2nd \u0026amp 6, Williams can’t advance. There’s a chance here for San Francisco for a stop, but Mahomes finds Watkins again for a nine-yard gain. The Chiefs stay alive.1st \u0026amp 10 on the Kansas City 41, Williams picks up five yards. Oof, Nick Bosa with a great play to knock the ball out of Mahomes’s hands. The quarterback recovers the ball and keeps possession, but that’s a six-yard loss. On the next play, Mahomes lets it fly downfield …... right into the hands of San Francisco’s Fred Warner! A huge interception!First Chiefs possession of the half. Hardman goes off for a 15 yard gain but it’s cut in half thanks to a holding penalty. The Chiefs start on their own 9. Mahomes with a nifty throw finds Watkins for a 19 yard gain. The Chiefs can get back yards quite quickly.49ers form in shotgun, he gets Coleman for four yards. On 2nd \u0026amp 6, Garoppolo targets Juszczyk again, it worked pretty well last time, and this time around it’s a 14 yard gain that brings them to the Kansas city 32. Kittle gets them another 5 yards, no flag here. On 2nd \u0026amp 5, Mostert can’t get anything, however, and Garoppolo’s next pass gets them 3 yards when they needed 5.They settle for a 42-yard field goal, which is good.Note: We should boycott every movie that uses a “spooky, slowed down” version of a pop song in their advertising campaign just so the trailer-makers come up with a second idea.Garoppolo goes to Sanders in two consecutive throws, getting the 49ers to their 36. On 1st \u0026amp 10, Samuel gets the ball and he runs for a solid 14 yards.

Long time Niners fan here...that was a bullshit call from the ump for the big pass to George Kittle just before the end of the half....robbed us of three points. Tight game...low scoring. I still think the niners can do it...just keep the rush going on Mahomes and get the running game sparked up. Last team to score wins this one. Great game!!!!It’s true, if the officials don’t call pass interference on Kittle, the 49ers had a real good shot at a successful field goal attempt. From my vantage, it was the correct call but not necessarily one that gets called 10 out of every 10 times. Email from J.R. in Illinois:I’m not a football fan but I am a massive Syd Barrett fan and was very surprised to see him mentioned earlier in this MBM. I’ve spent the entire first half puzzling over what “the most Syd Barrett National Anthem ever?” might mean but for the life of me I have no idea. Little help?-- J.R. in IllinoisI would be lying if I said I fully got it myself, but I will note that Shakira’s Whenever, Wherever, which she just performed as part of her Super Bowl medley, starts with a direct quote from Pink Floyd’s Shine On You Crazy Diamond. Which is, of course, about Syd Barrett.So perhaps it was a message from the future.The halftime show will be starting shortly. For in-depth coverage, I would recommend following the ’s No Football Liveblog.Email from Dirk van der Merwe:Following your play by play.. but was wondering: why are they playing in Miami?The Super Bowl is played on a neutral site that is chosen in advance (although, in theory, if the Miami Dolphins won the AFC they would have lucked into a home game but, uh, that wasn’t going to happen). They typically try to pick warm weather locations, because, well, it’s start of February. So, this year it was Miami.Well it’s looking like this is going to be a close one. Fast-paced too. I’d say this one looks likely to be entertaining from here on out.Now watch Mahomes like throw four unanswered touchdowns to start the third quarter.Garoppolo finds Jeff Wilson for a 20-yard gain, but there are only 14 seconds left in the half. San Francisco quickly takes a timeout. Garoppolo throws a ball super, super deep to Kittle but he gets called for pass interference for pushing off on a defender. So that will do it, this game’s going to be tied heading into halftime.The best thing about being on liveblog duty during the Super Bowl is being too busy to spend practically any time paying close attention to these awful, awful ads.Mostert picks up three yards. It’s 2nd \u0026amp 7, Mostert gets an additional two yards.Kansas City will use its first timeout.The 49ers will start at their own 20 with all three timeouts.

Each night, in a converted mansion block in central London, about 200 people pack in – often in roaring 20s fancy dress and most likely tipsy – to experience a two-and-a-half-hour production that lands somewhere between a Fitzgeraldian fantasy-scape and an office party.What was still considered a left-field artistic proposition a decade ago, popularised by the likes of Punchdrunk and dreamthinkspeak, has become one of theatre’s biggest commercial money-makers. Now, dozens of events across the UK are riding on the immersive gravy train.In Nottingham, punters can book into an experience called Flight that “will allow audience members to experience a plane crash”. In towns across England and Wales, customers can pay £55 each for a deliberately bad meal with Faulty Towers The Dining Experience.In London alone, immersive-experience hunters can choose between Jeff Wayne’s The War of The Worlds, Mamma Mia! The Party, a murder mystery by way of The Invitation or hold tight for a limited run of 18 shows in May and June of Human Traffic Live: an “immersive rave theatre experience” based on a 90s film about clubbing, set in a cavernous nightclub and charging £300 for the pleasure of VIP tickets.So, has the scene combusted and peaked?“For some producers, it’s become a licence to print money,” says Andrzej Lukowski, theatre editor for Time Out. “It’s a party night and infantilised. It’s not attempting to be high art or progressive. Theatre as an art form often tries to do something excellent and reaches for the stars even when it fails, but this current crop of immersive shows have to make money. You don’t see them striving for brilliance or pushing boundaries or doing anything genuinely meaningful.”It is a view shared by Lois Keidan, director and co-founder of Live Art Development Agency, who helped pioneer immersive theatre as an art form decades ago through influential artists such as Adrian Howells and Geraldine Pilgrim. “There is a provenance that is overlooked, where artists have taken risks and tested the form over years. Now, the experience economy has swallowed that and appropriated it for commercial gain – but that’s always the way, of course.” Why does she think the immersive industry is booming now? “Well, it’s become part of the entertainment industry,” she says. “And it’s cheaper than building a new ride at Alton Towers.”Yet audiences are clearly enthralled. Secret Cinema, which recreates favourite films as “worlds” where the audiences dress up as characters from Blade Runner, Back to the Future and so on, has become one of the most successful immersive franchises in the world. Last week, the company signed a major deal with Disney to bring its classic films to life.Brian Hook and Louis Hartshorn, the producers of Gatsby, The Wolf of Wall Street (which closed last month) and an upcoming immersive Doctor Who, say they have helped democratise the genre. “We have people coming that wouldn’t necessarily go to a West End show. We’re competing against crazy golf and escape rooms, things that people go to do as well as see,” says Hartshorn.“We originally wanted to make The Beautiful and Damned,” adds Hook, “but we felt like I couldn’t sell tickets to it – it’s not in the public mood in the same way. With a cool, hipster version of Gatsby, with the Leonardo DiCaprio film in the zeitgeist, we have been able to draw in a huge spread of experience seekers – from hen dos to school groups.”The industry is still grappling with safeguarding performers. Judging by complaints of groping and sexual misconduct in shows from Punchdrunk’s Sleep No More to Gatsby, actors may be more vulnerable to abuse when the traditional boundaries between them and the audience are breached. For their production of The Wolf of Wall Street, Hook and Hartshorn ensured the cast were equipped with personal alarm buttons.Still, both agree that the immersive-experience scene has only just got going and predict explosive growth in 2020. To that end, they have invested heavily in their own three-storey Mayfair venue dedicated to “developing and staging theatre-led immersive experiences”.“At the moment, the problem is that a lot of different work is lumped under the immersive banner,” says Hartshorn. “Maybe we need different names for different genres within it.”On this point, Lukowski agrees. “The fact that it wants to be called theatre is interesting,” he says. “It’s light interaction, drinks at the bar and a middlebrow party night. But that’s fine. If they were taking up a West End theatre you might quibble, but they’re often making use of abandoned buildings. It’s just disappointing that a lot of shows don’t have very high artistic aspirations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83b3fc2a006d5134779fb2e3728e90b414221205/59_416_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e440c3b8e3735c544cc6e059b732b98","title":"good morning britain piers morgan the wake up call we deserve","story":"ITV’s breakfast show epitomises – and fosters – the UK’s culture wars. To see for himself,  Tim Adams wakes to Piers Morgan for a monthThere were a few days in mid-December when it looked like the nation might have won some respite from its daily diet of shouty culture wars. But then, on 17 December, just days after Boris Johnson’s election victory, Piers Morgan signed his new contract with Good Morning Britain, and the most enthusiastic cheerleader of national disharmony was granted two more lucrative years behind his breakfast desk.Morgan insisted that this would be his last term of office, and that he will “sail off into the sunset” in 2022. His original tabloid mentor, Kelvin MacKenzie, argued a year ago that Morgan would not be happy until he “absolutely owns breakfast” and “is making £10m a year”. I don’t imagine he is quite there yet.In the four and a half years since Morgan took up his seat – “back by unpopular demand” – I’ve done my best to avoid watching Good Morning Britain because, well, obviously, who in their right mind wants to start the day with Morgan at their breakfast table? But in fact there is no escape. You don’t need to be among the million viewers who tune in to Good Morning Britain to feel its daily presence in your life. Anyone with an eye on this country’s media, whether print, social, broadcast, will have absorbed Morgan’s more strident opinions – about vegan sausage rolls or Donald Trump or gender identity – by osmosis.As part of a somewhat perverse new year’s resolution, for the past few weeks I have reversed my abstention, and watched Good Morning Britain – “the nation’s most talked about show” – as much as work has allowed. After the increasingly disconcerting political events of last year, I felt some need to begin the decade immersed in the nation’s prevailing gobby mood where better to start? I have come to think of this hair-shirt commitment as Morganuary.Morgan has, as you will know whether you like it or not, begun this decade as he finished the last, as the nation’s self-appointed headline-generator in chief. His long-running obsession with Meghan Markle became, as if at his personal direction, also the nation’s primary obsession: having amplified the persecution of the Duchess of Sussex, Morgan then choreographed the fallout of her escape from that persecution. Along the way there has also been the usual quota of viral sidelines. Inevitably, Morgan chimed in with Laurence Fox and his acoustic struggle to highlight the plight of white male TV celebrities, along the way explaining his definition of racism to colleagues including mixed-race weatherman Alex Beresford and guests in what GMB regulars enjoy calling “ersity corner”.Counter-intuitively, one effect of social media has been a dramatic narrowing of the range of topics that capture the collective mind. Morgan with his 7 million Twitter followers is a master of the kind of circularity that online debate demands – all links lead back to him. As Roger Ailes, creator of Fox News, observed of the so-called infotainment age: “People don’t want to be informed, they want to seem informed.” Morgan is a prime mover in that principle.I should make a very obvious point, belatedly, here: that Morgan is never alone at his Good Morning Britain desk (though he sometimes seems to believe himself to be). He is, for a start, not there at all on Thursdays and Fridays, or over the weekend. And beside him, from Monday to Wednesday, sits the unflappably charming and sane Susanna Reid, winner of numerous awards for television valour. Reid is paid more than £1m a year leaving aside the manifest absurdity of that wage, there can hardly be a regular viewer of Good Morning Britain who does not entertain the idea that she earns every penny.The industry cliche has it that news anchors are finally hired on the basis of how convincing they appear with the sound off. Reid has taken that principle to a whole new level. Though she is an incisive interviewer – witness her brilliant evisceration of Nicky Morgan talking nonsense about nurses before the election – much of her best work is nonverbal. There are YouTube compilation videos of Reid’s grimaces and eye rolls during Morgan’s never-ending monologues. “Susanna Reid dies a little inside every time Piers Morgan opens his mouth…” has nearly 800,000 views.The more you watch the pair at work, you can’t help but feel Morgan and Reid, for better and worse, dramatise precisely, depressingly, the public mood, in which those who talk loudest feel empowered to drown out those you might want to hear. Much of the time Morgan and Reid are engaged in inane banter about ratings or Gwyneth Paltrow, but arguably no television double act has better reflected a fracturing national psyche since Steptoe and Son. Just as Albert Steptoe never gave Harold’s dreams of a more civilised life a moment’s thought, so Morgan blunders over Reid’s every effort at compromise or nuance.The latter is obviously easier said than done. Take last Monday. Even in the short time I have been watching I have noticed that some mornings matter to Morgan much more than others. Mondays are particularly critical because he can set the dogs of particular items running all week. The three stories that he has decided are dominating that morning’s agenda are all out of his own back pocket, or at least he makes them seem so.First, there is the tragic death of Kobe Bryant, which for Morgan inevitably becomes an occasion for personal reminiscence of his time watching basketball in Los Angeles when he was hosting his talk show for CNN. Second, there is the latest chapter in the ongoing Meghan Markle story, a trail for another exclusive interview with Markle’s estranged father, Thomas. And finally there is the kind of “story” Morgan gets up for. This is generated by a stray comment that Hugh Grant has made in promoting his latest movie, suggesting that the December election result was “a catastrophe” and, because of Brexit, Britain “is finished”.In one of his many reflections on his decade editing the News of the World and the Mirror, Morgan once observed that “on newspapers every day is a feud. All editors need one to get by.” Morgan always needed several. Most days he rips into his current nemeses – Gary Lineker, Alastair Campbell, feminists, Meghan Markle, assorted “snowflakes”, Lord Adonis – but the feud with Grant seems more primal.As he gets into his stride about how much he despises Grant – one of Morgan’s gifts to the nation has been to normalise the idea that it is natural for presenters to own up to “loathing” and “hating the guts” of particular public figures – you are reminded that one of the moments in his career of which Morgan is most proud was the day he ran out of his office “punching the air delightedly and shrieking an order: ‘Get the hooker!’” This after Grant had been arrested with a prostitute on Sunset Boulevard.The drama of finding and buying off Divine Brown for the News of the World is presented in Morgan’s memoir, The Insider, as if he had taken possession of the Pentagon papers. Grant had the temerity not to be overly chuffed about that treatment in the News of the World, or about the fact that his phone was subsequently hacked by other journalists. Grant is many of the things that Morgan can’t abide: he went to private school and to Oxford (Morgan, who grew up with his mother and stepfather at a village pub in Sussex, was educated privately until he was 13, then went to the local comp after his family fell on harder times).Using all this stored animus, Morgan revs himself up at 6.40 to a quite alarming pitch about the romcom actor’s lack of patriotism while Reid winces silently beside him. Inevitably, an immediate poll is called for by Morgan (it is an overlooked fact that the national eitheror of Brexit was primed by countless such online barometers of staged anger). “Do you agree with Hugh Grant that Britain is finished?”It is then that Good Morning Britain’s hold on the national conversation kicks in. As you watch Morgan and Reid argue about Grant, you can also watch Morgan’s mansplaining immediately amplified in real time. Some of this comes from online reaction – unchecked outrage about Grant’s throwaway line is by now trending on Twitter – some comes from online newspaper journalists, who appear to watch Good Morning Britain in the way that their predecessors used to watch the tickertape of newswires.Hardly has Morgan half-uttered the words “Shut up” to his co-host than an online news story in the Sun is breathlessly reporting the fact: “Piers Morgan has admitted he pushes co-host Susanna Reid to her absolute limits when the pair host Good Morning Britain. This morning the pair exchanged fiery comments whilst presenting GMB live on air, signalling no end in sight to their stark differences in opinion,” the paper announced. “Susanna attempted to shut down her fellow presenter by saying: ‘I don’t want to talk about Hugh Grant any more.’ In this particular moment, Susanna knew how to wind up the former newspaper editor as he was almost caught saying ‘Shut up’ on camera. He let out a ‘Shu–’ before quickly correcting himself…”By now I am far enough into Morganuary that it can seem that no reporting of a world event is complete without input from Morgan. There is a genuine weirdness in watching this unfold. Morgan writes newspaper columns for the Mail and the Mail on Sunday. There was a time when that would have meant that rival tabloid newspapers would have operated a blanket ban on coverage of him. Now, perversely, certain rival online editors appear to work on the principle that if a tree falls in a forest and Piers Morgan has not tweeted about it, has it really happened?Here, for example, is how the Express – ostensibly the biggest rival to the Mail for the hearts and minds of middle England – first reported the tragedy of the helicopter crash in which basketball legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter died: “Piers Morgan pays tribute to ‘icon’ Kobe Bryant after death aged 41” the Express headline reads. And this is how the story that follows is constructed: “PIERS MORGAN took to Twitter alongside many celebrities to pay tribute to basketball legend Kobe Bryant, who has passed away at the age of 41… The Good Morning Britain presenter, 54, shared a photo of the basketball star in his Lakers kit and wrote in view of his 7.1 million Twitter followers: ‘Few bigger icons in the history of world sport than Kobe Bryant.’”This habit of filtering world events through Morgan’s eyes is very far from an isolated case. On Monday morning there are by my count at least a dozen clickbait stories in the papers featuring Morgan’s reaction to the world. The previous week, in the Express alone, I had counted 16.Does any of this matter? It used to be observed – partly because of the grounding principles of the BBC in our media – that something like Fox News, which set the tone for the extremist populism of Trump, could never gain a foothold in this country. With BBC news under siege from all sides, Good Morning Britain, operating in that no man’s land between news and highly partisan presenter-dominated comment, goes some way to proving the opposite.Morgan’s main opponent in this war is consensus. Increasingly of course, that means he casts himself as the defender of “common sense” and plain speaking in straw-man arguments about whether “clapping should be replaced with ‘jazz hands’ to make it more inclusive” or in rants about plus-sized models, gender-neutral clothing or men carrying babies in papooses.“Culture war” seems a grandiose term for what Good Morning Britain does. But the effect is to add to that pervasive impression that public life is a zero sum game in which for me to win, you have to lose. Morgan jokes continuously about his rival morning show on the BBC (which brings in twice the viewers but emits a fraction of the “noise”). “I want to destroy them, I want to dismantle them, I want to wreck them,” he says, only partly tongue in cheek.We might think of this kind of tone as an invention of cable networks and shock jocks in the United States. If you trace its history closely, however, the language of Breitbart and Fox News – that mixture of laddish mischief and bigoted cruelty – was lifted wholesale from the Sun and the News of the World in the 1970s and 80s. Rupert Murdoch first injected it into the American bloodstream in the pages of the New York Post, and then into television through Ailes’s Fox News. The lowest common denominator principle was to “Give people what they want”.Morgan was in many ways the wunderkind of that impulse. In 1994, Murdoch scenting an ambition he could work with, promoted 28-year-old Morgan from being editor of the Sun’s celebrity gossip column, Bizarre, to the editorship of the planet’s most read paper, the News of the World. He no doubt sensed that Morgan understood, at heart, that profit should always come before principle. Morgan tested that idea a couple of times, most notably in his bold anti-war stance while editor of the Mirror at the time of the invasion of Iraq. A crash in sales, however, saw him send a note of apology to his then boss, Sly Bailey. “One thing I won’t be doing is sitting here defiantly telling myself how I’m right and they are all wrong,” he wrote. “The readers are never wrong. Repulsive maybe, but never wrong.”That definitive populist wisdom is something Morgan has carried with him ever since the sense that news was a business, or a game played with public sentiment, and one that you would be a mug not to play to win. “Sometimes the job does feel a bit like playing God with people’s lives,” he said of his time at the News of the World. “I get, ultimately, to decide every week who lives and who dies by the NoW sword… The obvious glee with which my newsdesk rehearse the weekly stories of misery and mayhem created by our revelations slightly unnerves, as well as excites.”That excitement has never quite left Morgan, even now he slurps his tea for the breakfast cameras. He would like you to believe that most of it is for show, these days, and that perhaps it always was.In interviews, he says: “My persona in public is a slight pantomime villain. I constantly fuel this because it’s fun, it’s entertaining, it’s provocative, it gets everybody going, it encourages debate. All the things I like.”The thing he most doesn’t like is the suggestion that any of that villainy might ever have been for real. Morgan has long performed triple-salchows on the thinnest of ice around the hacking scandal that led to the closure of the News of the World, and 14 criminal convictions. By his own admission before the Leveson inquiry, he knew about illegal voicemail hacking some years before it became a public outrage but he has always strongly denied any involvement in the practice. These denials have never been tested before a jury because his former employer, Mirror Group – now Reach plc – has preferred to settle any claims out of court – £70m has been set aside to cover compensation payments and legal fees and significant sums have already been paid out.Two live cases may yet require Morgan to answer more legal questions. Princess Diana’s former lover, James Hewitt, is suing Mirror Group for damages arising from unlawful information gathering during Morgan’s time as editor at the Mirror, while Prince Harry also has a suit pending against the Mirror and the Sun on similar grounds.Morgan did not mention that latter case in the latest instalment of his headline-making interview with Thomas Markle on Monday, though he was once again pointedly critical of Meghan’s recourse to the courts in her privacy battle against another of his employers, the Mail on Sunday. He did not feel the need to highlight any conflict of interest.When news of Hewitt’s suit against the Mirror was tweeted by Hugh Grant, Morgan was, as ever, however, quick to respond:“Great! Always wanted to get the Major into court so we can discuss his treasonous adultery with the wife of our future king. This will be fun! Ps Just a reminder, again, ‘Saint’ Hugh – one of us has a criminal record, and it’s not me. So stick your moralising up your a**.”Watching Morgan at breakfast over a period of time, and despite all his self-mockery, that old tabloid nastiness is never too far from the surface. Though by all accounts an affable and charming colleague and friend, in his professional life, even at 7am, he retains the right to a bully’s instinct for taking advantage of vulnerability. That instinct, which he exploits more effectively than any other journalist in our tribal times, drives attention where he wants it: towards him. He knows how to feed that playground impulse that made you run toward a scrap when the cry of “Fight!” went up.On Wednesday morning, Morgan was obsessing about his no-show at the National Television awards, and slagging off another of his hate figures, David Walliams. I watched Reid trying to get a word in edgeways, and felt her lucrative pain a few times when she had to give up. I could sense my resolve to keep my Morganuary habit going into our post-Brexit February waning. As with all new year’s resolutions, a month suddenly seemed like more than enough.Author Afua Hirsch is asked to defend her New York Times piece “Black Britons know why Meghan Markle wants out – it’s the racism”.“You can’t just say these things are racist when they’re not,” Morgan froths.‘I’m telling you that as someone who’s lived the experience of being a person of African heritage in this country that there are narratives that are regularly…” Hirsch replies, before being cut off by her host.A discussion about “Harry and Meghan’s new life” becomes another robust debate about whether the treatment of the couple by the UK media had been racist. Morgan says not. This prompts lawyer and activist Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu to say: “You are a man privileged to have power and influence, and you’re using your power so irresponsibly to spout some personal vendetta with nasty and vile comments.”Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy also ends up having to fact-check Morgan’s view that race and gender were not a factor in the media’s treatment of Meghan Markle. “If you don’t mind me saying, how on earth would you know?” she counters. “As someone who’s never had to deal with ingrained prejudice, you’re not in a position to understand people who have.”He also picks a fight with GMB’s mixed-race weather presenter, Alex Beresford, about, you guessed it, race and Meghan Markle.After saying he had been championing the anti-woke frontman and Question Time celebrity Laurence Fox, Morgan clashes with him over Fox’s comments that the inclusion of a Sikh soldier in the film 1917 was “forcing ersity on people”. Morgan points out that he was “sort of insulting, actually, to Sikh soldiers who had served”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/087f880d37aa5a0dafcf6416205c544fd33d58b7/0_71_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b15f0acd9e871756e20a7577fc1619b8","title":"jared kushner middle east peace plan","story":"Though the Palestinian Authority has cut ties with the US and Israel over the Trump administration’s plan for Middle East peace, its author has insisted his plan is not dead yet.Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, spoke to CNN on Friday for an interview broadcast on Sunday.Insisting he had made “a real offer on the table to break the logjam”, Kushner said: “What we hope that they’ll do is read the plan.At an Arab League meeting in Cairo on Saturday, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said he had “informed the Israeli side … that there will be no relations at all with them and the United States including security ties”.Abbas said he had refused to discuss the peace plan with Trump by phone, or to receive even a copy to study, because he did not want Trump to be able to say he had been consulted.Kushner’s 180-page plan, three years in the making, was presented at the White House on Tuesday and endorsed by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who appeared with Trump in Washington.It calls for the creation of a demilitarised Palestinian state that would exclude Jewish settlements in occupied territory and remain under near-total Israeli security control. The plan also outlines potential economic assistance for Palestinians but places stringent conditions on it achieving statehood.CNN host Fareed Zakaria pointed to page 34, which “says the predicate condition to a Palestinian state being recognised is that there must be a free press free elections guarantees of religious freedom an independent judiciary financial institutions that are as good, transparent and as effective as in the western world and the US and Israel will judge whether the Palestinians have achieved this.”Suggesting “no Arab country would meet these criteria – certainly not Saudi Arabia or Egypt”, countries with which the Trump administration has “worked very closely”, Zakaria asked: “Isn’t this just a way of telling the Palestinians, you’re never actually going to get a state? Because … effectively it’s a killer amendment.”Refusing to discuss the comparison with Saudi Arabia, Kushner replied: “So are you saying that we shouldn’t have these criteria?”The Trump peace plan also proposes US recognition of Israeli settlements on occupied West Bank land and of Jerusalem as Israel’s inisible capital.In Cairo, Abbas reiterated his “complete” rejection of the plan, saying: “I will not have it recorded in my history that I sold Jerusalem.”Kushner called the Palestinian leader “a man who does want peace” but added: “He’s in the 16th year of a four-year term. So it’s not exactly a thriving democracy in that regard.”Abbas, 84, took office in January 2005. In December 2009 his term was extended until any new elections were held.Palestinians had to see they had been offered a reasonable deal, Kushner said.“What they did is they rejected this before it came out,” he said. “They called for a day of rage, and they’re saying, we want a state. But people who are ready to get a state aren’t calling for days of rage and then marching in the street.”He also said the US had tried to “take a pragmatic approach” to “probably the most complicated problem in the world”.“We’ve tried to do it differently, and I think that for the first time there’s a real offer on the table to break the logjam. And it’s really up to the Palestinians to see if they have the opportunity to pursue it.”In Cairo, Arab League foreign ministers said the plan did not meet the minimum aspirations of Palestinians and the League would not cooperate in implementing it.They also affirmed Palestinian rights to create a state based on land captured and occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, with East Jerusalem as capital."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfdff757d00b19be1bd7ae36a10716c960fc6d5b/19_141_5434_3260/master/5434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=493415cda448351e3377e09f0623c2cf","title":"bosphorus amateur ship spotters reveal global power struggles","story":"They’re up before dawn to track traffic on the busy strait – and their sightings of warships can help to predict Russian strategy. The Observer meets ‘a nerdy little community’The Bosphorus, the magnificent strait iding Istanbul in two, is named after Io, a mortal lover of the god Zeus, who was cursed by his wife Hera to wander the earth in the form of a white heifer: the name comes from the Greek boûs, cow, and poros, passage.Io may have been the first to cross the waterway iding Europe from Asia, but she was certainly not the last. As the route from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, the Bosphorus offers enormous geopolitical power to whoever controls it. The city of Constantinople was founded on either side of its shores, successively the seat of the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires. Today, the Bosphorus breathes calmly and quietly beneath the hills of modern Istanbul, but its waters are still full of international intrigue.Alongside the thousands of passenger ferries, oil tankers and cargo boats that make this waterway one of the busiest in the world, the comings and goings of warships on the Bosphorus can predict events in volatile places as far away as Syria, Libya and Venezuela. As a result, the traffic is monitored obsessively by the channel’s self-appointed  – a warm and funny bear of a man called Yörük Işık.Işık, born in Istanbul, has been in love with the Bosphorus his whole life. He is one of the city’s handful of passionate ship spotters who in recent years have realised that their hobby is of interest to diplomats and intelligence agencies all over the world.Last Saturday, Işık was up before dawn in pursuit of something special. Wrapped up against the wind on the open-top deck of a ferry, he kept his hands warm in his pockets as the winter sun began to dance on the water and the boat left the wooden mansions of the middle-class neighbourhood of Emirgan behind.“I end up doing this at all hours of the night and day when I’m looking for something,” the 48-year-old said. “It drives my wife mad sometimes. But it’s totally worth it for the right ship.”Equipped with a powerful zoom lens donated by the local Reuters bureau after it got a bit too battered in war zones, Işık leapt up to photograph a pod of dolphins (“always nice”) and a passing Turkish submarine (“a rare treat”). But the prize, the Russian patrol ship Dmitriy Rogachev, didn’t come into view around the Bosphorus’s narrow bends.Under the terms of a 1936 international treaty, the Bosphorus is open to all civilian boats during peacetime, as well as naval ships belonging to its Black Sea neighbours. The treaty reestablished Turkish control of the strait but ensured Soviet dominance of the inland sea. Today it gives Russian ships stationed there access to the wider world.“It was always fascinating to me to watch the Russian and Nato ships when I was growing up,” Işık said. “Turkish media has become less and less reliable, so I decided to set up my blog as a citizen journalist. But it was only when Russia decided to intervene in the Syrian war in 2015 that people outside our nerdy little community really started paying attention.Warships are allowed to turn off their GPS tracking devices and commercial boats contracted by navies often give false destinations, making Işık’s work akin to that of an international relations detective, piecing together where ships went, for how long, and why.His most famous photo, taken in 2015, showed a Russian soldier on the top deck of a huge landing ship holding a shoulder-launched missile as he sailed through the heart of a city home to 16 million people.Ankara was furious at the provocation, which further damaged the two countries’ already tense relationship after Turkey shot down a Russian jet on the Syrian border it said had violated its airspace.The elusive Dmitriy Rogachev was on Işık’s radar last week because a fellow ship spotter in Sevastopol had messaged to say he believed the Russian warship had left the Black Sea for the first time. Any pictures he could take would be the first proof of the ship in active service outside Russian waters, probably en route to the Syrian port of Latakia.Over the last five years, as Russia has begun to reassert itself as a major player in Middle Eastern politics, such movements hold the key to understanding where and how Moscow wants to send soldiers and equipment to project its power. Other Russian vessels, loaded with wheat and other goods, have made their way through the Bosphorus for Venezuela, where Moscow supports a government struggling with an economic crash.Watching Turkey’s maritime movements, too, is becoming more and more important since Ankara’s recent agreement to come to the aid of the UN-recognised government in Libya.Işık and his fellow ship spotters watched with interest the arrival of the Lebanese-flagged Bana, which arrived in Istanbul’s Haydarpaşa port on 11 December and left again with its destination set as Beirut. It actually sailed to the Libyan city of Misrata, arriving on 1 January.The Turkish parliament didn’t approve military assistance until 2 January, leading to speculation the carrier actually transported equipment from Istanbul for the Turkish military build-up before the vote took place.“Our planet is mostly made up of water. It’s what connects everything,” said Devrim Yaylalı, 49, another ship spotter. The two men are friends united by their love of the Bosphorus.“When a ship leaves its berth for the open sea it goes over the horizon, out of sight and out of mind. Istanbul is unique because they have to come so close to the city, even if they don’t stop. Ship spotting here gives you an insight into what the world looks like outside your own little part of it. It’s an inherently political hobby.”There isn’t much in Turkey that doesn’t have a political dimension. Last month President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan revived plans to in effect create a second Bosphorus – a 45km canal to be built west of the natural waterway that the government says will ease the heavy traffic on the Bosphorus and reduce the risk of accidents.First announced in 2011, the proposed Istanbul canal is the most ambitious of dozens of the president’s infrastructure megaprojects that have come to define modern Turkey’s economic boom and bust.The £9.5bn plan was put on hold in 2018 when the Turkish lira crashed. Its reintroduction has prompted concern from environmentalists and Turkish opposition parties, which have warned costs will spiral.“The Sea of Marmara has a very delicately balanced oxygenation system and it is already struggling with the changes caused by the rapid expansion of the city of Istanbul in the last few decades,” said Cemal Saydam, a professor of environmental engineering at Ankara’s Hacettepe University.“To connect the two seas like this would reduce oxygen levels enough to kill all life in the Sea of Marmara. That kind of mistake cannot be undone.”Neighbouring Black Sea states have been left to wonder what the proposed canal will mean for the balance of power in the region. Turkish officials have insisted that the 1936 Montreux Convention governing use of the Bosphorus will not apply to the new canal, meaning Turkey could in theory allow whatever ships it likes – including US warships – passage to the Black Sea, effectively militarising the currently Russian-dominated waters.Işık echoes the environmental concerns over the project, but at the same time can’t help but wonder what new dimensions it might bring to his hobby.Around 4pm, seven hours later than expected, the powerful silhouette of the Dmitriy Rogachev finally appeared at the mouth of the Bosphorus.The grey warship dwarfed the tiny Turkish coastguard tugboat sent to accompany it, which bobbed up and down in the larger ship’s wake. The Russian vessel quickly powered past the gardens of the Topkapı palace towards the open sea on its first voyage into the wider world.“What did I tell you?” Işık said. “Totally worth it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eda1fb38572e0d2c252dd25f6f1f82e9206a1a5/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bb5431dae9ae1263ee2d4f4133132a9","title":"coronavirus 11 more uk nationals to be flown back from china dominic raab","story":"Foreign secretary confirms evacuation as Philippines reports first death outside ChinaDominic Raab has confirmed that 11 evacuees will be flown to the UK from the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday, on a French-chartered plane, after they missed a previous evacuation flight on Friday.The foreign secretary said the government was doing everything in its power to help Britons who wished to leave but that the process posed serious challenges.“We’ll do everything we can to make sure that those that still want to leave, give them the opportunity to do so,” he said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.“The challenge that we’ve got, and the Chinese have got frankly, is to contain the virus but also then to lift out people that want to come back home and we’re doing that as sensitively and as effectively as we can.”The second group of evacuees - made up of British nationals and family members - boarded a French flight and will also be brought to Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral where they will spend 14 days in quarantine, Raab said.Mr Raab had said 11 British nationals would be returning but the Foreign Office later confirmed the group includes a mix of British nationals and some of their relatives.He said the Government is doing all it can to help Britons in Wuhan leave if they want to.Raab’s comments came as the Philippines reported the first death from coronavirus outside China, where 304 have died since it was first detected, and the first people to be tested positive for the virus in the UK continue to be treated at a special unit at a hospital in Newcastle.The Department of Health on Sunday confirmed 266 tests have been carried out in the UK for coronavirus and that 264 have been confirmed negative.The UK government had been expecting that 200 people would be on Friday’s chartered flight, but when it left Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, only 83 Britons were onboard.Earlier, on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Raab said those flown back would join the other 83 evacuees in quarantine conditions in Arrowe Park, on the Wirral in north-west England.Asked why more people were not flown out on Friday, Raab listed some of the difficulties UK diplomats have faced negotiating with Chinese officials. He said: “The challenge has been immense. You’ll know that Hubei province is nine times the size of Wales.“We had a job to do to get permissions for the charter flight going in, then the permissions to get the roadblocks eased for the UK nationals to get to the muster points. We had four coaches put on, and we delayed the original flight by three hours on the tarmac to try and make sure as many people could get out that wanted to get out.”He added: “As this flight with the French shows, we will continue to work for those that didn’t make the first flight to give them the cooperation, the support and reassurance that we can help them as best we can.”Britons still stranded in Wuhan have said confusing messages from officials contributed to them missing Friday’s evacuation flight home.Chris Hill, 38, said he had refused to board the flight back to the UK because because the Foreign Office could not confirm whether his four-year-old daughter, a Chinese national, would be allowed to join him.Hill, from Sunderland, said his wife of 11 years could not travel as she was needed to work in a hospital in Wuhan, and he could not consider leaving his family. He criticised the planning of the flight, saying he was given only seven minutes’ notice to arrive at the airport.“There’s no cars, there’s no taxis, anything, and the FCO say, ‘Oh we’ll pick you up from Wuhan Tianhe airport but you have to make your own way there.’ That gives me a very bad taste in my mouth. It’s just bad planning.”One British man in the city said he had been offered a place on a French evacuation flight, but told of his fears of being left stranded in the city after deciding he could not leave his wife, who is a nurse, behind when she could not get the time off workA spokesman for the Foreign Office said: “The government is in touch with British nationals who remain in Wuhan, and are doing everything we can to bring them home as safely and quickly as possible.”Meanwhile, more than 240 calls have been made to a dedicated helpline in York after a student at the city’s university was confirmed as having the coronavirus.The University of York set up a call centre on Saturday after confirming one of the first two confirmed UK cases of the virus was a student.In a statement on Sunday, University of York vice-chancellor Professor Charlie Jeffery and representatives from the Chinese Students and Scholars Association said the student did not attend a university Chinese New Year celebration or recent graduation ceremonies.They said as soon as the student’s relative showed symptoms, they contacted emergency services and were both taken to the specialist medical facility in Newcastle, where they were diagnosed with the virus.A spokesman said the university remains open as usual and stressed that it will continue to monitor the situation.He added: “We reiterate Public Health England’s assurance that the risk level to our staff and students remains low.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3874c48b60c19700154945c030a400899b62a52e/0_112_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f36dd7b83a1122fa74359f71b9e6aa1c","title":"galapagos experts find a tortoise related to lonesome george","story":"Thirty tortoises partially descended from extinct species found, including one of same species as famed inidualConservationists working around the largest volcano on the Galápagos Islands say they have found 30 giant tortoises partially descended from two extinct species, including that of the famed Lonesome George.The Galápagos national park and Galápagos Conservancy said one young female had a direct line of descent from the Chelonoidis abingdonii species of Pinta island. The last of those tortoises was Lonesome George, who died in June 2012 and was believed to be more than 100 years old.Another 11 males and 18 females were from the Chelonoidis niger line of Floreana island.The 45-member expedition was working around the Wolf volcano on Isabela island. It said pirates and whalers had taken tortoises from other islands in the archipelago and left them near the volcano.Those found during the latest expedition were hybrids descended from both the extinct and other species.The Galápagos is a volcanic archipelago and province of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean. The islands, whose variety of endemic species helped inspire Charles Darwin, were home to 15 closely related species of tortoise, according to the Conservancy, which estimates that 20,000-25,000 wild tortoises live there.

Many Dubliners scoff at mention of the family.But the Healy-Raes, who hold three county council seats and two seats in parliament, tend to have the last laugh. They are savvy populists who have not lost an election since entering politics four decades ago – a remarkable record given the fact they run as independents.They appear poised for fresh victories in the general election on 8 February – and could end up in government. The more Dublin snickers, it seems, the better for the Healy-Raes, who alchemise metropolitan disdain into votes at home.“If people in certain sections of society want to laugh at or insult me they’re insulting the people that support me as well,” said Michael Healy-Rae, 53, who is running for re-election as a member of parliament. “And they’re insulting a way of life that we have not just in Kerry but in other parts of rural Ireland.”He depicted Dublin as a distant, aloof capital. “I’m very sorry that rural Ireland has been attacked and attacked by the past government and the one before it.”Railing at established parties and urban elites has served populists well in Latin America, the US, continental Europe and Brexit Britain.The Healy-Raes add some twists to the playbook, turning Kerry, a mountainous landscape in south-western Ireland known as the kingdom, into a unique political laboratory. The family has elevated patronage and personal connection – venerable traditions in Irish politics – to high art. “The first commandment in Healy-Rae land is: thou shalt not turn off thy mobile phone,” Donal Hickey, a local journalist, wrote in a biography of the family.The dynasty started with Jackie Healy-Rae, a farmer and county councillor who quit the Fianna Fáil party, won a Dáil seat in 1997 and distilled the Kerry-man archetype – flat cap, melodic accent, folksy phraseology – into a potent formula.His sons Michael and Danny, the family’s other MPs, emulate their late father’s approach to helping constituents 247 with matters big and small – medical cards, heating allowances, cataracts, planning permissions, phone bills, internet connection. A permanent campaign.“Whoever does you a turn, vote for them,” said Joan Hunt, 74, a pensioner. Michael Barry, 51, another constituent, said Michael Healy-Rae facilitated a hip operation for his father. “He always kept in touch.”Jerry Behan, 62, who owns a pub in Listowel where Michael Healy-Rae holds a weekly clinic, said the campaign against drink-driving laws was part of a wider effort to tackle loneliness, depopulation and economic atrophy. “There used to be 52 pubs here, now there are 18. The government doesn’t understand rural Ireland. Michael does. He’s fighting for us.”Michael and Danny Healy-Rae have a kinetic schedule of constituency clinics, canvasses, speeches, media interviews, ribbon-cuttings, lobbying – and funerals, lots of funerals.Irish politicians often show up at wakes, removals and burials but the Healy-Raes attend so many they are said to have the gift of bilocation. “I don’t think Michael has ever missed a funeral,” said Behan.The  reported in 2016 that the Healy-Raes bring their own pens – green and red – so their names stand out when they sign condolence books.Michael, speaking at the Horseshoe while eating lunch at warp speed, said he attended out of respect, not politics. “I never in my life went to the funeral of someone I didn’t know or that I wasn’t associated with. When my friends pass away it’s a respectful thing to go to their funerals. I’ve lots of friends.”A leaked 2015 strategy paper from the Fine Gael party said the independent MP, a wealthy farmer and businessman, hid behind “the veneer of a friendlysimple country yokel” and was electorally “unbeatable”. A year later he won more votes than any other MP.For next week’s election, Michael and Danny have issued colour-coded maps detailing how each town, hamlet and street should vote in the multiple seat constituency to ensure the brothers prevail - and potentially hold leverage over the next coalition government.Videos tailored for social media show adroit use of humour, mash-ups and memes. The campaign has gone smoothly despite two of Michael’s sons – one of them a councillor – being recently convicted of assaulting a British tourist during a row at a chip van.Denis Meehan, 53, a canvasser, said Michael would win on a tide of gratitude. “Every house that we go to, he’s had something done. He’s a fierce man for rural Ireland.” Sneering from Dublin only fortified support, he said.Nevertheless, not everyone is a fan. “He’s a mighty talker,” said Tim Buckley, 70, a farmer. “But you get sick of that thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848bd402a4de01d3fc24c8acc6929e68e526beca/58_0_3384_2031/master/3384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d95c69acea8ec08c63e0a6f1b4bac3c7","title":"zoos time shut down conservation education wild animals","story":"Cruel or kind? Education and conservation are cited as reasons for keeping wild animals in captivity, but many critics say zoos are outdated relics of a less enlightened era. We hear what both sides sayIn a few days, a pair of two-year-old cheetahs, Saba and Nairo, will depart from the UK on a remarkable journey. The brothers will be taken from Howletts Wild Animal Park, in Kent, and flown to South Africa to begin a new life – in the wild.It will be the first time that cheetahs born in captivity have left the UK for rewilding in Africa, says Damian Aspinall, who runs Howletts. “There are only about 7,000 cheetahs left on the planet and they are listed as vulnerable,” he says. “This reintroduction – to a reserve in Mount Camdeboo, in south of the country – is important because it will help to support the small population of cheetahs we have left in the wild.”And the process of releasing animals from his wildlife parks is likely to continue unabated, adds Aspinall. He now campaigns vigorously for a sharp acceleration in the return of all captive animals to the wild and, ultimately, the closure of all zoos and wildlife parks in the UK – including his own.“We have no moral right as a species to let animals suffer just because we are curious about them,” he says.The day of the zoo is over, he claims – and his views are reflected by other critics who view wildlife parks and animal collections as anachronisms that should be phased out of existence over the coming 25 years.Yet zoos are a major part of British culture. About 30 million visits are made to animal collections every year, according to the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Some of these outfits are small and isolated – and occasionally fall foul of local authorities for their mistreatment of animals. On the other hand, some larger institutions, such as London or Chester zoos – are well-run and, according to supporters, justify their existence for three clear reasons: education, research and conservation.According to this argument, revealing the wonders of our planet’s wildlife to the public, and investigating the biology of these animals in order to help them return to nature provide zoos with valid reason to exist. In a world beset by climate change, habitat loss and soaring human numbers, zoos provide protection for the world’s endangered species.So who is right? Is there any justification, today, for keeping wild animals in captivity? Are zoos good for the planet’s threatened creatures – or are they relics of past cruel attitudes to wildlife?One argument is that zoos educate visitors, particularly younger ones, about the wonders of the planet’s wildlife. But Chris Draper of Born Free, the international charity that campaigns against keeping wild animals in captivity, disagrees. “Today, people get more from a TV nature documentary than they will ever get from seeing animals in zoos. In captivity, an elephant or a giraffe is out of its natural environment and probably in an unnatural social grouping. Television or the internet are much better resources for understanding animals than a zoo.”Aspinall agrees. “David Attenborough’s programmes are far more educational than a day trip to a zoo,” he says. And you can see their point. Attenborough’s last series, Seven Worlds, One Planet, was made up of typically stunning material – dramatic close-ups of gentoo penguins fleeing leopard seals, pumas in pursuit of guanacos, and Barbary macaques in high-level chases after infant kidnappers. It was exhilarating, informative – and surely ideal for getting people hooked on animals.But Attenborough flatly disagrees and is emphatic that his documentaries cannot compare to seeing the real thing. Only the sight of a creature in the flesh can give us a true understanding of its nature, he says.“There is no way you can appreciate the quiddity of an elephant except by seeing one at close quarters,” he told the Observer. “People ought to be able to see what an animal looks like. And smells like. And sounds like. I think that is quite important. Actually, very important.”Education certainly justifies a well-run zoo’s existence, he insists. On the other hand, Attenborough acknowledges that some animals fare better than others in zoos. “Modern aquariums are particularly successful, with their vast ceiling-high tanks in which you can see whole communities of different species of fish living together. They are absolutely fabulous.”By contrast, polar bears, big raptors and large hunting mammals like lions are not suitable for being kept in zoos, says Attenborough. “I certainly agree with Mr Aspinall in saying you should not have lions in zoos – unless they were becoming endangered in the wild, which, of course is now becoming a real risk.”And the same goes for conservation, he adds. “Breeding programmes for animals that are on the verge of extinction are of incredible importance. If it was not for zoos, there would be no Arabian oryx left in the world, for example.”The Arabian oryx was hunted to extinction in the wild by 1972 but was later reintroduced – originally with animals from San Diego safari park – to Oman. Further reintroductions have since taken place in Saudi Arabia and Israel and iIt is estimated that there are now more than 1,000 Arabian oryx in the wild.Other species reintroduced to the wild using zoo-bred animals include the European bison and Przewalski’s horse. But that is about it, argues Aspinall. “Only a very small number of animals held by European zoos have been the subject of release projects, and third of those species were not rated as threatened,” he says. Instead, zoos are cluttered with unthreatened species put there purely to entertain the public: otters and meerkats are common examples.However, zoo officials reject the idea that their rewilding successes are limited and point to other examples of successfully returning zoo-bred animals to the wild – for example, the Mauritius kestrel. In 1974 only four of these beautiful raptors were known to exist in the wild. It had become the world’s rarest bird thanks to habitat loss, introduction of non-native predators, and widespread use of DDT and other pesticides on the island.A rescue plan was launched by a number of organisations, including the Durrell wildlife park and London Zoo, in a bid to save the Mauritius kestrel from extinction in the wild. “The invasive crab-eating macaque was a particular problem,” says Gary Ward, curator of birds at London Zoo. “It had arrived in Mauritius from Asia and was stealing eggs from kestrel nests. So we designed nesting boxes that were longer than a macaque’s arm, so they couldn’t reach in to snatch eggs. The birds then had a safe place to bring up their young.”Nesting boxes, in combination with other conservation measures, allowed numbers of Mauritius kestrels to rise to about 800 – although these have dipped slightly in recent years.Other zoo-led rewilding successes have ranged from the spectacular, such as the Californian condor which was restored to the skies above the western US last century, thanks to the release of young birds bred in San Diego – to the minuscule, such as the return of the tiny partula snail, native to Huahine and Moorea in the Society Islands, French Polynesia, from populations bred in London, Edinburgh, Chester and Amsterdam zoos.However, zoo opponents argue that these reintroductions remain infrequent and do not justify the keeping of other, unthreatened wild animals, a point taken up by Sam Threadgill of Freedom for Animals, which has campaigned for the abolition of zoos for several decades.“It is a simple fact that the vast majority of animals kept in zoos are not endangered or threatened and are there simply to provide public entertainment,” he says.Aspinall goes further. He maintains that many large mammals kept in zoos – lions, elephants, and rhinos, for example – are inbred or diseased or have the wrong genetic profiles to reintroduce to the wild, where they could further weaken wild populations already struggling to survive. “So why are they being ‘arked’ in the first place?” he asks.The infrequency of releases of zoo-bred animals into the wild is acknowledged by Dominic Jermey, director general of the Zoological Society of London, but interpreted in a different way: “The truth is that many ‘wild’ areas are no longer viable habitats for animals – and reintroduction is much more complicated than people might realise. Many of the world’s most threatened species are living in habitats degraded by agriculture, threatened by disease or hemmed into tiny areas with no way of reaching potential mates without coming into conflict with humans.”For his part, Aspinall points to conservation successes that he believes can be achieved with key endangered species without any input from zoos. First, he plans to gradually empty his two zoos – at Howletts and at Port Lympne, near Folkestone – and use these to help set up large groups of animals – gorillas, rhinos, lions and others – in protected reserves in Africa. “A particular animal would be given homes at several reserves so that if one got into trouble for some reason – civil war, for example – there would be other sources that could resupply the reserve once those troubles had been sorted.”Aspinall points to the example of the mountain gorilla. Their numbers had fallen to under 250 by the early 1980s. Today the population stands at 1,000. “This is in the country of Gabon, surrounded by aggressive habitat destruction, civil war and poaching – and all done without any captive breeding.”The crucial point of this plan is that animals would not be kept behind bars but left to roam in their homeland. And instead of money being spent on zoos, funds would go directly to conservation.But the idea of closing zoos to boost funds for conservation is challenged by Mark Pilgrim, chief executive of Chester Zoo. His organisation has a total annual budget of £47m.“That money is raised virtually entirely from people paying at our doors to get in,” he says. “After you deduct our running costs and cash for new development, we have around £1.5m and that goes on conservation in the field – work that includes studies of chimpanzees in Nigeria and sun bears in Asia and a programme to reintroduce eastern black rhinos to Uganda. If we simply closed our doors, as some people have suggested, our funding of these conservation projects would come to an immediate halt.”He quotes as an example Nigeria’s Gashaka Gumti national park, which houses the last reserve of the highly endangered Nigerian-Cameroon chimpanzee. “Chimpanzees here live in forests that are less dense and drier than where other members of the species live in other parts of Africa,” says Andrew Moss, a lead conservation scientist at Chester. “Their diets are rich in insects, and we have found they are amazingly adept at making tools that are just right for getting a different type of insect.“The crucial point is that if we had closed our gates at Chester, the research camp we support at Gashaka Gumti would have been badly hit and this crucial field work threatened.”Nor is it merely money for conservation work that makes zoos important, say supporters. Expertise built up in zoos is also crucial. Over the past few years, wild vulture populations in India and Nepal have crashed from about 40 million to a few thousand because of the use of diclofenac, a livestock anti-inflammatory drug that is highly poisonous to vultures who eat their carcasses.“We have been closely involved in conservation work, and our expertise in building aviaries on site to protect the last few vultures – and in treating sick animals – has been tremendously useful,” says Nic Masters, assistant director of wildlife health at London Zoo.In the end, these efforts and other attempts at conservation may prove futile in a world challenged by climate change, habitat loss and swelling numbers of humans, as Draper argues. “Keeping alive a handful of the last of a sub-species starts to look like fool’s errand because this tiny population is destined either to a life in captivity in perpetuity or to extinction. Neither of those two options is particularly attractive in anyone’s book, I would say. The damage has been done.”This view is contested by scientists who still believe there is time to save species and who argue, strenuously, that zoos have a role to play as arks for threatened wildlife. This idea is backed by primatologist Jane Goodall, whose pioneering studies of chimpanzees in the wild have revealed the complex lives led by humanity’s closest biological relatives.“Groups who believe all zoos should be closed have not spent the time I have out in the wild,” she once said. “They haven’t seen the threats destroying chimpanzee habitat they don’t understand what it’s like to watch a chimp struggle, wounded and lame from a wire snare. But I do.”Until the early 19th century, collections of exotic animals were usually owned by kings and queens and were symbols of royal power. This changed with the establishment of the Zoological Society of London in Regent’s Park in 1828. This was the world’s first scientific zoo and was intended to be a collection of unusual beasts for scientific study.The collection was eventually opened to the public in 1847. A couple of decades later, the music hall song Walking in the Zoo was made popular by Alfred Vance and is notable for first popularising, in Britain, the word “zoo” as a short form of “zoological gardens” in addition to the Americanism “O.K.” in the song’s chorus: “Walking in the Zoo, walking in the ZooThe O.K. thing on Sunday is walking in the Zoo.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36b904d767cf56c42aa22bef9421e5a405bd5777/10_145_3475_2085/master/3475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa074051f6bd7cc33e118ac22d3fb996","title":"world celebrates palindrome day on 02022020","story":"Sunday’s date is considered special because it is exactly the same written both in the DDMMYYYY format as well as the US standard It’s the date the world has been waiting for, for more than 900 years.

Photograph: Dave MeehanTeachers who are not part of the trade union behind Tuesday’s one-day secondary school strike will need to register their attendance at schools in order to be paid, according to Government instructions.At least half of the country’s 700-plus secondary schools are set to shut on foot of a stoppage by the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) in protest over two-tier pay rates.Official advice set out in a recent circular to school managers stated that they should “make appropriate arrangements to record the attendance or absence of all staff employed by the school on 4 February. This applies to all teaching and non-teaching staff employed by the school.”In some cases, members of the Association of Secondary Teachers’ Ireland (ASTI) and non-union teachers will have to cross picket lines in order to be paid, regardless of whether the school is open or closed to students.Official adviceIn official advice to members, the ASTI has advised its members that they must be “available for work” in order to be paid.“To refuse to do so would mean that you would be deemed to be engaging in unofficial industrial action and would not be covered by the immunities provided in Industrial Relations Act, 1990,” the advice stated.In addition, the union told its members that the TUI had given assurances that they would have “no difficulty” with ASTI members attending for work and passing their pickets.“This is also in keeping with normal protocolsstandards set out by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ” the ASTI advice states.Latest figures indicate the strike is set to close about 400 of the country’s 700-plus secondary schools. The stoppage is also expected to cause significant disruption to further education centres and institutes of technology.The Department of Education said it was likely that virtually all of the 248 Education and Training Board schools and 96 community and comprehensive schools would be closed.In addition, a minimum of 45 of the country’s 380 voluntary secondary schools will also shut.While this latter category of school is mostly represented by ASTI members, the union has directed its members not to provide cover for striking TUI members.This has forced the closure of some voluntary secondary schools on health and safety grounds, even in cases where a relatively small number of teachers are TUI members.On foot of the strike, many schools have rescheduled the timing of “mock” exams for Junior Cert and Leaving Cert students next week, while some assessments for students sitting the Leaving Cert Applied have also been adjusted.TalksTalks last Friday involving the TUI and the oversight body for the public service agreement on the planned strike without any breakthrough. However, it seems increasingly unlikely that financial penalties will be applied to the 19,000 teachers in schools, institutes of technology and centres of further education who take part in the strike on Tuesday. In a statement on Friday, the oversight body – which is made up of representatives of public service management and unions and chaired by the Workplace Relations Commission – said it regretted that the proposed strike would go ahead .“The oversight body will meet in the near future to consider the issues raised by the parties in connection with this matter,” it said.The Government has powers under financial emergency legislation to impose financial sanctions on members of trade unions considered to have “repudiated” the public service agreement.However, a spokeswoman for Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said it was “not constructive” to talk about financial penalties being applied to those teachers taking part in the planned strike."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159568.1580675976!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus test results due on suspected case from moscow dublin flight","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A flight attendant of Cambodian Lanmei Airlines demonstrates safety procedures in the airplane while wearing a face mask during a flight from Cambodia to Guangzhou, China. Photograph: Alex PlavevskiEPATest results on a passenger who arrived at Dublin Airport and was suspected of having the new coronavirus are expected as early as today, as the outbreak claimed its first victim outside China.With the death of a 44-year-old Chinese inidual in the Philippines, the death toll from the virus has reached 305, with 14,564 cases now confirmed, health authorities said on Sunday.The head of the World Health Organisation’s emergency team, Dr Mike Ryan said he has “every confidence” public health authorities in Ireland are making the right preparations for the virus.“We handled Sars quite well and sensitively,” the Geneva-based Sligoman told The . “A key thing is for doctors and emergency departments to be in a position to be alert for, and to detect, cases.”With China’s stock markets preparing to re-open on Monday after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, there is growing nervousness about the impact of the crisis on the country’s economy.Suspected caseThe passenger in Ireland’s first-known suspected case arrived on a flight from Moscow and was removed by ambulance.Other passengers were told in leaflets they had been “on a flight with a possible case of novel coronavirus” and were advised to “avoid contact with other people as much as possible tonight”.They were due to be contacted by a public health doctor on Sunday.They were also told to stay at home or in their hotel room if they became ill, “especially with cough, sore throat, breathlessness or high temperature”, and to phone a doctor or 999, mentioning that they had been on the flight.Ireland won’t have testing facilities for the new virus until next week, so the passenger’s sample has to be sent to the UK, where the turnaround is up to 48 hours.Under existing procedures, airline pilots are required to radio ahead to ground staff where a medical emergency arises involving a passenger, so that the person can receive immediate medical attention on landing.The Department of Health and the HSE declined to provide any information about the incident and the department said that as part of the response to the virus, it will not be providing information about the activation of protocols “other than confirmed cases”.ProfilingSpeaking on Saturday, Dr Ryan warned against profiling specific groups when checking for cases.“I’m conscious that we over-associate this disease with China. This is the country where it emerged, true, but it could have emerged anywhere.”The swine flu epidemic started in Mexico, and Ebola in the Congo, he points out.“China needs our solidarity right now, and recognition of what they’ve done to fight this. We need to work closely with them.”“This is a time for facts, not fear. A time for solidarity, not stigma.”He also pointed out: “There’s a much higher chance in Ireland of getting flu and, if you’re not vaccinated against flu, that translates into a bigger risk of getting sick and dying.”While some countries are operating temperature tests on passengers arriving at airports, Ryan says the WHO does not support entry screening, and considers exit screening more effective.“If it is used as part of a broader set of measures, that’s fine, but entry screening alone is certainly not enough. You can’t just put up a few thermal cameras. The real point of entry for cases is probably in the GP surgery or the emergency department, when someone shows up.”Hand hygiene is more useful in preventing the spread of the virus than wearing face masks, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Rooms to be adapted for people with range of disabilities and medical conditionsRise in burglary, assault and public order crimes as Garda return \u0026euro2m to exchequerHundreds of secondary schools set to shut on Tuesday in strike over two-tier payNon-EEA workers needed to plug labour gaps as European economies improve, firms sayFor 32,000 new Irish citizens, this is the first general election they are eligible to vote inUCD student union president, originally from Poland, unable to vote in electionFF reacts to Leo Varadkar\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquobackwoodsmen\u0026rsquo comment as campaign enters final weekCandidates Kamal Uddin and Oghenetano John Uwhumiakpor on running for the D\u0026aacuteilMaria Waters falls outside State policy of providing drug for cervical cancer sufferersClothes, handbags, cars and houses among items seized by Criminal Assets BureauInaccessibility is limiting how many lakes can be tested, as required by EU water directiveRevenue says smugglers using \u0026lsquoinventive and complex methods\u0026rsquo to bring in cigarettesMartin Doyle remembered as \u0026lsquoa soldier to his core\u0026rsquo in his hometown of New RossPricewatch: Luggage remained undelivered long after passengers arrived home from USReader\u0026rsquos attempt to upgrade internet speed has become a complicated back-and-forthHead of WHO emergency team has \u0026lsquoevery confidence\u0026rsquo in Irish response preparationsCampaigners say more slips and falls by cyclists due to dirt and oil from construction vehiclesDr Richard Clarke served as a bishop in the Church of Ireland for 23 yearsAuthorities in \u0026lsquoarms race with bugs\u0026rsquo because of pressure on ecosystem, Mike Ryan says"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159409.1580664267!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il td rejects party leader s criticism of sinn f%C3%A9in","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil TD John McGuinness pictured canvasing on Connolly Street in Kilkenny on Friday with local residents Lisa Marie Meany and Shane Kelly. Photograph: Dylan VaughanThe former Public Accounts Committee chairman said he hoped the government formed after Saturday’s vote would be a centre-left one aimed at delivering “an agenda of social change”, focusing on health, the elderly and housing. However, he described recent comments from Mr Martin, that Sinn Féin were controlled by “shadowy figures” within its ard chomairle, as “strange”, and argued the decision-making process was similar for Fianna Fáil.  His party’s grassroots felt “excluded” and were less inclined to get involved at ard fheis, he said. Speaking while canvassing in his constituency, Mr McGuinness said Mr Martin was also wrong to rule out talks with Sinn Féin when forming the next government. “I firmly believe that we should be talking to everybody - and that includes Sinn Féin. Whatever the coalition is going to be it’s not going to be a coalition that will reflect the policies of any one political party.”He said Mr Martin was concerned with the “history of Sinn Féin” but “I look from the present to the future - I don’t look backwards”.Speaking in Cork at the weekend, Mr Martin said the latest opinion polls confirmed there was a major desire for change in the country but he insisted Fianna Fáil was best placed to deliver that change.“Repealing the Eighth Amendment would not have happened without Fianna Fáil, with Billy Kelleher and Lisa Chambers and Ned O’Sullivan at the Joint Oireachtas Committee looking at the issue,” Mr Martin said.“And this is what really annoys me to some extent because Sinn Féin couldn’t even vote for it at committee. All they could do was abstain and they were supposed to have an ard fheis on it and they didn’t.”Mr Martin, who personally backed Repealing the Eighth Amendment when many of his parliamentary party expressed their opposition to such a move, was also keen to point out that Fianna Fáil supported marriage equality.“We were the second party to call for marriage equality, Labour were the first out of traps, to be fair but we endorsed it as at an ard fheis, we brought in its predecessor, civil union and Fianna Fáil decriminalised homosexuality.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159242.1580667272!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"passenger on moscow dublin flight is tested for coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe flight landed at Dublin Airport shortly after 9pm on Saturday.

In a statement on Sunday evening, the Department of Health said it wouldn’t comment or confirm suspected cases or whether response plans to suspected cases had been activated. However, “to date, there are no confirmed cases of Coronavirus in Ireland”, it said.Leaflets were distributed to passengers on the flight by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HSPC) advising them that they had “been on a flight with a possible case of novel coronavirus”. Images of the leaflet, circulating on social media, show that passengers were told to “please avoid contact with other people as much as possible tonight”. The leaflet, which is dated February 1st, advises passengers to stay at home or in their hotel room if they became ill, “especially with cough, sore throat, breathlessness of high temperature”, and to phone a doctor or 999, mentioning that they had been on the flight.“A public health doctor will contact you tomorrow”.Spokeswomen for the HSE and the Department of Health would not confirm any details relating to the incident. The Department said that “Ireland has advanced plans in place as part of its comprehensive preparedness to deal with public health emergencies such as novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV). “The aim of these plans in Ireland at this point in the response to novel Coronavirus is one of containment. This seeks to maximise the chance of a case being detected should one arise here and to prevent it being transmitted to another person.”“The activation of protocols that achieve this is a core and expected feature of our preparedness and ongoing response. The protocol always ensures that the people involved are fully communicated with and are aware of what is going on. Their activation is an indication of the quality and responsiveness of the agencies and the staff who carry them out in the health services, the emergency service and at the ports of entry into Ireland.”The Department said that no information will be provided about “inidual activations of these plans or about inidual cases of novel Coronoavirus other than confirmed cases”.

File photograph: Yasser Al-ZayyatAFPGetty ImagesIllegal tobacco seizures collapsed by more than three-quarters in 2019 as smugglers copied sophisticated techniques from the drugs trade in an effort to avoid detection, new figures show.Just €10.5 million in cigarettes and other tobacco products were seized by Revenue last year, compared to some €42.2 million in 2018.While the 2018 figures were unusually high due to the discovery of Ireland’s first counterfeit cigarette factory in March, the 2019 figure is still less than half the value of tobacco products seized during 2017 and 2016. The 2019 figure is contained in “headline” results for last year, published by Revenue in January. A spokesman for the tax authority said smugglers are using “increasingly inventive and complex smuggling methods and concealment techniques”.Revenue said it had noted a “shift away from the large-scale smuggling of tobacco products in shipping containers to smaller amounts of tobacco products being smuggled in sophisticated concealments traditionally associated with drug smuggling”. A shipping container can hold between seven and eight million cigarettes, Revenue said. “Having regard to the fact that smaller amounts of tobacco products are being smuggled, this shift invariably resulted in a reduction in the number of cigarettes and tobacco produces seized as a result of detections at ports.”The shift away from large-scale consignments has been evidenced by increasingly ingenious methods of concealment. For example, customs agents made two seizures during 2019 where cigarettes were concealed in hollowed out wooden planks.A Revenue spokesman said it is “alert to the resourcefulness of those involved in criminality in the supply of illicit tobacco products and responded effectively to this change in concealment methods”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159503.1580670195!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"victoria cross winner turned ira man honoured a century on","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAt a re-enactment to commemorate Martin Doyle were Brendan O’Neill and John Greer. Photograph: Mary BrowneIn March 1919 Martin Doyle returned to his native New Ross a war hero. He won the Victoria Cross in September 1918 for an incredible feat of gallantry in which he rushed a German trench and rescued a badly wounded British tank sergeant.As he alighted from the train at New Ross, the townspeople escorted him to his home on Mary Street Upper and a trumpeter played a bugle call as he passed the Royal Hotel. He then attended a civic reception outside the main square in the town.More than a century later the townspeople again turned out to remember Doyle, this time not only as a British army war hero but as a man who had fought for Irish freedom in the IRA and then joined the National Army during the Civil War, in which he was wounded.Outside the town hall in New Ross, a marble paving stone paid for by the British government in honour of Doyle was unveiled by Cllr John Fleming, the chairman of New Ross Municipal District.The flagstone of the town hall remembers the “glorious” Battle of the Boyne. It sits next to a plaque remembering Michael O’Hanrahan, who was executed for his role in the Easter Rising, and opposite a statue to the men from the town who fought in the 1798 rebellion.Doyle embodied a lot of these contrasting allegiances. He left the British army in June 1919. In October 1920 he joined the IRA in East Clare and the Irish Army on its foundation.The date chosen for the event, February 2nd, was not a coincidence, said Cllr Michael Sheehan, chairman of Wexford County Council. It marked the anniversary of the founding of the State’s Army.Town paradeHaving fought for the British army, Doyle embraced Irish republicanism and represented “the very best of who we are and the very best of who we can be as republicans”, he told the assembled crowd.The event began with a parade through the town. Re-enactors wearing the first World War khaki of the British army mixed with those wearing the overcoats, bandoliers and peaked caps of the old IRA.Irish army veterans and those from the Royal British Legion laid poppy wreaths and tricolour wreaths beside the paving stone. The British government was represented by the defence attaché Col Darren Doherty and by Sarah Tiffin, the deputy head of mission at the British embassy in Dublin.It was a special occasion for members of the Doyle family. Two of his three daughters are still alive and in their 90s, though Doyle died in 1940 when he was just 46. Monica Condon, Doyle’s niece, laid a wreath on behalf of her mother, Lil Doyle.At least 50 members of the family were in attendance, including David Cooney, a grandnephew of Doyle and a former Irish ambassador to Britain.“He was a soldier to his core and he served with great distinction. He reflected his time. More Irish men served in the British army than fought in the War of Independence,” he said.“Martin Doyle reflected the changes that happened at the time as the mood of the people changed. He tells the story of what happened in Ireland 100 years ago.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159309.1580657195!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 as a minority in a country you need to participate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Labour Party general election candidate Kamal Uddin with the trees he gives to people while canvassing in Castlebar, Co Mayo.

Four years later the Bangladeshi-born business owner is back on the Mayo ticket as a Labour candidate.Canvassing for a second general election is much easier than the first time, says Mr Uddin, who has lived in Ireland for more than two decades and runs a petrol station in Castlebar.“I’m going back to the same people and they accept me. They see that I’m a hard worker and believe in my desire for change.”Mr Uddin says he joined the Labour party last year because of their focus on “building equality in society”. A small number of people have reacted badly when he knocks on their doors but the majority are accepting of a political candidate from a different background.“There were maybe one or two negatives when they see you’re from a different background with a different skin colour. But 99 per cent of Mayo people are very accepting and there’s no racism towards me. Mayo is going to show in this election that there’s no room for racism, it doesn’t matter what colour you are.”Instead of handing out leaflets outlining his policy commitments, Mr Uddin has been distributing birch saplings, which he encourages constituents to plant in their gardens. “We have to think about the next generation environmentally. I have a plan to plant 5,000 trees. I’ve started this in Mayo but I hope all politicians can follow and then the whole country will be green.”‘Politics has to do with everyone’s future’On the other side of the country, in the Dublin Fingal Constituency, Oghenetano John Uwhumiakpor is canvassing in his hometown of Balbriggan as a People Before Profit candidate. He ran unsuccessfully in the 2019 local elections but is optimistic about Saturday’s vote.While Mr Uwhumiakpor says most people have responded positively to his campaign, he was dismayed by a recent Facebook post which poked fun at his surname as “another wifi password looking for votes up in Balbriggan”.Asked if he considered the statement racist, Mr Uwhumiakpor says on reflection he believes it was just meant as a joke and is trying not to take the comment personally.“I was taken aback. I’ve lived here for almost 14 years so I think I understand the Irish sense of humour. But sometimes people misuse humour. There are lots of Irish names that are difficult to pronounce but they are unique and they have their own importance.“But my name shouldn’t be the main issue, there are lots of problems in the country that we should be focussing on rather than dwelling on my name.”Mr Uwhumiakpor believes most constituents around Balbriggan are looking for a change in government and has witnessed real anger around the cost of renting and childcare.He has also encountered new Irish citizens who choose not to vote because they became disillusioned by the corrupt politics in their home countries.“I try to explain that this is a different society, it’s more transparent. I hope as time goes on they’ll understand that politics has to do with everyone’s future. If we have good leaders today then we have a future tomorrow.

File photograph: Bryan O’BrienOn February 8th, Karolina Ó Beacháin will cast a vote for the first time in an Irish general election. Originally from Poland, Ms Ó Beacháin became an Irish citizen four years ago specifically because she wanted to vote.“I couldn’t imagine not voting here, it’s my country now. I’m Polish by birth but Irish by choice. I was voting in the locals before, but the fact that I couldn’t vote in the generals wasn’t natural. How could I have an influence?”Ms Ó Beacháin is one of the 5,072 Poles to have become Irish citizens in the past four years. Since 2016, 32,247 people from around the globe have become citizens of this country. They are all eligible to vote, yet have they taken the time to register? How interested are our new citizens in Irish politics?Like all Irish, new citizens who were not included in the 2019-2020 electoral register can only vote on Saturday if they added their name to the supplementary register by the January 22nd deadline.While many new Irish citizens are Polish, data released by the Department of Justice shows 2,891 Romanians, 2,837 Indians, 2,067 Nigerians, 1,974 people from the UK and 1,604 Filipinos secured citizenship between 2016 and 2019.More than 1,200 Latvians and Pakistanis have also become Irish citizens since 2016 followed by around 900 Brazilians and Chinese.Nearly half of adults who obtained Irish citizenship in 2019 – some 2,627 people – lived in Dublin city and county, according to Department of Justice statistics.An additional 1,342 new citizens were based in Leinster 1,125 were living in Munster 407 were living in Connacht and 193 lived in Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.RootsDr Adrian Kavanagh from Maynooth University says regardless of whether a person has secured citizenship, people only tend to vote when they have set down roots.“The longer you’ve lived in an area the more you know the local issues. If you’ve spent 70 years in west Offaly you’re very clear on the candidates and their backgrounds. But if you’re new to an area you’re not tapped into that.”The “cost of voting” theory – meaning a person’s access to information around an election – also plays a strong role in whether they participate.“Affluent areas are more tied in with better education and find it easier to get information on voting. People in less affluent areas find it difficult to get this information. The same applies to younger people, and new citizens would also fall into this category.”Prof Mary Gilmartin, who specialises in migration and mobility at Maynooth University, is more positive about new Irish citizens’ electoral participation, particularly among Poles. “EU citizens have pretty similar rights so not being able to vote in elections is something that would motivate many to seek Irish citizenship.”While EU citizens are entitled to vote in local elections, Prof Gilmartin believes many are actually reluctant to get involved until they have Irish citizenship.“They feel as if they aren’t really entitled to vote. There’s also limited power at the local level so not having a vote in the Dáil elections is quite exclusionary for people.”However, confusion around how to register and where the local polling station is located can act as a barrier to many, she says, adding that the decision to hold the 2020 general election at such short notice, and before the new electoral register came into effect, will have excluded many new Irish citizens from voting.“We also know migrants are significantly more likely to be living in rental accommodation. Our system is predicated on the idea that people live at the same address and don’t move. It hasn’t kept up with the reality of contemporary Ireland.”‘It’s the same crisis’Chairman of Forum Polonia Barnaba Dorda has noticed far more political participation among Ireland’s Polish community in this election than ever before. “Poles are settled here now so national politics is more appealing to them. They want to have a say in what’s going on at the national level.”The housing crisis, the cost of childcare and access to healthcare are issues that affect the Irish-Polish community as well, says Mr Dorda. “It’s the same crisis for Poles in Ireland as it is for the Irish.”Following the announcement of the 2020 general election, Forum Polonia launched a campaign urging Poles with Irish citizenship to register to vote. “We’re trying to encourage people to think about what is important for their lives here and to talk to politicians about their concerns,” says Mr Dorda.Ms Ó Beacháin, who is a Green Party campaign manager in Dublin north west, does not believe many new citizens will take part in this election. Unless political parties actually target these communities and factor their needs into policy commitments, new Irish citizens are unlikely to take an interest in national politics, she says.“Parties don’t really address the problems of the new Irish, they don’t recognise the different challenges we face like bilingual education for our children. But there’s a lack of targeting, even in terms of their messaging.”While the 2019 local elections saw a small number of candidates from migrant backgrounds secure seats, Ms Ó Beacháin believes it’s almost impossible for similar candidates to secure a win in the general elections. “They will have to break through another glass ceiling. In order to be selected you have to work at it for many years breaking that circle takes so long. Even if someone works very hard you still need the local connections like ‘I knew your father or your grandfather’.”The election of just two candidates from migrant backgrounds to Dáil Éireann would create representation at Government level that new Irish citizens can relate to, says Ms Ó Beacháin. “The new Irish have different political views there should be a place for them in every party.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020matt cartoon february 1","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Duchess of Cambridge urges children to be \u0026#39courageous\u0026#39 and share their worries in mental health week messagePolice investigating Barrymore swimming pool death urge witnesses whose loyalties may have \u0026#39changed\u0026#39 to come forwardFlorence Nightingale exhibition to shine light on her as an older woman, as curator says \u0026#39lady with the lamp\u0026#39 was not her \u0026#39peak\u0026#39There quarters of parents say Facebook is \u0026#39not safe for children\u0026#39, NSPCC poll findsWinter is being \u0026#39lost\u0026#39 as a season, leading to butterflies, newts and birds arriving months early, warns The Woodland TrustChaucer\u0026#39s Canterbury Tales becomes first text to be turned into an app, in Terry Jones\u0026#39 final projectComment: Project Fear is still haunting the national debate on a clean break from EU regulationsDuke of Cambridge hits out at Bafta\u0026#39s lack of ersityBritain will not accept EU rules to get a trade deal, says Boris JohnsonCoronavirus: Incredible timelapse shows hospital go up in daysStreatham attack shows weakness of Boris Johnson\u0026#39s crackdown on terror sentencingSudesh Amman: how a 17 year old student became a terrorist shot by police on a south London high streetStreatham attack knifeman named as Sudesh Amman who had a previous terror convictionJudges to sit for thousands of extra days in bid to reduce court delays, Lord Chancellor announcesCrime gangs use cash-only auctions to fuel surging car thefts, as police chief urges banA freed terrorist strikes again: two stabbed in Streatham attackSNP must stop acting like \u0026#39Brussels fifth column\u0026#39 after Nicola Sturgeon referendum \u0026#39capitulation\u0026#39, says former deputy leaderHow the Streatham attack unfolded: \u0026#39The lady was just walking down the street - he stabbed her in the back\u0026#39Water cannon should be used against Extinction Rebellion protesters, says majority of publicSpeedy police response to Streatham attack indicates suspect was under surveillance Comment: To really understand Leavers, you have to grasp the meaning of homeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"actress claims slept mick jagger 15","story":"Sir Mick Jagger\u0027s relationships have been well documented over the past six decades.Married and orced once, he has been romantically involved with many other women including Jerry Hall, Marianne Faithfull and Marsha Hunt.However, details of one encounter, an alleged two-day fling in 1977 with a 15-year-old aspiring actress, have just emerged.More than four decades after the encounter Rae Dawn, the daughter of Tommy Chong, a comedian, has broken her silence – albeit accidentally.Ms Dawn, a three times-orced 58-year-old grandmother, inadvertently told of the alleged relationship in a taped interview with The Hollywood Reporter.Her indiscretion came after she was asked how she landed a role in the 1985 film, Commando, her best-known role.\u0027I got it because I\u0027d been in a Jagger video and then they asked me how I knew Mick and before I knew it I\u0027d blurted out that I\u0027d had sex with him when I was 15. It just slipped out, she told the Mail on Sunday.I feel incredibly bad about it. It\u0027s me and my big mouth. My family and friends knew about it but it\u0027s not something I have ever dined out on.Ms Dawn stressed the relationship was consensual and that the Rolling Stone did not know how old she was.She introduced herself to the rock star, who was 33-years old and married to Bianca at the time, while visiting a friend – the daughter of John Phillips, the lead singer of the Mamas and the Papas.He never asked me how old I was and I never told him, she said.It never came up. I remember thinking he was really cute. He had tousled hair. I thought, \u0027Oh man, he is beautiful.\u0027He said, \u0027What are you doing right now?\u0027 I said, \u0027Nothing really.\u0027He grabbed my hand and we jumped in his limo and went straight to a recording studio. The Stones were there, I was in the background. I remember being in there for hours and hours.Then I slept over at his apartment. I knew what I was doing. I was experimenting with Mick. I was having fun.The following day, Ms Dawn recalled, the couple went to the group\u0027s recording studio, before going to see a Fleetwood Mac concert at Madison Square Garden in New York, where they were mobbed by fans.Sir Mick was a great kisser, she recalled.He wasn\u0027t that much older than me in my brain. He was 33 and young and gorgeous with a nice body. It wasn\u0027t a bad thing, it was fabulous. Totally rock \u0027n\u0027 roll. He didn\u0027t make me do anything I didn\u0027t want to do, but he was very vain, always looking in the mirror.Now 43-years on, she regrets disclosing details of the fling.I feel incredibly bad about it. It\u0027s me and my big mouth. My family and friends knew about it but it\u0027s not something I have ever dined out on, she added.He did nothing wrong. He didn\u0027t make me do anything I didn\u0027t want to do.It was the 1970s, a different era. I wasn\u0027t a victim.I don\u0027t want him to get into trouble about this. It wasn\u0027t traumatising. I knew what I was doing. I wasn\u0027t an innocent schoolgirl. I always acted a lot older than I was. I was a grown-up at 15.Sir Mick was approached by the Mail on Sunday but has not commented on the story. The  has also approached his representatives.The age of consent at the time was 17, but is understood that Sir Mick is unlikely to face prosecution given that the alleged encounter took place more than 20 years ago and his beyond the statute of limitations for reporting such cases.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands sign petition briton keep job french council","story":"More than 34,000 people have signed an online petition in support of a British expatriate denied French citizenship on the grounds that his income is insufficient.Mark Lawrence, a 48-year-old carpenter, has been living in France for 27 years.But the French authorities said he did not have “sufficient and stable resources” and could become a burden on the state.The father of four, who supports his children and his French partner, will be able to stay as a resident and does not risk deportation.But he will have to give up his seat on the local council of Plazac, a village of about 700 people in the south-western Dordogne region, nicknamed “Dordogneshire” because of its large British community.In the picturesque nearby town of Eymet, Britons make up 17 per cent of the population and the community has experienced a Brexit boost with a recent influx of Britons seeking a home in the EU.Many long-term expatriates are angry at losing the vote in French local elections, although French and other EU residents in Britain will retain the right to vote in local elections in the UK.Mr Lawrence is hoping the petition urging the authorities to reconsider their “cruel and absurd” decision will improve his prospects of obtaining French nationality. He was 21 when he settled in France and speaks fluent French. “My home is here,” he said. “In my head, I was French. Now it’s as if I’ve lost my place. I’m neither English, nor French.” At his local café, everyone seems to know him. He says he was conceived in the Dordogne after his parents bought a small farm in a quiet, wooded valley 50 years ago.“I’m made in France,” he joked, saying that as a child he holidayed in France with his parents two or three times a year and it felt natural to make his home in their farmhouse, surrounded by walnut trees. He passed language and culture tests required for citizenship, but his application was rejected in April, and again on appeal in October.

I mean, very basic. I’ve driven a fair few in my time – and this year will be sampling many more. This is a bit of what I’ve learned, imperfectly, thus far.\u0026nbspIt is not, for these purposes, a “hybrid”, like the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbspor any other vehicle that also has an internal combustion engine on board (with one of two very particular exceptions).\u0026nbspAn electric car is a pure thing – it runs completely and solely on its batteries. When they run out, you stop moving.\u0026nbspI like to think of it as a cross between a washing machine, a laptop and,\u0026nbsperm, a car. So, your car is driven entirely by electric power – powerful lithium-ion batteries (like in your laptop) sending electricity to an electric motor (like your washing machine) which drives the road wheels (like on your motor car).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, London210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, LondonThe electricity stored in the batteries mostly comes from being plugged into the mains (there are various charging options, most commonly a fast charger attached to the side of your home, if you have the space). Some will be regenerated from the car itself, saving power otherwise wasted when braking, for example.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp2 Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?Yes, but they are not much more than prototypes, with only a handful of filling stations currently. Critics say using a hydrogen fuel cell to generate the electricity for the batteries simply adds an additional stage of energy accumulation and the manufacture of the hydrogen could be problematic, if it requires a disproportionate amount of non-renewable electricity.\u0026nbsp3 How far will one go on a charge?Well, that depends, but you can count on a modern mainstream electric car these days to bae able to take you 200 to 250 miles (conservatively) on a single charge – a\u0026nbspKia\u0026nbspe-Niro, say, or Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric. In the right hands, 300 miles might be possible. This, by the way is two or three times the usual range you’d experience a few years ago.\u0026nbspFeeling the spark: Drivers learning to love electric carsThe most advanced models, such as the famous Tesla range, will go on and on for near enough 400 miles. Some of the smaller more urban-oriented models, such as the new electric Smart cars will be good for about 100 miles.\u0026nbspThe rest is down to how you drive and when. Winter means the batteries tend to run down faster and you’ll likely get a shorter range.\u0026nbspIf you drive hard and fast you’ll use up more energy than otherwise, just like in a petrol or diesel car. Over along time the ability of the batteries to take and store a charge will deteriorate (just like your smartphone or laptop).Yes. To buy or lease you’re looking at a premium of some thousands of pounds. So, let’s take an example, the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona, a compact\u0026nbspSUV.\u0026nbsp With a conventional petrol engine you can pick one up at a list price of £17,505. For the hybrid version (petrol plus electric power generated on-board) you’ll need to fork out £22,495. For the\u0026nbspBEV\u0026nbspHyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric, the price jumps to £35,100, or £32,600 when you take into account the government grant for electric cars of up to £3,500. \u0026nbspAgainst the usually higher purchase price or monthly PCP or lease fee you need to balance the savings you make compared t petrol or diesel: far cheaper fuel spending on your electricity tariff) lower running costs (fewer moving mechanical parts and consumables eg exhaust pipe, alternator, engine) and a range of lower taxes and congest and parking charges. Electric cars are exempt from road tax, carry lower benefit-in-kind tax liabilities for commercial users, usually form congestion charges and city bans, and can enjoy cheaper parking. There’s also a government subsidy of up to £500 for a home charger.\u0026nbspWhy have electric cars failed to spark with consumers? Has Tesla hastened the death of Britain’s electric car revolution?Grant Shapps’ plan for electric cars will make China a motoring giantWhether this makes financial sense really depends your pattern of car usage – the number of miles you do a year, and the type of journeys. With a lot of medium range commuting for example (say 60 miles a day) an electric car could pay for itself within a few years for sustained long-distance travelling then a diesel might make more sense.5 What are the advantages of an electric car?Apart from the financial ones it is of course far better for the environment. There are many debates about, say, the cost (in environmental terms) of mining rare minerals for the batteries, or transporting them vast distances to factories, or the energy used in making them. Also obviously an electric car that runs on electricity generated from soar power is better than one where the electricity happens to be generated by burning coal (ins or far as anyone can know this when they plug in).\u0026nbspHowever a reasonable assumption is that all electric cars are greener than any internal combustion engined equivalent, and that any public transport (rail or bus) is usually greener than any private alternative.Don’t forget that electric cars are very refined – being almost silent at any speed, and the acceleration form rest is startlingly fast, though they tend to run out of puff as they approach their top speeds. In other words they can be good to drive and to be driven in.6 What are the disadvantages?Surprisingly few, though it does depend on your circumstances. If you live in a flat or a terraced house, charging from home is obviously impossible or difficult, and the ease of use of an electric vehicle is much reduced. If you imagine that you’ll have to do journeys of more than 400 miles without warning, then an internal combustion engine is a surer way of getting wherever it is you might conceivably wish to go – though you’d need to take a break anyway.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to add that some of the public charging infrastructure leaves a bit to be desired – it could usefully be much bigger, more reliable and easier to use.And of course you do need to balance the financial sums against the clear practical and environmental plusses of being a green driver.\u0026nbsp7 Don’t they take ages to charge?Yes and no. The Tesla is an exception, in many ways, because it has a dedicated network of ultra-fast chargers, as well as being chargeable at home.\u0026nbspMost owners of electric cars have to rely on charging at home – but don’t\u0026nbsp have much trouble charging because they most likely have a home charging point, which does mean off-street parking for the moment. If you take a mainstream option like the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectricity home, using a regular\u0026nbsp7kW\u0026nbspcharging point via its own cable a near-full zero to 80 per cent charge takes around 9 hours.A similar charge with a rapid charger (such as you’d fine at, say, motorway services)\u0026nbsptakes around an hour and a quarter. 75 minutes.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, you can also use a domestic three-pin charging lead, plugged into the mains at home like you’d plug in a kettle. However you’d looking at about 24 hours for a full charge – because the batteries are so big and the trickle form the domestic system so modest.\u0026nbsp8 Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?Yes. Much of the progress in the usefulness of the electric car is coming from improvements in battery “density” – the amount of useful power that can be stored in a an ever-more compact way.The battery pack is usually stored lower in the car, under the floor or the seats, and this can help with keeping the car stable (lower centre of gravity). Given that these units can grow very hot and need ventilation or water cooling for example, and have to be protected from water ingress (if fording a stream say, or just in a heavy downpour) , the progress in engineering in this field is truly impressive.\u0026nbspHowever, eventually the rate of improvement in range and efficiency will slow, and that might well mark an optimal moment to make a purchase or take on an electric car lease. But we cannot know when this will happen.9 What about hybrids?Well, what about hybrids? They are not electric cars. This is because they are, as the name implies, hybrids – a cross between an electric car and a traditional one powered by a petrol or diesel engine. Thus well-known hybrid models such as the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbsphave an internal combustion engine on board, as well as an electric motor and some batteries to boost performance and economy.\u0026nbspIn a hybrid the electric power is “self-generated”, which is to say that it comes from the engine regenerating and recycling power that might otherwise be wasted. So for example some of the power usually lost in heavy braking is instead sent back via the electric motor working “backwards” to the batteries, where it is stored for later use.\u0026nbspI drove 300 miles in an electric car and here’s what happenedMost hybrids pair an electric and a petrol engine because the two units tend to complement each other in use diesel-electric hybrids are rarer. “Mild” hybrids are just that – they have only a small ethic motor and minimal battery storage just to give a slight edge to reduce emissions and improve economy. The green advantage is quite marginal.\u0026nbspPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have the additional option of charging from the mains, as with an electric car, but it is not necessary to do so.\u0026nbspThe drawback with the hybrid technology is the constant trade-offs that have to made between the energy saved through the battery-electric motor system, set against the additional weight of them, which of course tends to raise fuel consumption. Clever software can minimise these trade-offs to more acceptable levels, but they will always be there, as compared to a\u0026nbspBEV. Hybrids, indeed, in their complexity and weight, can represent the e worst of both worlds.\u0026nbsp10 Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?They have been, yes, but the next few months year will see the launch of some very well-known models with full-electric versions.\u0026nbsp These will include: the Vauxhall\u0026nbspCorsa-e Peugeot 208 electric Volvo\u0026nbspXC40\u0026nbspRecharge and the Mini electric. They join an already quiet impressive variety of electric cars on sale or soon to go on sale.From the tiny\u0026nbspSkoda\u0026nbspCiti GOe-iV\u0026nbspand Smart EQ through the Renault Zoe to the Nissan leaf to MG ZS and the Jaguar\u0026nbspiPace\u0026nbspthere are already options to match your tastes and budget. And there is also a small market in used models such as the Renault\u0026nbspFluence, Mitsubishi\u0026nbspIMEV, Vauxhall\u0026nbspAmpera\u0026nbspor first generation Nissan Leaf that might also suit.These cars will tend to have shorter ranges, though, while older Renaults may still have their batteries on monthly lease from the company. As always – do your own research, but you can approach an electric car with more positivity than ever before.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Or any other fast fashion brand that will pay them oodles of money to wear their clothes and sit in on a design meeting or two.\u0026nbspSince the ITV2 programme started in its current iteration, its contestants have gone on to land six-figure deals with fast fashion labels.

The men fared well\u0026nbsptoo\u0026nbsp– Ovie Soko got a deal with ASOS while Tommy Fury was snapped up by Boohoo Man.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Norton continued by describing Joker as “the story of a white man who makes himself even whiter”.Created with Sketch.19 films to look out for in 2020 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey.

(Adam White)Laura Dern and Renée Zellweger won Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress respectively, while Brad Pitt won Best Supporting Actor for his role in Once Upon a Time\u0026nbspin Hollywood.Pitt was unable to attend the ceremony due to “family obligations”, but co-star Margot Robbie read out a pre-written speech – with a few friendly jabs at the UK included. “Hey, Britain,” the speech began. “I heard you just became single – welcome to the club.Surprisingly, Pitt’s joke was one of very few mentions of Brexit during the ceremony, with the Bafta membership seemingly choosing this moment in history to turn inwards and examine their own flaws\u0026nbspas opposed to looking outwards.\u0026nbspThe awards could mark an end to Parasite’s chances of winning the Academy Award for Best Film. Director Bong Joon-ho picked up two awards: for Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Original Screenplay.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold after signals of a pick-up. The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up. The capital will be reallocated between the other EU central banks.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop.

The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in.

Last year, the company unveiled the Switch\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspas well as quietly bumping up the battery life of the larger version of the console. Those were made possible as a consequence of updated Nvidia chips on the inside.EA says people prefer not to play its games on the Nintendo SwitchFurukawa suggested that the console is in its midway phase and that it would be looking for further growth opportunities for the new console.“According to the conventional wisdom for dedicated video game platforms, Nintendo Switch should be entering the midway phase of the hardware lifecycle,” he said. “But we believe we have built a foundation on which we can pursue further growth opportunities for Nintendo Switch.”He pointed to the recent announcement of a special Animal Crossing version of the Switch, which will arrive in Japan alongside the game\u0027s release date in March. That suggests that yet more special designs might come to the Switch, even if there is no update to the hardware inside for 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It also confirms a prediction of Einstein\u0027s general theory of relativity.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrame-dragging has been spotted on Earth, where satellites have examined the gravitational field of our planet as it rotates. But the effect is very small, difficult to measure and hard to examine.More massive objects, such as neutron stars or white dwarfs, give scientists the chance to examine the phenomenon at a much grander scale.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The pulsar served as something of a clock: they could watch as the pulses arrived, measuring them very precisely, over a period of twenty years, and watch for changes as they did.Scientists release audio recording of sound of gravitational wavesThey found that the pulses did indeed drift, as predicted by the theory. After discounting other possible causes, they were able to conclude that the drift was caused by the white dwarf causing the phenomenon of frame-dragging.The idea that rotating bodies would be able to drag spacetime\u0026nbsparound with them was first suggested by Austrian\u0026nbspmathematicians Josef\u0026nbspLense\u0026nbspand Hans\u0026nbspThirring, who suggested it three years after Einstein published his\u0026nbspgeneral theory of relativity.Though the effect can be seen at a very minor and subtle level on Earth, using gyroscopes and other technology, it is 100 million times more potent in the case of a rapidly spinning white dwarf.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tonight’s ceremony will see Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform the ceremony.Ahead of the event, here are 10 of the all-time greatest half time shows, ranked in ascending order:Created with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

In the upcoming film, “Northern invaders” threaten the empire, as opposed to the Huns who are clearly named in the 1998 movie.In both cases, though, Mulan goes from being told that she must find a husband in order to bring honour to her family to posing as a man once each family is asked to send one male into battle.Created with Sketch.19 films to look out for in 2020 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star.

This is a vital service needed to secure the future of thousands of people who have made the UK their home but because of their circumstances are unable to complete the application on their own.“Charities providing this service don’t know if the funding is going to continue beyond the end of March and there comes a point at which you have to end staff\u0026nbspcontracts, because it’s a financial risk to continue employing people without dedicated funding.“Even if the Home Office does decide to provide more funding – which we absolutely think it must to avoid creating misery and chaos for vulnerable people – then it means we’ll lose three critical months because we have to carry out recruitment and then provide training so that people are up to speed on the new system.”Bethan\u0026nbspLant, caseworker manager at the charity, said that due to the complexity of many cases, they had to work with them on a long term basis – which was not possible without guaranteed funding.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Caseworkers are working with women who have experienced domestic violence, trying to collect evidence that they have been here for five years when they haven’t got access to a lot of the documents they need and people with mental health issues who don’t have passports, helping them to approach their embassies to obtain the documents they need,” she said.EU nationals who cannot prove ‘settled status’ denied basic rights“It’s very difficult for us to continue working with these people if we don’t know whether our caseworkers will be there in a month’s time to be able to continue that work. It leaves us stuck.”Nicole\u0026nbspMasri, senior legal officer at charity Rights of Women, which runs an advice service funded by the Home Office to help domestic abuse victims apply to the EU settlement scheme, echoed these concerns, saying any break in continuity of the service would be a “real setback”.“The government can’t afford to lose any time in supporting people to access the scheme before the June 2021 deadline,” she added.Christopher\u0026nbspDesira, solicitor at the law firm\u0026nbspSeraphus\u0026nbspand adviser at the European Commission Representation in the UK, said some charities had been forced to end their support for EU nationals because the uncertainty had left them unable to take on new cases.He said the European Commission had been asking the Home Office whether there would be an extension of funding for the last few months and requesting details, but that it had as yet received no response.Mr\u0026nbspDesira\u0026nbspadded: “I met with the operations team in Liverpool about a month ago, and internally they support the funding being extended, because it makes their job easier. But it’s a ministerial decision.”A Home Office spokesperson confirmed that the\u0026nbspcurrent grant funding scheme was set to finish at the end of March 2020, and said the department was\u0026nbspexploring options for the financial year of 2020-21.They added: “We have already had over 2.5 million people given status under the EU settlement scheme and we are always looking at ways to make sure everyone with the right to status gets it.\u0026nbsp“As well as providing funding for charities which have supported hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people, there are over 1,500 Home Office staff working on the EU Settlement Scheme and 250 Settlement Resolution Centre staff in place to provide assistance to applicants with any questions about the scheme or who need help applying.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I’m not sure European leaders, let alone leaders here in the UK would actually welcome that kind of language.”Renewed calls for Scottish independence follow UK’s departure from EUIn response to accusations there was no plan for Scotland, Mr Raab added: “I don’t think that’s right, we want to make sure, with the levelling-up agenda, with the opportunities of Brexit right across the board, that Scotland’s got the great opportunity to take advantage of all those benefits.“At the same time, we obviously expect the SNP to deliver on its commitment to honour the outcome of the independence referendum and not keep coming back and asking for a second one.“But a lot of this is a distraction from the standards in schools, the high level of taxes, that actually the job of the Scottish government in discharging its responsibility to the Scottish people ought to be focused on.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Expect independence to surgeThousands march to demand Scottish independenceOn Friday, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, who has been demanding Boris Johnson grant the Scottish government the powers to hold a second independence referendum, said Brexit was a “profound moment of sadness” for many who did not vote to Leave in Scotland.The comments from Mr Tusk come after a YouGov poll which showed 51 per cent support for independence – a majority for the first time in five years.However, a majority of Scots surveyed also said they would not like to see another vote on the issue in 2020 or 2021, but most said they would like to see another referendum within the next five years.Also speaking on the issue, Labour’s shadow chancellor,\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell, told the BBC: “I desperately don’t want them to, I want a United Kingdom. I will always argue for that UK and I’m hoping they don’t go along that path.“But I just say to Boris Johnson and his colleagues, do not do things that will threaten the unity of our country – and the language that we’ve heard even in the last 24 hours is isive, rather than holding the country together.“And if he can’t secure a good deal, it will again encourage others therefore in Scotland to go their own way and I think it would be completely counterproductive for the Scottish people.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

Therefore, the partners made the difficult decision to not to move forward with releasing the Iowa Poll.”David Chalian, CNN’s political director, said CNN and the Register had decided to not release the poll “out of an abundance of caution”.The television network had planned an hour-long special based around the results of the poll.Could this be Bernie Sanders’ year?Lis Smith, a senior advisor on communications for Mr Buttigieg, confirmed that the Indiana mayor’s campaign had raised concerns about the accuracy of the results.“Our campaign received a report from a recipient of the Iowa Poll call, raising concerns that not every candidate was named by the interviewer when asked who they support,” Ms Smith said.“We shared this with the organisations behind the poll, who conducted an internal investigation and determined not to release it. We applaud CNN and the Des Moines Register for their integrity.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Almost a chance for them to prove that they are worthy of joining the gang.The -year-old runs Stand United community group which was set up following the death of -year-old family friend Tashaun Aird who was brutally kned to death in Stoke Newington.The teenager was set upon and kned in the chest and back despite telling his attackers he was not part of the Hackney gang, Red Pitch.She added: “Stoke Newington has always been considered the posher side of Hackney and was thought of being up-and-coming.“Some houses are worth more than £million. So what you are essentially saying to younger people is that they can’t afford to buy anything nice around here.“The expensive houses are right next to the poorer parts which does create a rt, it creates a class barrier.“Young people feel as though they are not going to afford a nice place where they’re from unless they join a gang and sell drugs.“Young people are confused and that mentality needs to change.“Gang members aren’t just targeting other gangs – it can happen to anyone. It can be a case of mistaken identity or someone can get caught in the crossfire.“The people in the gangs are also getting younger, some are as young as  and they have no fear. They feel as they can do as they please.”Lara, who as a detention officer sees first hand the trouble on the streets also told a sobering tale of a young boy who pulled out a -inch kne asit was normal when he was arrested.Another Stoke Newington mum, Lena Corner highlighted the issue by appearing on Question Time last week to say her -year-old son had been mugged three times in the past year.The -year-old said: “It’s just that fear he lives with every day. It’s that type of fear you have in your stomach and he has got that.”Just yards from the park where he was mugged, The Sun Online witnessed cops carrying out a stop and search on a group of kids at .pm – highlighting the issues officers are facing in the upmarket area.It comes amid rising fury in the borough – where the majority of residents are aged  to  with young “dependent children” – that not enough is being done to tackle crime.Residents claim the police cant cope with the rise in muggings and stabbings in an area where  burglaries,  robberies and  incidents of anti-social behaviour were recorded last year.Figures show that six per cent of people living in the Stoke Newington ward are unemployed and statistics show that last year , crimes were investigated – but just  offenders were dealt with in court.Another resident added: “It’s getting out of hand in the area – the recent stabbings on Shakspeare Walk, the drug dealing – and the police can’t cope, undoubtedly due to cuts.”Lara, a mum of two young children and two older stepsons, is now calling on parents to do more and spot the early signs of gang grooming.She said: “Parents need to know the signstheir child is being groomed by a gang.“If young people are carrying hundreds of pounds, why are they carrying that amount  How have they got that money “We want to educate parents to spot these signs early and maybe these terrible things on the streets won’t happen.”Lara also highlighted how there are at least four gangs in the Stoke Newington area covering the N post code.She added: “Children will start with mugging and that’s how it begins.“It is happening right on your doorstep, it might not be your children, but it’s happening.“We want to work with parents and local schools to educate children and adults that there is a dferent path they can go down. They can turn their le around.”Her aunt, Mercinth Anderson, , who also helped set up Stand United, said her friend was forced to move her -year-old son back to Jamaica over fears he will get caught up in gang violence.She added: “Unfortunately children are becoming easy targets because they have all of the latest equipment and gear.“They have become too materialistic and have the latest headphones, trainers and smartphones. It is easy pickings for these gangs.“Parents need to think twice about buying their children the latest iPhone because it could make their kids easy targets.“My son was nearly mugged  years ago when he was  outside the police station, the people that are doing it have no shame and no fear.“I’ve been living here  years and this is the worst I’ve seen. I used to tell my son to be home before it was dark and before a certain time.“But timing and whether it’s dark or not doesn’t seem to bother children now. They just don’t care.”The mum-of-one, who organises the Stand United meetings at the local Pedro Club, added: “My friend had to move her son back to Jamaica because of what is going on in London.“But some people aren’t able to do that. They either don’t have family living where or they can’t afford to move away.”University lecturer and local resident Caroline Bolam slammed authorities for “ghetto-ising” the area – and blamed the council for pedestrianising streets.She said: “The council needs to look at the impact of its traffic plans, and there has been a signicant rise in crime since these closures were introduced.“My concern is that the council is ghetto-ising the area – creating quiet alleyways with no cars or headlights where kids can congregate.”It comes as Sun Online analysis of crime stats show the area – made up of around  streets – suffered  violent or sexual offences in .There were also  vehicle crimes,  drug offences and  cases of criminal damage and arson in the area.Just eight per cent of offences investigated in the area resulted in a suspect being charged. Of these, only three per cent of offenders have been dealt with by a court.A further five per cent of cases were dealt with by police through punishments such as a warning or a caution.Met Police statistics claim  per cent of the , offences reported last year are still under investigation. Four per cent have been closed with no further action taken.Stoke Newington has become blighted by kne crime and sits in the borough of Hackney, which has one of the worst kne possession rates in London.In November , there were  kne-point robberies on Brooke Road and Narford Road alone.In each incident cash and debit cards were stolen from terried victims.Dad-of-five Steven Brown, , died after being stabbed in the heart outside a builder’s merchants on Mathias Road on April  last year.A total of  people have been arrested in connection with the broad daylight attack and later released or bailed. So far no-one has been charged.Just last month, police released CCTV of a suspect after a member of staff was glassed in the face and two others were punched in the face inside the Three Crowns pub on Stoke Newington High Street.Mum-of-three Mrs Corner told Question Time her son was mugged by an older gang who threatened to stab him in January last year before being targeted again in broad daylight in Clissold Park.The third mugging came just a week later in the same park when a gang took his phone and forced him to give then his cash card PIN number and Apple ID.She later told Thegetting mugged has become “the norm” for local children and said cops “completely bungled” efforts to catch her son’s attacker.Mrs Corner also blamed the number of children excluded from schools and cuts to policing for the increase in muggings.She said: “It’s not a good way to spend your childhood.

I suddenly had to find a months money.I didnt know what I was going to do.Nichola, who works for a charity and used to be a benefits adviser, wasnt eligible for the Flexible Support Fund or a budgeting loan to help with the costs.She added: I looked at every opportunity for some help, but I dont have a wealthy family, or someone in the area to look after my child.Nichola says the current system unfairly penalises lower earners, when other childcare systems dont require Brits to fork up upfront.And like many working mums, over the school holidays she has to folk out thousands of pounds extra upfront too.Its women who are struggling the most here,  per cent of single-parent families are women, she added.I dread to think what its like for people on minimum wage, how they can afford it.How can you justy paying childcare costs upfront for someone earning £, in advance, but not someone who is on £, Its so frustrating, so detrimental, to iniduals lives, and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Luckily her new job allowed her to cut her hours and work from home to make the situation work for her.But she hopes the DWP will shake-up the system for it to help others in future get back into work.A DWP spokesperson said: We cannot comment on an ongoing case."},{"url":null,"title":"eu uk leave brexit independent","story":"Forty-seven years and  days after we joined. Three decades since the rot set in with the drive towards a United States of Europe. Seven years after David Cameron promised a referendum and ½ traumatic years since Leave won it. It is hard to exaggerate the magnitude of this moment.Or the relief that Brexit, after all the ision and rancour, will at last be done. That our democracy ­ultimately prevailed over those who fought to thwart it.Other EU nations saw their referendums overturned or ignored. We would not be bullied into a rethink.It is true that nothing much will change this year during the “transition period”. But at pm Brexit becomes irreversible.We will be the first country to leave the EU. And in The Sun’s view we will never rejoin, never again surrender our independence.Instead we will be firing the starting gun on a new era full of excitement, potential and promise:The birth of a new Britain, setting our own laws, controlling our borders and trading independently with the entire world.This will not be Little Britain — quite the opposite. Brexit is not some nostalgic fantasy about the Empire.We will be outward-looking, a magnet for the brightest and best migrants — and for those already making a living here, a permanent, welcoming home.Many Sun readers will be ecstatic to be out. Some not so much. We understand that.But this paper — which was always pro-Common Market but increasingly eurosceptic as the EU grabbed more and more of our ­sovereignty — backed leaving all the way.So we want to pay tribute here to the heroes of Brexit, the men and women without whom it would never have happened:Boris Johnson, who went from eurosceptic Brussels reporter to charismatic figurehead of the Leave campaign and finally to the Prime Minister whose election victory last December  assured he could deliver Brexit.Michael Gove, his cerebral and articulate Cabinet ally who sacriced political and personal friendships to fight for his principles.Dominic Cummings, the campaign genius who with Matthew Elliott and the Vote Leave team triumphed against huge odds in  and last year helped orchestrate Boris’s ­decisive win at the polls.Nigel Farage, the controversial former Ukip chief whose pressure forced David Cameron in  to offer a referendum — and whose Brexit Party then terried the Tories into getting serious about delivering Brexit in full . . . out of the single market and customs union.Dan Hannan, the brains behind the project for  years, whose powers of persuasion rallied Tories to the cause. His ally Douglas Carswell was pivotal too.Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith, Steve Baker, Bill Cash and their ERG of Tory backbenchers whose refusal to compromise was admirable, evenThe Sun did despair of it when it threatened to destroy Brexit entirely.They have been vindicated. As has the ERG’s founder, the late ex-Tory MP Michael Spicer.We salute the Tory Cabinet ministers who campaigned for Brexit — notably Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers.From the Labour benches, Gisela Stuart and Kate Hoey shattered the Left’s bizarre consensus that the EU is a near-flawless bastion of liberal values and backed Leave.Ex-Labour MP Caroline Flint, like millions of other Remainers, insisted that upholding the result and our democracy was paramount.But other heroes and heroines planted the seeds of Brexit much earlier.Such as Corbyn’s idol Tony Benn, who before the first referendum on our Common Market membership in  rightly said it “would mean the end of Britain as a completely self-governing nation”.Margaret Thatcher, who in  discovered EC president Jacques Delors plotting to hand back union powers she had removed. She was having none of that — as her famous Bruges speech made clear.Later, as calls grew for yet more Brussels control, she told the Commons: “No, no, no.”The Sun’s “Up Yours, Delors” front page in  summarised our own feelings.Eurosceptic tycoon James Goldsmith launched the Referendum Party in  with just one policy: a vote on EU membership. Three years later Ukip picked up the baton.But not all our Brexit heroes backed Brexit.Many of its most outspoken opponents inadvertently steered millions towards Leave, hardened their resolve and even turned Remainers into Brexiteers:David Cameron, who promised a referendum he was far too confident he would win and catastrophically misjudged the electorate.George Osborne, whose apocalyptic predictions failed to terry Leave voters.Angela Merkel, whose refusal to give Cameron a better deal for Britain cost both dear.And the EU’s Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier, whose sneering and threats emboldened rather than cowed us. Likewise the EUParliament’s Guy Verhofstadt, who foolishly let a camera crew capture his team boasting of turning the UK into a “colony”. Imagine the effect that had.Then, of course, there’s Jeremy ­Corbyn, who damaged the Remain campaign and then gted Boris a stonking mandate.And ex-Lib Dem leader Jo “revoke Brexit” Swinson, who agreed to last month’s election under the delusion she could win it — but managed only to lose her own seat.There’s John Bercow, the ex-Speaker whose blatant bias and constitutional trickery convinced Leavers they made the right call. And his arrogant Tory co-conspirators Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, who hoped to establish a Remainer pseudo-Government to enforce a second referendum — testing the public’s patience to their own destruction.Let’s not forget too the former Tories who merely pretended to “respect the referendum”, notably Anna Soubry, who then said single market and customs union membership was inevitable and charmingly told Leavers: “Suck it up”. And how about the glittering cast of Remoaner foghorns Take Tony Blair who, but for The Sun and others, would have forced us  years ago into the disastrous euro — the “burning building with no exits” as William Hague accurately described it.Blair, who then opened our borders to a flood of low-skilled migrants, ­further exposing the folly of free movement.Or his old spin doctor Alastair Campbell and former lackey Andrew Adonis, whose deranged doom-mongering and playground insults hardened Leavers’ hearts and repelled pragmatic Remainers at the same time.Or John Major, whose decision to adopt the  Maastricht Treaty, tying us even closer to the EU — but without a referendum — turbo-charged euroscepticism. A man whose increasingly shrill anti-Brexit outbursts merely convinced Leavers they were right.And how about the clueless celebs who thought abusing Leavers would compel them to think the “correct” thoughts  Or the BBC, whose routine europhile propaganda delivered vast numbers of votes for Leave  But there are Brexit heroes still greater than any of these:They are the .million voters, many Sun readers among them, who braved every threat and every slur, backed Leave in  and stuck to their guns last December.The Sun salutes you.Brexit will not be plain sailing. We are under no illusions. But we are convinced a fully independent Britain has a rosier future.And YOU made it happen. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last we will take back control of trade, human rights and migration.You will forgive us I hope, Mr Juncker, a moment of celebration as we raise a glass to an independent and prosperous future. It has been a hard path to get to this point — one you, of all people, know.But as we drink and make merry you — and everyone  from Amsterdam to Zakynthos — should know this.We are not going to wake up tomorrow morning feeling any less European.Ireland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands will still be our neighbours.We will still be eating Brie and driving Volkswagens, and we will still be sending brown saucein the other direction.Indeed, we might now feel more European.No longer will we have to worry about those fabled traffic jams which were going to block the M. We won’t be bothered about the planes not taking off or shelves emptying of fresh food.We will be able to get on with sharing and enjoying European civilisation.We will still be watching European football matches and knocking back German beer.

Europe can go back to being synonymous with culture, good food, great landscapes.And we are in good company. After all, is Switzerland less European for not being part of the EU  Hardly.It sits right in the middle of Europe, with thousands crossing the border every day.Is Norway less Scandinavian for choosing not to be part of the same political bloc as Sweden and Denmark  Nei!Tomorrow we will be just as European as we have been for the past  years.The EU loves slogans such as “European family of nations”.

The conditions are right to put the ­ision and rancour behind us. For our United Kingdom to be truly united.That will mean Leavers respecting and understanding their opponents’ sorrow. A tall order, perhaps, given the vitriol they have endured, but essential.It will mean the more extreme Remainers ending the abuse — and resisting the temptation to seize triumphantly on any setbacks that now arise. Indeed, it would be better to let the very terms “Leavers” and “Remainers” fall into irrelevance and disuse.Ours is a great country, of course, but one with substantial problems and a deep ­economic ide.The new freedoms over our laws, money, borders and trade — and our powerful new Government — can be catalysts for a vibrant, energetic, prosperous and more harmonious new era where wealth and opportunity are sp evenly across the country.It can be achieved by everyone coming together.

We will be better off outside it — and the  other nations may well be too without our opposition holding them back.

Brexit parties were held from Cornwall to Cumbria.Parliament Square was awash with Union Jacks as Nigel Farage had a beano that he had been planning for  years, chucking a metaphorical milkshake over everyone who ever dissed him.But this was not VE Day.Where Brexit was celebrated, the mood was one of patriotic pride rather than euphoria unbound.This was a very British departure — respectful, self-effacing and anxious not to cause offence.We refrained from sticking up two fingers. We were scrupulously polite.The UK started le outside the EU with no Big Ben ringing the chimes of freedom, no firework display setting the post-Brexit sky ablaze, no laser show on the white clfs of Dover.The big moment came at pm rather than midnight — the UK, now as always, a little out of step with our continental cousins in Brussels — so it did not even feel like New Year’s Eve.By midnight — already am in sleepy old Brussels — the party was winding down.As we left the EU, Downing Street lit up with red, white and blue lasers and an image of Big Ben, complete with a recording of the bongs.But the door of  Downing Street stayed firmly shut as the Prime Minister hosted a private party for staff.For all the nation knew, Boris could have been having an early night with Carrie and Dilyn the dog.Downing Street was as deserted as the Marie Celeste.Here was the strangest thing about Friday night — the total absence of Boris Johnson.The PM had recorded a speech full of optimistic talk about making Brexit a “storming success” and bringing the nation back together.But the BBC and ITV both refused to broadcast the speech, as Downing Street aides had refused to let them film it.Soyou wanted to see what the British Prime Minister said about this truly momentous moment in British history, you could not have seen it on our state broadcaster’s channels. UNBELIEVABLE.The BBC news studio was bathed in Brussels blue, asin mourning — so censoring Boris felt small-minded, ­churlish and petty beyond belief.I strongly suspect that ­refusing to broadcast Boris’s big Brexit-night speech will turn out to be the beginning of the end for the licence fee.If the BBC cannot look like a state broadcaster on a night of historic national importance, then it never will.But we didn’t need the Beeb to tell us that this was history happening before our eyes.The biggest mandate for anything in British history had FINALLY been honoured. Democracy had triumphed.After more than  years inside the European federalist experiment, the British people were masters of their own destiny once more. And while the national mood on Friday night was respectful for the feelings of the losers, perhaps that was because there is no need for ­triumphalism when you know you have won.The clock struck pm and Leavers and Remainers were all suddenly extinct.All those eye-swivelling nutjobs threatening to shove a Brexit p coin up their pious rectums in protest no longer seemed like a threat to ­democracy.They seemed worthy of pity.But after all the toxic ­isions of the past four years, the wounds will not heal quickly.The most vicious insult thrown at those of us who dared to vote to leave the EU was that we would all soon be dead. And so it is a bitter irony to reflect that Tony Blair, Michael Heseltine, John Major, Lord Adonis, Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and all the rest will never live long enough to drag us back into the European Union.At long last, Brexit’s uncivil war is done.And why Because the roots of British democracy run deep.Once we had voted to leave, it was ultimately unthinkable that we would ever remain — despite the fervent wishes of almost the entire British establishment, from the House of Lords and House of Commons to the civil service, the BBC and big business.Once the people had spoken, in the end they had to be obeyed.No parliamentary paralysis could ever stop Brexit. No clever lawyers could thwart it forever.That historic moment on Friday night felt it had an historic inevitability about it.British democracy could not be denied. How did the arrogant, out-of-touch establishment ever imagine they could overrule the largest vote for anything in our history So au revoir, monsieur, and adios, senor and bye-bye, mein liebe herr. Except — we are not leaving Europe, are we We are only leaving the European Union — that unloved, corrupt, expansionist empire.And the British people have nothing but love in their souls for Europe.Here’s the great Brexit irony. The British are probably the most pro-European nation on the continent. We revere European culture, drink their wine, holiday at their beaches, cities and moun-tains, eat their fruit, vegetables and cheese and buy their cars.But the British have always been a lousy fit in the EU.We do not like having leaders who we cannot kick out.We do not enjoy unelected old geezers in foreign cities telling us who can and can’t come into our country.We — one of the oldest democracies in the world, a country that has not been invaded for , years — truly do not need anyone  to make our laws or to tell us what justice looks like.The EU just lost its second-largest contributor while the largest contributor — Germany — teeters on the edge of recession.We should try to be understandingthey sound bitter.Our stormy relationship with the EU has lasted all my adult le.The first time I ever voted was in the  referendum, when I girded my flared jeans and enthusiastically voted “Yes to Europe”.But like my nation, over the course of the decades I fell out of love with the EU.Like my nation, I began to feel that I had been lied to about what the project really meant.Like my nation — and around .million of my countrymen in  — the thought of “ever greater union” made my skin crawl. For I believed with all my heart and soul that my great nation’s identity is worth preserving.Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, sneers that the UK must “come to terms with the fact that it is now a small country”.Leo’s line is that the UK is now an isolated little rain-lashed rock, cowering timidly off the coast of the mighty European Union empire.But it doesn’t feel like we are a small nation today.It feels like we are a global nation once again, open for business with the world.It feels like we are the world’s sixth-largest economy, a cultural superpower, a warrior nation with a nuclear deterrent and the best armed forces in the world, the oldest parliamentary democracy on the planet and the longest-reigning monarch in history.All of that, plus the new added ingredient of post-Brexit va-va-voom.And in a Europe blighted by fragile coalitions and leaders with feet of blancmange, the UK boasts a popular Prime Minister presiding over the strongest, most stable government in Europe.British democracy has a far longer history than the European Union.If we were a small nation, then we would never have had the guts to leave the EU.If we were a small nation, then after the EU referendum of , we would have done what all those other EU countries did when they came up with a referendum result that Brussels didn’t like.We would have voted again, until Michel Barnier put down his cane.But the UK was always dferent.Unlike so many of our neighbours, we have not known the terror of fascism and communism, we have never experienced the jackboots of an invading army on our land, we have never seen our country chopped up by cruel foreign conquerors.We are a small nation in size but, through the centuries, we have always proved too big to bully.And what now The extremist voices — on both sides of the Brexit debate — will fade away because extremism is never the British way.Even with a year of transition and haggling about trade ahead, Brexit feels like it is slipping into the history books.The EU referendum in the summer of  seems long ago now.But as I recall, all we ever wanted was for our country to be a self-governing, sovereign nation once more and to restore the freedoms bought with the sacrice of the generations who came before us.Big Ben was silent on Friday night, but did you hear the church bells ring in all the faraway towns That is the sound of a country that just got its mojo back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last year from April to December, we received more than , boxes.“They’ve all got to be opened and,there’s an email address, acknowledged.“We try to be organised but you are talking about cardboard boxes with pants in them, all labelled, on the floor.”The charity started out small in  with Maria asking friends and family to donate towards a target of , pants for charities in Africa.She was overwhelmed when she received , pairs and delivered them to orphanages, hospitals and refugee camps in Kenya.She said: “These kids do not have underwear, they’re wearing rags and sometimes plastic bags.”Maria registered the charity in  and was working with friends from her home in Livingston, West Lothian.She said: “I managed it really well until  when we went viral on Facebook. We went from  likes to , in a week.”Maria recruited more volunteers and left her insurance job to go part-time at the charity.She said: “Imagine you didn’t have any underwear – how would you go about your day “Our work means girls get to go to school and stay in school.CARING husband and we Terry and Annette Marsh were so disappointed by the lack of sports facilities for ­disabled youngsters in their area, they decided to set up a club just for a few months.That was more than  years ago and the Hampshire Harriers has since gone on to help hundreds of young people, disabled and able-bodied, to participate in sports on equal terms.Wheelchair basketball is the club’s forte and many of its members have gone on to gain confidence and better health while several have excelled to ­represent Great Britain.New arrivals to the club, however, often find their heavy wheelchairs make it dficult to compete, so Terry and Annette visit schools regularly with the old-style chairs to show able-bodied pupils just how hard it is for their disabled classmates to get around.Modern, lightweight made-to-measure sports wheelchairs are expensive, ranging from £, to £,-plus, but the donation of £, from The Sun Readers’ Fund will buy new wheelchairs for four more disabled youngsters.Retired labourer Terry, , who is still the head coach and treasurer for the Portsmouth-based club, said: “I was shocked when I heard we had been chosen to receive the money from Sun readers. It’s wonderful and will make a real dference.”He added: “We’ve got one young lad who is typical. His father said he used to sit at home all day just playing on his computer because he felt he could not get involved in sport because of his ­disability.

It changed our lives forever.“Maddi hated hospitals and despite how poorly she was, she was determined to come home for Christmas in her final year.She managed to open her main present, an iPad, and although she was too ill to eat, she sat with the whole family for Christmas dinner, taking it all in.“She had fought so hard, stayed so positive and suffered so much.When she left us the next day it was ­gentle and peaceful.”A precious family break at a caravan in Blackpool during Maddi’s final months inspired Samantha to offer the same opportunity to others.She says: “The ­caravan is somewhere families can relax and spend happy time together.“Travelling abroad is often impossible, but this is accessible to everyone.”But the charity struggled with the costs and came near to having to close down.Samantha says: “When I heard we were going to receive The Sun money, I cried with relief.“Maddi was our hero, and her strength and determination in le continues through ­us helping other children like her.”THEY are a hardy bunch in the ­Scarborough And Ryedale Mountain Rescue Team.

I decided against getting smashed in front of the TV watching Johnson’s Churchillian B-Day speech, although I stuck a tenner on him saying “we’ll kick them off the beaches”. I didn’t get down to the Parliament Square gloat-fest to hear everyone do a Vera Lynn as it looked a bit Eartha Kitt. And I wasn’t invited to the anti-elitist Vote Leave celebration in venture capitalist Jon Moynihan’s £million Cha mansion, so I missed Jacob Rees-Mogg dressed as Prince singing “tonight one’s going to party like it’s ”. I just sat at home, making bonging noises with the cat’s litter tray at pm, thinking of the future. And I decided to embrace it. That’s right. No more Brexit angst from me. No more remoaning. It’s time to move on. So as I wrap myself in my Got Brexit Done tea towel, let me raise a glass of Wetherspoon’s Sparkling White Clfs of Dover wine, and point out all the reasons we have to be cheerful now we’ve left the EU. Homeless beggars will get a boost as half the country refuses to have the new Brexit coin in their pocket and tosses it to them.

But the former European Council president warned the process of rejoining would not be automatic.Speaking on the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Tusk said he felt very Scottish following Brexit, adding that Scotland would be treated with empathythey gain independence and look for a place at the EU table.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has signalled an intention to rejoin the European Union as a member should Scotland leave the UK. In the  Brexit referendum, % of Scottish voters voted to stay in the EU and Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly said Scots are being taken out of the bloc against their will. On Friday, German MEP and European Greens co-president Ska Keller said it would be stupid of the  EU member states to veto the membership of an independent Scotland. The comments from Mr Tusk come after a YouGov poll which showed % support for independence - a majority for the first time in five years. However, a majority of Scots surveyed also said they would not like to see another vote on the issue in  or , but most said they would like to see another referendum within the next five years.  Mr Tusk was initially reluctant to comment on Scotlandaposs place in Europe, saying he would like to respect the sovereignty of the UK - a major issue during the Brexit campaign. He said: I want to stop myself from saying something too blunt. But sometimes I feel like Iaposm a Scot - I feel like Iaposm Scottish, especially after Brexit. But at the same time, I know how important the word sovereignty and integrity were in the internal debate in the United Kingdom. I feel like it is not my role to intervene.

I’d been enjoying some precious time with my parents, away from my hectic modelling career, and thought exhaustion had got the better of me. But as I got up and attempted to walk to the bedroom, I felt as though I was drunk. I tried desperately to speak, but all I could do was mumble, so my worried parents rushed me to hospital. There, to my horror, I started losing control of my body and could no longer move my arms or legs. ‘I’m not paralysed,’ I told my mum, ‘I’m just too tired to talk.’ That was  January , and those were the last words I would ever say out loud. Before long, I couldn’t move anything except my left eye, and for the next eight hours baffled doctors ran tests. I remember hearing the word ‘stroke’, but a doctor dismissed it, saying, ‘She’s too young.’  I was only  they were convinced there must be a dferent explanation. The feeling of terror and panic was indescribable. I couldn’t understand what was happening and I was even struggling to breathe. I tried to move, but my body wouldn’t respond, and although I wanted to speak, no sound came out. My mum told me to blink once for yes and twice for no, and that was the only way I could communicate. Three days later, I had an MRI scan and the news was catastrophic. A neurologist explained I’d suffered a stroke and that the damage was so severe I’d never be able to move again. ‘What happened to Kati is as unlikely as winning the lottery jackpot,’ he said, as he explained I had locked-in syndrome, where the messages from the brain don’t get through to the muscles. He told us the average stroke takes six minutes, but mine had lasted  hours, so the damage was irreversible. It’s hard to react when you can’t move, but I remember feeling utter shock and misery. It was too much to take in. I had a successful career as a model, I worked in amazing places, like Italy, America and the Bahamas, and was living my childhood dream. But now everything had been cruelly ripped away. I spent a month in hospital and regained the use of my right eye, so a speech therapist taught me to communicate using a letter board. I could also breathe better by then, so doctors removed a tube from my throat and I was transferred to a rehab clinic. Emotionally, though, I hit rock bottom. Every time I woke up and realised nothing had changed, a fresh wave of despair and agony washed over me. I was grieving for my old le and felt utterly heartbroken. At the clinic, I made small improvements. I was able to make tiny movements in my neck, jaw and legs, which meant I could support my own neck and make tiny kicks.  I learnt how to chew food and how to use a hands-free computer, where an infrared camera is mounted on the monitor and picks up the reflection of a little sticker on my forehead, which allows me to move the mouse. After seven months there was nothing more the therapists could do for me, and they advised my parents to put me in an institution. Horried, they refused and took me home, where a day nurse cared for me. I might not have been able to speak, but I could make noise and cried constantly, howling so loudly a neighbour askedmy parents had a new dog. I wanted to die and begged my mum to kill me. I felt embarrassed, humiliated and demeaned. A few months later, I started a diary and it became a sort of therapy. Little by little, I started to heal emotionally.  Writing gave me a purpose and eventually helped me see that I could still have a le worth living. I tried every therapy and treatment, but nothing worked, and after three years of crushed hopes, I’d had enough. I wanted to live and be happy, so I had to adapt to my new circumstances. I started a blog to help others dealing with complex medical needs, and slowly began to appreciate the small things in le. It’s amazing how much pleasure you can get from feeling the sun on your face. My attitude to le changed again in , when I met a man called Henning online. We talked about music, our homes and families, and I was struck by how similarly we viewed le. I was reluctant to tell him about my condition straight away, but he noticed my wheelchair and said, ‘You must be an extraordinary person.’ I told him I had locked-in syndrome, expecting him to beat a retreat, but he carried on our conversations. Eight months later, I was on my way to Calornia via Amsterdam, where Henning lived, and decided to stopover for a night so we could meet. I was with my mother and care assistant, and Henning met us at check-in and took me for a stroll. Instantly, we felt like two old friends.  We got on so well that I stopped over on my way back too. Henning visited twice that summer and we fell so deeply in love that on Christmas Eve, , he moved countries to be with me. We stayed with my parents while renovating our own home to make it wheelchair accessible. Initially, living together was harder than I expected. I felt under enormous pressure because I was concerned about losing my privacy and my sense of self. Most of all, I was worried things would end and I’d be heartbroken, but they never did. Instead our bond grew deeper, and Henning got so good at using my Plexiglas ‘air alphabet’ board to communicate that soon he didn’t need the board, as he could just follow my eyes. Henning and I married on  December . It was a beautul, snowy day, and as we said our vows in an old mansion house, I can honestly say I’ve never felt happier.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailGrowing up, Emma Cooper had adored her dad Ray. The two were so close her three siblings used to joke she was his favourite. After he died in a motorcycle crash in  when she was , Emma was devastated. And, because of her wonderful memories of him, she put a disturbing nagging doubt she had always felt to the back of her mind. Why did she look so dferent to the dad she loved  Twelve years later, as Emma planned her wedding, her suspicions were further aroused when she ordered her birth certicate for the wedding paperwork, and she found no father listed. Those childhood doubts came rushing back – and Emma was unconvinced by mum Frances’ explanation that she and Ray had not been together when she was born. Last year Emma finally gave in to her curiosity and took a £ ancestry DNA test, and she uncovered the bombshell family secret her mum and some other family members had kept from her – Ray wasn’t her real dad. She eventually discovered that her biological father was Trevor Ranger – an -year-old her mum had had an affair with when she was in her s. And it turned out he had lived just down the road from her throughout her childhood. Now she has traced him – and they are making up for those long lost years apart. “I’ve been brought up on a lie – the family secret,” said Emma, now . If I had been told the truth, it would never have been as hurtful as what I’ve been through emotionally. “The lies have been so damaging compared to what the truth would have been.”  Now she is thinking about renewing her wedding vows with husband Pete,  – so her biological father can walk her down the aisle. “All of a sudden I’ve got this parent who’s like me – we keep the same breeds of dogs, we both like our cars and we both like sailing,” she said. “We even have the same crap taste in wine. It’s wonderful.” Hugging her, Trevor, , said: “I was really pleased to hear from her. We need to make up for lost time.” Both share the same blue eyes and fair skin – it was Ray’s black hair and olive skin that always confused the young Emma. Yet Ray had always treated her as his own, and as she grew into her late teens he taught her guitar and also took her for spins on his motorbike.  “We were so close, but it always really bothered me I couldn’t see any similarities,” said Emma, of Rochester, Kent.Her insecurities were reinforced after his death at  when she claims her mum, now , went cold on her. Their relationship deteriorated and they haven’t spoken since . At Easter last year, Emma persuaded her older sister to take an ancestry DNA test with her. The results showed her sister could only be a half-sibling – meaning Ray was not her birth father. She decided to ask her aunts what they knew, and finally discovered the truth.  Emma was told her mother had slept with -year-old Trevor when she was in her early s. “When I knew the truth, I couldn’t really take it in,” Emma said. “All sorts of things go through your head.” The aunts also told Emma some of her family members had known all along and had been sworn to secrecy. She used social media and the electoral roll to find out where Trevor lived and then she wrote to him with contact detailshe wanted to see her. “I agonised over what to put in it,” she said. “I didn’t want to give too much information away about myself. I was frightened. “Was he a good person  Was he going to be some strange drunkard ” Trevor emailed her saying he was surprised but pleased to hear from her. He revealed he had always felt ashamed about how things had gone with her mum.  The moment they met, Emma stared into his matching blue eyes and knew he was her birth father. As they hugged for the first time, she says she thought about all of the family moments she had missed out on over the years. “He could have been there at my wedding,” she said. “I always wanted someone to walk me down the aisle. I’ve missed out on grandparents. I’ve been looking through his family photo albums, and I’ve not been part of any of it.” Trevor’s family have welcomed her with open arms. She has a new half-sister a few years younger than she is. Now Emma and Trevor enjoy sailing together on his boat along the River Medway. “There’s a security in spending time with close family members, and I didn’t appreciate how much I craved that,” said Emma.Trevor added: “A lot of time has been lost. I expected her to come looking when she was  or . Now we’re hoping to go on holidays together and spend a lot more time together on the boat.” He hopes she goes ahead with her idea of renewing her wedding vows. “I would love to walk her down the aisle, it’s something I’ve missed,” he said.

The virus, which originated in a seafood market in Wuhan, China, has so far killed more than  people. Tens of thousands more have been infected with the virus worldwide, with health officials dubbing it a global health emergency. While authorities rush to stop the spread of the illness, Scot Kate Broderick is working in a lab in San Diego to create a vaccine, the BBC reports.  She is working at Inovioaposs lab, in a team using a new type of DNA technology to work on a potential vaccine.  There are plans to enter human trials of INO- - as itaposs currently called - by the early summer. Kate, senior vice-president of research and development, said development began soon after Chinaaposs provision of the DNA sequence of the virus. We were able to put it through our labaposs computer technology and design a vaccine within three hours, she told the BBC. Our DNA medicine vaccines are novel in that they use DNA sequences from the virus to target specic parts of the pathogen which we believe the body will mount the strongest response to.  We then use the patientaposs own cells to become a factory for the vaccine, strengthening the bodyaposs own natural response mechanisms. If the initial human trials are a success, larger trials would follow, ideally in an outbreak setting in China by the end of the year. It is impossible to predict whether this outbreak is likely to have ended by then. ButInovioaposs timeline goes to plan, the company says it will be the quickest a new vaccine has ever been developed and tested in an outbreak situation. The last time a similar virus - Sars - emerged in  - China was slow to let the world know what was happening. So by the time work on a vaccine started in earnest, the outbreak was almost over.

Iris, , says of the PM: “He has got a young girlfiend... he should understand.” She claims UK diplomats in Cairo blocked her marrying Mohamed Ahmed Irbriham, . Iris says Mohamed “is an Adonis... I call him my pharaoh – and he calls me Cleopatra”. She went viral after the Sunday Mirror revealed her story last week, then she appeared on TV revealing details of her first night with Mohamed – and how they used “a whole tube of KY Jelly”. Now Iris hopes Boris, who at  is is  years older than partner Carrie Symonds, will sympathise. Iris says: “I wrote to Boris because I was desperate. I said, ‘Boris, we’re two people much in love. We just want to be together’. “I wrote, ‘Dear Mr Johnson, I know you are a man with a heart. I want to marry this gentleman from Egypt. We’re meeting obstacles and setbacks. Time isn’t on my side now. I just want to spend my last days with him’.” She tells the Mirror: “People don’t like him as PM, but he’s still a man with needs and desires like all of us. I’d write to the Queen too but she’s enough on with Harry, Meghan and Andrew.”This Morning hosts Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield were in stitches as Iris gave fine detail on bedding Mohamed. But the romeo was mfed. Iris, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, explains: “He wrote a message and said, ‘I am angry. Why tell them about our personal le ’ I said, ‘it just suddenly came out. You have to take the rough with the smooth’. “He is putty in my hands, I can easily calm him down. He said, ‘Thank you my angel’.” Iris has bought her wedding outfit – a £ charity shop bargain. The jacket was £, the dress £. and the fascinator £.We told last week how the pair “met” through a Facebook page. Iris flew to Cairo in November.They went to the British Embassy to check whether they could marry in Egypt. But she didn’t have her orce papers and they also needed a certicate of no impediment to show there was no barrier to getting married.  Iris say she has since sent numerous emails but claims to have been blanked by officials. She meets a registrar tomorrow about a certicate of no impediment and plans a spring wedding in Cairo. Iris hopes towith Mohamed, visa permitting. Her sons, in their s, accept the situation. Iris adds: “At first they hated him.

I have investigated the absence review meetings and the outcome letters sent to you and I am satisfied that the MS absence policy has been followed and no discrimination has taken place. Therefore, I do not uphold this point of your appeal. MS says it cannot aposdiscuss inidual casesapos.

At her lowest point, Bethenie Morgan, , from Wisbech, spent a month in constant hypos - low blood sugar levels which can be dangerous - which led to multiple comas. People who suffer hypos have to act quickly to raise their blood glucose levels. If they donapost, they can become confused, drowsy, or could even fall unconscious or have a fit. I was scared when my partner went to work, she explained, and I was left with the kids on my own I worried that Iaposd have a hypo. Having so many dangerous low blood sugars in such a short period of time meant Bethenie lost awareness of when her blood sugar was going low. Bethenieaposs extreme illness also frightened her children. Her three-year-old boy was constantly worrying about her and askingshe was okay. She was diagnosed with type  diabetes when she was just  months old. She has no memory of le before blood tests, needles and hospital appointments.I donapost remember not being diabetic, she told CambridgeshireLive. It has always been part of my le. The needles never phased me, even when I was injecting up to eight times a day! But even though it was normal to me, I never felt like I controlled my diabetes - the diabetes controlled me. It was the birth of her twins, Lily-Rose and Albie which prompted Beth and her husband to speak to her team at Queen Elizabeth hospital about what could be done to make her condition easier to manage, and less dangerous to live with. As Bethenie had been diabetic for so many years, and had had so many injections of insulin, her body started to stop absorbing the insulin as effectively - she was becoming resisent.  She described how she went through so many types of insulin but no matter what we did, it didnapost seem to work with me. Now Bethenie has been given a leline in the form of a revolutionary piece of technology, which will help her manage her type  diabetes. In July Bethenie was put onto a MiniMed G, she was the first person in the region to be put onto the brand new type of insulin pump. The MiniMed G is the worldaposs first self-adjusting insulin pump system. This means thatBethenieaposs blood sugar levels start to drop, the pump will automatically stop giving her insulin - which would cause her levels to drop further. The G is also the first and only pump which can automate the delivery of her basal insulin  hours a day, which is the background insulin level to keep her blood sugar levels stable. This marks an important step toward a fully automated closed loop system - which would work as a form of articial pancreas.  For Bethenie, this new technology is le-changing, as she struggled to keep her blood glucose levels in a safe range. She added: But I had my kids andthis is going to give me a better quality of le, and I can play with the kids and not panic and not have to check my glucose levels every half hour... You have to put so much trust into a tiny little device that has so many aspects that can go wrong, it can get blocked or the cannula pulled out. Bethenie has already noticed a huge change, not only in theof her hypo symptoms, but in her HbAc, a measure of average blood glucose levels over the last two to three months. The ideal HbAc reading is  mmol mol, before starting on the pump, Bethenieaposs was , now itaposs down to  - a much safer level which will help not only her immediate quality of le, with blood glucose levels spending more time in range, but also down the line as living with extreme blood sugar levels can cause long-term complications such as blindness, amputation, kidney damage, and heart disease.  Bethenie said: I have been using the G together with the CGM system since September, and it has been le changing. I canapost believe how much more in range my blood glucose levels have become. I still have some hypos, but far fewer, and Iaposve even started to re-gain hypo awareness. I think the biggest dference though, is that I can properly sleep at night without stressing that I might have a hypo, it feels so freeing. Her kids have seen a dference in Bethenie too.

Samantha McKayaposs run of good luck started when the -year-old logged onto a bingo site for the first time in over a year and placed a bet for just £. The mum-of-two was gobsmacked when she won £, and decided to test her luck again. Samantha placed a final bet for £ – the largest amount possible on the site – and couldn’t believe it when she won another £,.  Along with partner Damien, , Samantha had been saving to buy a house for nearly  years, but had just been turned down for a mortgage. Now the couple have bought a three-bed property outright with the winnings. With the leftover cash, Samantha bought her mum Julie, , a holiday caravan, and sheaposs now gone back to work in the barber shop she owns. Samantha, a self-employed hairdresser, from Porthcawl, Wales, said: “When I saw the amount flash up screen I nearly died – I couldn’t believe. “My husband and I have been saving for nearly  years and we were even competing to see who could save the most each month. “When I sat him down and told him I’d been playing online bingo, I think he thought I’d blown our savings.  “Then I told him that’d won. He was in absolute shock when I said it was over £,. “It still doesn’t feel real that we own our house – it’s more than we could have dreamed. Samantha, who lives at home with partner Damien and daughter Ellie, , would regularly play on the bingo site ladies in , placing £ bets at a time. She decided to cancel her account and have a ‘cool off period’ after failing to land any big wins. Over a year later, Samantha decided to try her luck again after an email from the site prompted her to reactivate her account. Lucky Samantha placed around six £ before she bagged £, - and then upped the ante and placed a £ bet.  Samantha said: “At first I won about £, which was incredible but I’ve won money like that before so I decided to play on a bit. “Then after placing a couple of £ bets I suddenly won £,.  Samantha kept the news to herself all day until her husband Damien had ed home from work. The couple, who previously rented a three-bed property, were also joined that night by Damien’s daughter Lara, .

The Leeds star received his devastating diagnosis in December and was told he may have just one or two years to live. Before that this cruel illness will rob him of his voice – the ability to talk and laugh with his we Lindsey, and children Macy, Jackson and Maya. So Rob has been spending time recording phrases so he can “speak” to them, with an automated communication aid. Just simple things like “stop doing that” and “get down” as “they’re the normal things I say as dad.” And, of course, he’s recorded “I love you” - although Lindsey and the kids won’t ever need reminding of that, I’m sure, not even when he’s gone. But being able to hear the voice of a lost loved one can be a huge comfort. I recently stumbled across a tape-recording of my Mum back in the s, singing, laughing and chatting to me in the kitchen.

Distressing footage shows a group of masked men fitting thick metal bars in front of her door as she screams and yells from inside her house. While one sticks a sign on the wall, others hold long metal bars. The sign reads: This family came back from Wuhan. Stay away, no contact. In the clip, some of the men can be seen filming the scene and taking pictures while they take turns to isolate the family. They all wear masks as they gather all together inside the building. The men take turns to hold the bars as one fits them to the door.

Tim Johnson, , based in Alaska, had been using a run-down vehicle to explore the country until last year when he upgraded to a  Ford F. After an incredible renovation, the truck can host six people, and comes equipped with two sofas, oven, fridge, wood stove, toilet, heating, TV DVD player, USB charging stations, under couch and under floor storage,  watt solar  on roof, firewood storage and even a covered back porch. He uses the vehicle to explore Alaska, and after spending six years in his old home, he can now travel in style with everything needed to make a house, or in this case a truck, a home. Tim said: “My Truck house is perfect, it has everything I need to stay out for as long as I need.” Most of the renovation work was carried out by Tim himself, who picked up DIY skills from his dad. He added: “My Dad builds custom cabins for a living and was self-taught in all of the trades and thataposs who I learned my carpentry and overall DIY skills from. When Timaposs Toyota was on its last legs, he bought a classic Ford truck for just under £, because he wanted to finally create his own dream truck house. “I started modying it last year, fitted an airbag and modied the engine and turbo so it had a little more fire in Its belly, it took me a couple of months to finish, he said. To build the house on the back of the truck cost another £, pushing the overall total up to around £,.  Most of the renovation works were carried out by Tim himself, while a friend skilled in aluminium welding made his front winch bumper. He added: What is great though is that I sold my old truck and, in the end, didn’t have to spend very much on top to fund my new Ford so in truth it hasn’t really cost me anything. “The whole process took me about three months to mody, design and finish the home but I’m really pleased with how it turned out.”  Tim had been living in his old motor-home for six years, but after realising the cost to get it back to pristine condition would be a fortune, he cut ties and started his dream project. He said: “I wasn’t in a rush with this project, I thoughtI was going to do it again, I wanted to do it property and make it exactly how I had pictured it in my head.” “When I figured the cost of my dream truck house could be covered by old, it was a no-brainer.  “I haven’t spent over what I made from selling my old truck, which made about covered most of the cost of my new one, which I think is a much better version of what I had before.

There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.49987743-240x180.jpg

pegged back by former favourite Jim McAlister in the first half.Ton midfielder Kyle Jacobs saw red on  minutes but Dundee couldn#t find a winner despite numerous efforts on goal.New signing Christophe Berra went straight into the XI less than  hours after signing on loan, partnering Jordon Forster in central defence who made his first appearance in six weeks.Conor Hazard replaced Jack Hamilton in goal while Ollie Crankshaw made his first start since joining from Wigan on loan.Missing through injury were Jordan Marshall , who is out long-term, Paul McGowanand Andrew Nelsonleaving the matchday squad a man light.The Dark Blues started on the front foot with energy about them and went close early on as the ball dropped to captain Graham Dorrans inside the area but he sclaffed wide under pressure.On  minutes, they got the breakthrough with Berra coming up with the assist. It was route one stuff as the -cap Scotland international pinged a long ball up to Hemmings. He got the better of debutant Sean McGinty before spinning and firing the ball home.Despite their strong start, Dundee were pegged back on  minutes by former favourite McAlister. Shaun Byrne gave away the free-kick -yards out giving Nicky Cadden a look at goal. His effort took a deflection off the wall and Hazard could only palm the ball out, leaving McAlister with an easy finish.Seconds later Kalvin Orsi fired just over the bar as the home side had their tails up and the same player had the ball in the net from a superb overhead kick eight minutes before the break. The linesman#s flag, though, was already up for offside.After the break, Orsi looked certain to score only for Berra to get a vital toe on the ball at the last moment. The ball, though, careered off Forster#s leg before bobbling wide of the post.On  minutes, Morton were reduced to  men after Kyle Jacobs went in heavily on Hemmings on the halfway line to earn his second yellow of the contest. Home fans weren#t happy after referee Bobby Madden played an advantage before pulling the game back to book Jacobs but the tackle certainly warranted a caution.Moments later and Dundee were inches away from making the extra man count immediately as Declan McDaid curled a good effort off the far post and Forster headed the rebound wide.Hemmings went close two minutes later only for Chris Millar to block before Christie Elliott almost marked his debut with a fine goal after replacing Crankshaw.The former Partick man cut in from his left wing position and hit a fine effort that flew just past the far post.A man light, Morton were happy to hold their shape and sit back while Dundee played the ball around the middle of the park.With eight minutes to go, though, Ton had the chance to steal the points as Orsi rose in the centre of goal but headed wide of the post.In stoppage time, Elliott thought he had grabbed a late winner on his debut but his free-kick clipped the wall and drted just wide of the post with goalie Danny Rogers stranded.Morton: Rogers, Tumilty, McGinty, Jacobs, McAlister, Orsi , Strapp, Cadden , Sutton , Colville, Baird.Subs not used: Ramsbottom, McLean, McHugh, McGuffie.Dundee: Hazard, Kerr, McGhee, Forster, Berra, Byrne, Dorrans, Callachan, McDaid, Crankshaw , Hemmings.Subs not used: Hamilton, Meekings, Robertson, Anderson, Cameron.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50042383-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50042383-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50042383-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50042383-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"roadworks to cause five days of disruption in city centre","story":"Motorists will face major disruption when five days of city centre roadworks begin next week.Resurfacing and maintenance works are being carried out meaning the junction that connects Courier Place, Reform Street and Meadowside will be closed until Saturday.The work will cause problems for taxis drivers as it will cut access to the rank in the Nethergate.Rod Alexander, a -year-old cabbie, said: #It#ll definitely cause a disruption.#I think it#s going to encourage people to take a short cut through the taxis and buses-only lane, which is really not good for us.#People do that already, even though they shouldn#t, and I think that this is just going to encourage that.#It#ll be frustrating to get through.

They were supported by the Malmaison’s team to create a salmon roulade, traditional haggis, neeps and tatties plus a gorgeous cranachan.The pupils said: “We were able to decide as a team what we wanted to put on the menu. Malmaison’s head chef came to visit us to give us ideas but he left the choice up to us.“He then showed us how to make the dishes and we were shown around the professional kitchens which was so dferent compared to where we are used to cooking.“We had never made most of the dishes before and we also had to create options for dferent dietary requirements so it was a good taster of what a future career would be like.“It was pretty daunting cooking for that many people but it was exciting.”S pupil Kane Breen was part of the sales team.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"unpaid-work-32-year-old-following-house-disturbance","story":"A -year-old man has been ordered to carry out  hours unpaid work after causing a disturbance outside a Hawick house.David Embleton of no fixed abode, but normally resides in County Durham, pleaded guilty to shouting and swearing in Northcote Street on January  and refusing to desist when requested to do so by police officers.Jedburgh Sherf Court was told that Embleton had been invited to stay at the house but the householder changed his mind and requested police assistance to get him to leave.Police arrived and Embleton was told not to go back to the address but two hours later was found in the stairwell of the property.Claire Nicholls, prosecuting, said he was asked to leave but became belligerent towards police officers."},{"url":null,"title":"hunt-scotlands-next-young-garden-designer","story":"KEEP Scotland Beautul is searching for children and young people in the Borders to take part in the countrys fth annual Pocket Garden Competition.The competition challenges youngsters to design a garden which could be chosen to be displayed at Gardening Scotland in the summer.Schools in the Borders are invited to take part and design a garden featuring one of the competitions themes for  Wildle Gardening, One Planet Picnic, Keep Scotland Beautulrsquos th birthday or the Year of Coasts and Waters .The more creative and unique the garden, the better.

Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford.

This was designed to finish the job, ensuring everyone heard it from the horsersquos mouth, not on the rumour mill, and more than a little self-indulgently I admit, as catharsis after  years too many of trying to ensure no one would ever know.I touched the lsquopostrsquo key, threw my eyes shut as adrenaline, dread and relief filled me, then slowly opened them to assess the damage from the G-Bomb I had dropped. I anticipated that it would garner attention and elicit praise from my young, liberal peers, but I hadnrsquot realised the response would explode like a giant confetti canon at Pride.It turns out a lot of people are refreshing Facebook at three in the afternoon at the beginning of February. With  likes, a thread of congratulatory comments a mile long and an inbox inundated with more heartfelt messages expressing the same, I was overwhelmed, overjoyed, and filled with exactly the love and support I needed to close the door behind me for good on the ghastly closet and get on with living. I even received a hand-written letter from a university friend. I still have it somewhere.A few weeks later, a straight guy at university with whom Irsquod rarely spoken made a point of telling me he was so moved by my coming-out post, made four years ago tomorrow, he was punching the air at his desk. I was incredibly touched as I set about navigating the dating scene as a gay man for the first time, keen as I was not to waste any more time. Because I did feel dreadfully behind my friends, something I later learned I was wrong about. That misconception is a common feeling, gay or straight.Coming out is a journey, and itrsquos one children begin to undertake from a young age and face alone. Before I could feel the slightest attraction for anyone, I was immersed in a society where all around the message is that opposite sexes attract. Before you can even conceive of coming out, you realise yoursquore not how yoursquore ldquosupposed to be and walk unknowingly into the closet where it feels safest. Everyonersquos experience is dferent, but there are certain commonalities.Some are most particularly afraid of how their friends will react, while often itrsquos family. Catholicism is part of my family fabric, and I worried about how readily my parents would go through the cognitive gymnastics often needed to reconcile the two. While my family is English on one side and American on the other, the reality is most families in Scotland have a religious influence, practicing or not, that helps inform instinctive attitudes on the transgression from ldquothe norm that is being LGBT.Eventually I realised that just as it was a journey for me in learning to embrace and love my gay self, so too is it a journey for our parents, wider family and friends. My parents, Paul and Lisa, had concerns my le would be harder, focussing on my welfare, particularly in those first few weeks while at university after breaking the news on Facebook. At the same time they could at last begin to reimagine how the future would play out.For many families, having an LGBT member does not fit in neatly with their hope of appearing at once perfect and ndash rather contradictorily ndash normal. The gossip at the school gates far outlives a parentrsquos years standing at them, and many bend over backwards to keep up appearances. But the picture painted in programmes such as Modern Family, with its gay members, interracial marriages, orce, and adoption has long been much closer to reality.But sexuality is far from the only area in which notional normality eludes us, or at the very least, eluded me. This next anecdote forms a key part of the emotional roller-coaster that was that immediate post-coming-out period but I havenrsquot previously shared it beyond a few friends.On a trip to China in the summer that year, I hosted a party in my hotel room at a remote conference venue for the British, American and Canadian students I was with on the first night of a week-long stay.After everyone  had left the room, I found myself alone inside with a male student Irsquod met that day but had barely spoken to. He crossed the room towards me and began kissing me. He pushed me on to my bed and lay on top of me. I told him to stop, thinking an unambiguous message was needed. Whenever he freed my mouth to breathe, I eked out a ldquostop. Sometimes I alternated it with ldquoplease stop, asmanners could charm me out of the situation.I pushed upwards to no avail. I was never going to be able to bench press his body weight. Not least when I was so drunk. As I realised how defenceless I was, and he moved to undress me, I knew the fear so many people, predominantly women, have experienced before me.As his weight on me eased for an instant, I slipped out from under him, ran for the door and collapsed in the hallway as it shut behind me.ldquoWhat happened  an American boy who was still outside said to me.ldquoNothing, I said panting.ldquoThat did not look like nothing. The words hung in the air as I let them go unanswered.For six days none of us left the complex as there was nowhere to go. The attackerhad the good grace not to come to the next party the following night.A week later in central Beijing, we all went clubbing to celebrate his birthday.I dredge up this memory because the simple and happy story of a boy who came out to rapturous applause was only ever going to be part of that tale. I do not know what form othersrsquo earliest sexual experiences take, but I would imagine a greater number resemble mine than they do a Disney fairy tale. But I could be wrong. Sadly I think most parents and grandparents know very little about what is really going on in their young loved onesrsquo lives.So where do we go from here It is our shared moral imperative to fathom othersrsquo experiences of the world and to be amongst those dragging society forwards. Irsquom under no illusion that the average Scot reading this is free of all misgivings about having a child who is LGBT. But all LGBT children will be highly perceptive to any commentary on these issues. The passing comments. Do you remember everything you said out loud about gay marriage legislation when that was debated  From the comfort of your living room, how do you react when gay characters or gay kiss scenes appear on TV shows It is not acceptable to assume a child is or will be straight. Firstly because we all know the fact is that not everybody is straight. In a  YouGov survey, % of respondents placed themselves somewhere other than zero on a scale of zero to six where zero is exclusively heterosexual and six is exclusively homosexual. Among --year-olds it was half.The conclusion I draw from this and the age group discrepancy is that far more people are LGBT, possibly bisexual, than they let on and certainly than older generations are prepared to acknowledge about themselves.When half of young people surveyed say they arenrsquot entirely straight, basic maths says itrsquos time to stop assuming your children or grandchildren are straight.But beyond this it is incumbent upon every one of us to embrace the likelihood of gay, bi or trans loved ones, whatever personal feelings one might have, because of the occurrence of mental illness amongst LGBT people, particularly in the closet, which I can only call an epidemic. Nine in ten young trans people have thought about killing themselves and % have self-harmed at least once. That isnrsquot an alarm bell you hear ringing itrsquos an air-raid siren.A key catalyst for my coming out was the realisation my past bouts of depression would most likely only recur with increasing duration and depth possibly one day ending in suicideI didnrsquot. The decision was made.What comes next after that decision certainly doesnrsquot go as well as hoped for everyone, with a quarter of homeless young people being LGBT. Far more progress is needed to eradicate the rejection LGBT people face from their families.While in the legal context we have made great strides since the Stonewall uprising of  and the social movements of that era, these statistics make me despair at my straight peersrsquo complacency, seeing our more liberal generation and gay marriage and appearing to think wersquove pretty much arrived at the society we need to build.When talking in the office about the cover photoshoot for this piece, one gay colleague older than me made a point of saying how much he admires my openness in talking at work about being gay. I was very appreciative, but it reminded me that while my generation is likely the most consistently visible and outspoken, we stand on the shoulders of generations whose struggles were far greater than young LGBT people in the West today will ever know on a societal level.As recently as , people in Britain were arrested and convicted for having gay sex, the cornerstone of any gay rights. A group of men, the Bolton Seven, were convicted under the Sexual Offences Act , since only sex between two men ndash not three or more ndash had been legalised in England and Wales in . But Scotland did not even see that most basic change until .Thankfully Scotlandrsquos slow start to LGBT liberation was turned around when around  it gained attention worldwide for having the ldquogayest parliament and party leaders of any country.In researching Britainrsquos march away from rampant and state-sanctioned homophobia, two quotes stood out for me. At the Conservative Party conference in , prime minister Margaret Thatcher said: ldquoChildren who need to be taught traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay.One year later she brought in legislation that would deny a generation of LGBT children any form of recognition that their sexuality or gender identity was valid at school in their most formative years. After the removal of ldquosodomy laws, this was two steps forward, one step back.Then in  the Supreme Court ruled two gay men from Cameroon and Iran had a right to asylum in the UK. With striking echoes of Thatcherrsquos language  years earlier, Lord Hope instead said reading the judgement: ldquoTo compel a homosexual person to pretend that their sexuality does not exist or suppress the behaviour by which to manest itself is to deny him the fundamental right to be who he is.Real change does happen. We have seen it in our own letimes as we see it in these quotes. But it is not handed to us. Queer history is a story of fighting for our rights, in courts and in the streets. Pride is one such protest, and the LGBT community must continue to question the genuineness of companies all too keen to exploit our struggle and achievements as an opportunity for virtue-signal advertising.And just as the movements of the th century began with trans women of colour, white gay men like me must remember the raised status we have won is worth nought without trans and minority ethnic members of our community seeing those gains.It is just as important, though, that the fight takes place in the home ndash for those who feel able ndash and at the pub, club and office desk ndash calling out our friends and families for the small indignities and inequities which chip away at that fundamental right to exist and holding them to the highest standards we deserve, not just for our own sake but for that of their future children, nieces and nephews too.One challenge on the road to coming out is letting go of the safety and unquestioned esteem of straightness. But it is a safety and esteem maintained through exhausting pretence and denial.In doing the cover photoshoot for this story, we used nakedness to recreate some of the vulnerability of that Facebook post and place it alongside a stoic pride. Buta vulnerability is perceived, it was scarcely felt in that moment. For all the energy once spent trying to be straight, I wouldnrsquot swap being gay for love nor money.Four years out, Irsquove had one loving boyfriend, introduced him to my family, dated, taken up sports, earned two degrees, and at my auntrsquos invitation I hope to go over for New York Pride this summer. A bit further along in my journalism career I want to marry and adopt children. In other words, at this point in time, Irsquom exactly where I want to be."},{"url":null,"title":"public-given-chance-embroider-scotlands-great-tapestry","story":"Now the public is being offered the chance to contribute to the Great Tapestry Of Scotlandrsquos welcome  that will be displayed at the artworkrsquos new home.Following a welcome tour that will take in Aberdeen, Glasgow and the Borders, the tapestry will be permanently housed in a purpose-built pound. million interactive visitor centre in the town of Galashiels, the former heart of Scotlandrsquos woollen textile industry.Those who add a stitch to the Welcome To Scotlandrsquos Story , with the help of some of the countryrsquos leading textile artists, will havetheir names enshrined in history asa contributor to the visitor centre, opening in .The Great Tapestry Of Scotland: Welcome Panel Tour will visit historic Scottish properties, cultural venues, care homes and other venues that promote social inclusion.Sandy Maxwell-Forbes, Great Tapestry Of Scotland Centre director, said: ldquoTelling the peoplersquos story of Scotland and making this story accessible to everyone has always been at the heartof the Great Tapestry Of Scotland, so wersquore incredibly excited to be giving those who live in Scotland, and those visitors who love our country so much, an opportunity to stitch their name in Scotlandrsquos history through our new Welcome Panel Tour.ldquoWe would like to thank all the venues and event organisers who are making this possible.ldquoIn keeping with the Great Tapestry Of Scotlandrsquos ethos, it is vital that as many people as possible have an opportunity to contribute to the .

We just live in a very touch-deprived society. Itrsquos just awful.ldquoYou see people after theyrsquove hadlots of touch and theyrsquore really peaceful, content and happy and they lose the jaggedness that lots of people have.As a lawyer for more than  years before retiring last May to focus on his therapy work, Mr Fraser dealt with countless acrimonious orces and saw first-hand the effects of touch and affection deprivation.He said: ldquoOne of the things cuddle parties try and do is break the unfortunate connection that people have got with affectionate touch and sexual touch, with the consequence that people are simultaneously over-sexualised and touch deprived.As adults, who do we get touch from, he asks, especially without demand. One cuddle party-goer who was only ever touched when her husband wanted physical intimacy and received no affectionate contact was ldquoessentially starved of touch.Mr Fraser said: ldquoComing to the cuddle parties enabled her to experience affectionate, consensual touch with no sexual agenda.A hug that lasts for  seconds releases the hormone oxytocin, known as the cuddle or love hormone, which can lower blood pressure, slow heart rates and improve mood.Researchers have found that the same areas of the brain that respond positively to gentle touch also help to develop a sense of body ownership, or what Mr Fraser calls ldquoembodiment, the sense of inhabiting onersquos own body and setting healthy boundaries.The first cuddle party was held in  in the United States and soon migrated to British shores where the y started with regular events in London, facilitated by Ms Sonnenbaum.She said: ldquoA cuddle party is a way to ask for and receive loving touch in a safe non-sexual setting. This helps with finding out about our own touch preferences and communicating about them effectively without fear of being judged or rejected.ldquoWe practise saying both lsquoyesrsquo and lsquonorsquo confidently to each other. Strong personal boundaries and the ability to say lsquonorsquo are the prerequisite for letting people come close to us ndash or  this wouldnrsquot feel safe.She added: ldquoWith the rise of one-person households in big cities people donrsquot get a lot of touch which is non-sexual and my suspicion is that people have casual sex just to satisfy their skin hunger.Mr Fraser said: ldquoPeople have said things like, lsquothis is my worst nightmarersquo. But itrsquos only touch that you wish to receive ndashyou donrsquot want to get hugged by somebody, you donrsquot get hugged by them.ldquoThis is the opposite of being indiscriminately touched by other people. Itrsquos reprogramming people and itrsquos empowering people.Consent is vital and never more so than in the post #MeToo era when even consensual physical intimacy can be shadowed by fears of accusation and abuse.Mr Fraser said: ldquoThe traditional idea of consent is a bit like an army besieging a castle and the people inside surrender and open the doors and then the army can come in and do whatever they like. You agree to something and then yoursquove got to just accept whatever follows. Our idea of consent is entirely dferent ndash itrsquos based on enthusiastic consent in the moment.The importance of being able to say no to touch of any kind canrsquot be underestimated, said Mr Fraser. He added: ldquoIf a person canrsquot say no then they and the person in contact with them are both fundamentally unsafe. You have to have clarity because itrsquos onlyyou have a no that your yes means something.lEveryBody Loves Cuddle Party Workshop, CCA Glasgow, Sunday February , pm-pm."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-macneil-phrase-coin-grammar-drama","story":"First, as I understand it, many of you are worried about the economy. To some, this is such a dficult subject that economists themselves always get it wrong .But the economy is perfectly simple. Herersquos how it works. Somebody makes things. Somebody buys things. We all live happily ever after. Irsquom sure you can grasp the gist.However, in order to buy things, one must have coinage. And, even though much of this is now electronic or virtual, clunky coins in the hand or pocket seem fittingly symbolic to celebrate the past that we are now about to enter.Accordingly, a p commemorative Brexit Day coin has been issued. A harmless gesture, you might think, in normal times. But these are not normal times. People have become unhinged. A coin has been issued, and they have gone doolally.Opponents of Brexit ndash people with a passionate interest in trade agreements ndash have reacted with uncharacteristic extremism and irrationality, some even threatening to decorate the coins withswastikas ndash yup ndash this referring to the historical fact that the Nazis once held a democratic referendum to find outGermanyrsquos citizens wanted to invade Europe.Among those exercised disproportionately is fantasy author Sir Philip Pullman, who called for a boycott of the coin on the grounds that the rubric was allegedly ungrammatical. He lamented, in particular, the lack of a so-called Oxford comma after ldquoprosperity in the words ldquoPeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations.What an interesting and surely well-meant phrase. Who coined it, as it were, originally  Was it Hitler  At any rate, the grammar Gestapo goose-stepped all over it though, soon, a Resistance sprang up, arguing that the comma was purely optional and even ndash look away now, Martha ndash an Americanism, presumably being named after the famous university city there.Nothing is simple any more. Although a simple man myself, I was ndash seriously ndash once accused in a bookof knowing what an Oxford comma was, but it turns out that I did not.I thought it separated phrases. Thus,I write, ldquoIt was blue and hellip, without a comma after ldquoblue, the expectation is that more description of ldquoIt will be forthcoming. However,Irsquom intending to say, ldquoIt was blue, and I wanted one, the comma is neededso as not to lead people up a garden path that promises more adjectives but doesnrsquot deliver. Similarly, yoursquoll see that, earlier, I bunged in a comma when saying: ldquoA coin has been issued, and they have gone doolally. Thatrsquos because, without the comma, the expectation is of more verbiage about the coin, whereas the subject has now changed . Drsquoyou see Most people donrsquot do this and, as a bit of a grammar stormtrooper myself, that irritates me, though not intensely. At any rate, thatrsquos what I thought an Oxford comma was, and I donrsquot see anyway why a commq is necessary in lists such as ldquopeace, prosperity and friendship. Using it to separate the last and penultimate items serves no purpose.But, truthfully, I donrsquot have a clue about such stuff. I just sound sentences in my head and shove in punctuation where I detect a hellip pause. At the end of the day, all thatrsquos required is that you make your meaning luculent.One wonders what Sir Philip would have made of the rubric on the old threepenny bit which read: ldquo+Elizabeth.II.Dei.Gratia.Regina.F:D: Latin  Itrsquos all Greek to me.In the meantime, perhaps he could spend his unwanted coinage in the new p lavatories at Drumnadrochit. At least there, he would know that his colon was in the right place.++++IN these dystopian times, I live by the motto: ldquotwo wheels bad, two legs good. I might also make a casefor: ldquotwo wheels bad, four wheels good. At the time of going to press, I cannot find anything particularly meaningful in ldquotwo wheels bad, four feet good.However, perhaps dogs might find it useful. At any rate, yoursquoll notice the common denominator in each motto: ldquotwo wheels bad. Hitherto, this has applied only to cyclists, those narcissistic bullies who cause danger to pedestrians and motorists alike.However, they could soon have an ally in other equally irresponsible road-users: to wit, hooligans gadding about on E-scooters.The British Government will shortly hold a consultation on allowing these satanic conveyances on roads used by normal people, despite warnings from abroad that the result will be ldquoanarchy.In France and Germany, E-scooter users have been accused, as with cyclists here, of ruining green or scenic footpaths. They also share with cyclists a predilection for pavements.George Orwell wrote about ldquoold maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the early morning mist. That was bad enough. Think how much worse it would bethe old louts were on E-scooters.++++AS someone who dislikes controversy, Irsquom not going to comment specically on the Mystery of the Alastair Stewart Tweet. The ITN newsreaderrsquos communication was allegedly racist, evenall indications suggest otherwise.Some perspective: As noted previously, the original equality campaigners were good, enlightened iniduals slowly, they gained the ascendancy and, for a while, all was well then the original ideals were twisted back on themselves and are now misused to damage innocent parties.However, this third stage has gone on a while now. In the s, I wrote in my local paper about a menace who drove about the town in the wee smarsquo hours waking people up with his street-cleaning machine.My description of himincluded, inter-alia, the observation that he was black-haired, which caused his union branch to raise the possibility that this was racist.A few years later, I confronted some clots about their incompetence, saying the job would have been better carried out by chimpanzees at the zoo. Whereupon, they pointed out that one of their number was of mixed-race. Cue jaw hitting floor. Why make such a connection Lesson: many people become so obsessed with racism that they become racist.++++OFFERED a choice of carrot or stick most Earthlings would opt for the former. The stick breeds resentment, the carrot happiness, and the happy learner scores higher than the resentful one.This has been proven in a study of , American children by Brigham Young University. Dr Paul Caldarella found that pupils in classes with the highest praise-to-reprimand ratio paid attention  to  per cent longer than those where scolding was prevalent.That said, my feeling is that humiliation and shame are better weapons in the battle to educate the nationrsquos nippers.True, it would breed resentment in many. However, it worked for me. A shy child, I blushed madly whenever I was the centre of attention, prompting the other inmates to point at me and shout: ldquoBeamer!Accordingly, I figured the way to avoid this persecution was to get things right. I was shamed, effectively, into becoming the knowledgable and wise figure you see before you today.Spare the rod and spoil the child was always poppycock. The correct formula is shame the child and watch it learn. The probability that, outside school, it will smash windows and pee on cars is beyond the scope of this discussion.Read more: Pullman calls for boycott of Brexit p over missing Oxford comma"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-let-us-hang-eu-values-respect-compassion","story":"July .

Whats next John Edward, Edinburgh EH.MOST of the rest of the world is now convinced that the average Brit is not too bright. The real impact of Brexit will not be felt for over a year and will almost certainly result in the withdrawal of foreign car plants and the collapse of our native car industry. Food will certainly rise in price, along with all imports. Our farming and fishing industries will suffer, but since they all voted Leave, they only have themselves to blameThe main problem for the rest of us is high unemployment, combined with low paid and insecure jobs. The Government consists of mainly multi-millionaires who have prudently transferred their main assets offshore. They plan on making a killing out of a low-wage, low-security workforce and will keep benefits low so that many will live at the poverty level.The future is less bright than the Brexiters would have you believe and this, combined with the ongoing slow but sure dismantling of our NHS, will ensure a poor and fairly short-lived workforce who have no rights and little say in events, but who have taken back control and now have their own sovereignty.James Evans, Dumbarton.ldquoWHO do you think you are kidding, Mr Johnson,If you think old Englandrsquos won Kenneth Fraser, St Andrews.LET me get this right, John Edgarclearly wants an independent Scotland to join the European Union.

The whole exercise was to make rail as opposed to car the attractive option, particularly for commuters.It builds upon the expansions since the late s starting with Edinburgh-Bathgate, and the extension to Larkhall, through Stirling-Alloa, Laurencekirk and Conan Bridge stations, the extension to Galashiels and Tweedbank, and most recently Robroyston.But even with the forthcoming promised new stations at East Linton, Reston, Leven and Cameron Bridge, that still leaves much of Scotland marooned from the railway.Suggested extensions, not all on old routes, include: Comrie via Crieff and Forfar to Laurencekirk, Dumfries to Stranraer including branches to Kirkcudbright and Cairnryan, and Aberdeen-Banchory. These could really open up the country, for commuters and tourists alike.But it is not just a matter of new stations or laying new track. Trains have to run frequently enough to attract motorists, so while a headway of  minutes is sufficient for a journey of  miles, a  minute frequency is needed for those less than  miles.Junction improvements such as at Bellgrove and Portobello, plus capacity enhancements and speed improvements, e.g. Perth-Inverness, Kilmarnock-Dumfries and Edinburgh-Tweedbank, are required, and the electrication programme, already well behind and such that the  target looks exceedingly unlikely to be met, needs to be doubled, to include the Fe Circle and the Borders to Tweedbank, rather than just connecting the Seven Cities.It is an ambitious scheme and will clearly take many years to achieve. However it is the only way of achieving a step change of the magnitude required by the looming climate change that will enable people to travel around Scotland without causing excessive damage to the environment.Roderick McDougall and Railfuture Scotland have proposed a bold solution it remains to be seen whether the powers-that-be will rise to the challenge.bull Jane Ann Liston is secretary of Railfuture Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-power-pandemic","story":"THE outbreak of the coronavirus in China poses one huge and terrying question: are we heading for a full-scale pandemic The World Health Organisation has declared the outbreak a global emergency, and the coronavirus has already come to the UK.So far, there have been nearly , cases in China with at least  deaths. The virus has spread across the Far East, and made it to France, America, Canada, India and Finland.Pandemics ndash defined as diseases which spread rapidly over a large area of the planet ndash arenrsquot just killers which claim the lives of millions. The death toll, the panic, and the grief unleashed by pandemics fundamentally reshape the societies they ravage.Our best modern example is HIV Aids which has killed around  million people worldwide. The disease reshaped how the world talked about sex, and caused a revolution in medicine. Cholera brought about advancements in public sanitation.Here we look at some of the most virulent outbreaks in human history, and unravel why they happened, and how they changed the face of history, society and culture.The plague of AthensThe history of the Western world would have been very dferentit werenrsquot for an outbreak that turned the city of ancient Athens into the set of an apocalyptic horror movie.To the ancient Greeks, the Peloponnesian War between Athens, the seat of democracy, and the militaristic state of Sparta, was the equivalent of the First World War. It was a titanic struggle between two superpowers and it engulfed the entire Greek world.When the war began in BC, the Athenians, a naval power, knew they would be outmatched on land against the fabled Spartan army. So under the command of their famed leader Pericles, the people retreated within the walls of the city. The plan was to allow the Athenian fleet to grind down the Spartans.The city was overcrowded with refugees from the countryside, and supplies were flooding in from across the Mediterranean to the Athenian port of Piraeus to keep the people fed.In BC, a ldquoplague ship ndash carrying probably either typhoid or typhus ndash entered Piraeus unbeknown to the port authorities. Soon , people would be dead ndash at least one-quarter of the cityrsquos population.Chaos broke out in the city. The ancient historian Thucydides wrote in his History of the Peloponnesian War: ldquoThe catastrophe was so overwhelming that men, not knowing what would happen next to them, became indferent to every rule of religion and law.The rich blew their money before they died. The sick were left unattended for fear of contagion. The bodies piled up. The people believed the Gods had abandoned them. Nobody was safe. Pericles himself died, leaving the Athenians rudderless. The plague ed twice more. Spartans watched while disease destroyed their enemies.Sparta was eventually victorious, and the Athenian empire entered terminal decline ndash with it, democracy would soon be stled. Who knows how the future of Europe might have been shapedplague had not come to Athens, and it was democracy which triumphed over Sparta.The Antonine plagueIt was early globalisation which turned the Roman Empire of the second century into a mass graveyard. Romersquos troops were besieging the Mesopotamian city of Seleucia, now found in modern Iraq, in AD when illness began to sweep through the ranks. Roman legions were made up of soldiers recruited from across an empire which spread from Hadrianrsquos Wall to Syria.Troops ing from Seleucia to their homelands brought the illness with them. Itrsquos thought the plague was smallpox. In Rome, the plague was killing , people a day. One in four people died in the city, and across other areas the mortality rate was one in three.The entire world had a population of around  million at this point. Itrsquos thought that the plague claimed five million lives in Europe and the near east. The plague may even have spread to China.The outbreak claimed the le of Emperor Lucius Verus. He had co-ruled with Marcus Aurelius Antoninus ndash who had the misfortune to find the plague named after him. The plague fatally weakened the Roman Empire, crippling the army, and disrupting trade and commerce.When the illness hit what is now Germany, it brought refugees fleeing the plague south, piling pressure on the borders of the empire. It would be ldquobarbarian tribes which eventually brought Rome to her knees.The virulence of the plague is thought to be down to the fact that this was the first major incursion of smallpox into Europe and inhabitants had zero resistance to the illness.A century later, from around AD, the Plague of Cyprian further exhausted the Roman Empire, also hastening its collapse. Named after St Cyprian, who witnessed the suffering, the outbreak seems to have begun in Carthage, in what is now modern Tunisia. Identication of that plague ranges from measles to ebola.At the time, early Christians were made scapegoats for the disease, and persecuted and murdered. At its height, the plague killed ,a day.The plague of JustinianBy the reign of Emperor Justinian, the western half of the Roman Empire had collapsed. Justinian ruled in the east from the Byzantine city of Constantinople. But Justinian was ambitious, and planned to reunite and rebuild the shattered superpower.However, in AD, the first recorded outbreak of bubonic plague ndash Yersinia pestis ndash threw the emperorrsquos plans into disarray. Constantinople became the epicentre of the outbreak.At its height, the plague was said to have killed , a day in Constantinople alone, and claimed up to % of the cityrsquos population. The plague could have killed up to  million people in total, during multiple bouts of recurrence. It is thought the disease came on grain ships, bearing rats that carried infected fleas, from Egypt.Agriculture broke down as farmers died and there was no-one to till fields and raise animals. The tax base collapsed as there werenrsquot enough people alive to fill treasury coffers. Expansionist tribes like the Goths and Lombards began claiming chunks of the old western empire as their own. Some believe that the plague hit Britain particularly hard and allowed for the success of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of England.The strain of bubonic plague which would devastate Europe in the s was a distant cousin, it is believed, of the plague which ravaged the reign of Justinian.The Black DeathBubonic plague has long been with us. Evidence of Yersinia pestis has been found in skeletons up to , years old. But never has the plague had such a profound effect on history as the toll wrought by the Black Death between  and .The plague swept from the Russian steppe and Persian gulf to the highlands of Scotland and north Africa. At the upper end of estimates, around  million people died. Europersquos population was cut by up to %, and about one-fth of the entire worldrsquos population was lost.The Black Death came down the trade route known as the Silk Road from China and then hopped on ships travelling the Mediterranean and throughout Europe. No other illness has so radically altered the course of humanity. It changed everything from culture to commerce, from economics to politics.In most major European cities about half the population died. Archaeologists are still discovering plague pits used for mass burials today.European culture was highly developed in the s, and writers and artists responded to the plague with works like The Decameron by the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio, which tells of a group of aristocrats who lock themselves up in a country villa to weather the duration of the plague. Works of art began to feature skulls and skeletons. Ordinary people joined the ranks of the Flagellants, who would beat themselves with ropes and chains in order to purge the sins which they believed had brought the plague down on them. In essence, society went mad.When the plague finally burned itself out on the land, Europe had been changed forever. With so many workers and peasants dead, survivors were able to demand much higher wages than before, severely weakening the feudal system, creating more social mobility and an emerging middle class. In England, such changes almost led to civil war in the clash known as the Peasantsrsquo Revolt.There have even been claims by academics that the sheer number of dead brought about a cooling of the climate. Less human activity and more free land led to reforestation, which some believe contributed to the Little Ice Age.Inevitably, in an age with little science, scapegoats were sought during the Black Death, and in Europe those blamed were the Jews. In Strasbourg in , , Jews were murdered. The same year the Jewish populations of Mainz and Cologne were exterminated. As a result, many Jews moved to Poland, where a large population built up, until the Second World War and the Nazi Holocaust.The Great Plague of London was the last major outbreak of bubonic plague to occur on the British Isles. It claimed , people, which was about one-quarter of the cityrsquos population, between  and .In September , the Great Fire of London devastated the city. Many still think that the inferno brought an end to the plague. However, most scientists believe the plague had all but run its course by the time fire struck.In the wake of the plague and the fire, London became the epicentre of a semi-Golden Age, with a flourishing of the arts and science as the city was rebuilt as a modern European capital.The third pandemicScience now refers to the events of  which began in China as The Third Pandemic. If the first pandemic was the Plague of Justinian, and the second was the Black Death, then the outbreak of plague centred on Asia and the Far East in the mid-th century is the third plague pandemic.At least  million people died in China and India alone, but nearly all parts of the world were affected. The plague spread to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, San Francisco, Australia, Russia, the Caribbean, and South America. Officially, the outbreak lasted until .There was even an outbreak in Glasgow in . It arrived in the Gorbals in August that year. Soon  were infected. Sixteen died. Rats were killed en masse in the city, even though it seems the infection in Glasgow was spread by human contact. Coins, trams and ferries were disinfected.Rapid industrialisation in China helped spread the virulent disease at its outbreak, as workers began moving across the country. This coincided with a period of social unrest which saw more movement of people ndash both troops and refugees ndash on a greater scale than before. In March , the plague killed , in Canton in just a few weeks.The plague soon spread to India where special measures were put in place to contain the outbreak by the British. Quarantine, isolation camps and travel restrictions were enforced by colonial soldiers. Indians found the conduct of Britain highly repressive and it helped fuel the desire for independence.Spanish fluThe th century took all the contributory factors to the worldrsquos previous pandemics and brought them together in one great confluence of bad luck and biology that became the Spanish flu pandemic of .War, globalisation, trade, transport ndash they all contributed to making Spanish flu, or the HN virus, the most deadly outbreak of the th century.The flu pandemic, which lasted until , killed up to  million people ndash around % of the worldrsquos population. Spanish flu claimed the lives of more people in  weeks than Aids killed in  years.More people died from Spanish flu than in the First World War, which had an estimated death toll of around  million.Science suggests that the possible epicentre of the outbreak was the Etaples military camp in France in . Up to , soldiers passed through the camp each day. There was a hospital there, as well as a farm with pigs and poultry. Both animals harbour flu viruses which can mutate and jump to humans.In the overcrowded conditions of the First World War, the contagion spread, moving among soldiers from dozens of countries. Thatrsquos when it went global, reaching even into the Arctic.During wartime, newspapers in Germany, America, France and Britain censored material on the outbreak to keep panic low and morale high. The neutral nation of Spain was free to report as it pleased, and so many thought the outbreak had hit the Spanish hardest ndash thus the flu pandemic acquired its name.With many soldiers badly debilitated by le in the trenches, the flu was able to claim many more victims than a ldquonormal flu. Spanish flu was made especially deadly as it hit out of winter season, was highly infectious and played havoc with the bodyrsquos immune system.Although most flus kill the very young, very old and very sick, the elderly were partially protected from Spanish flu. A previous influenza pandemic ndash known as Russian flu ndash which hit in  , gave older adults partial immunity to the  outbreak. So, in America, the vast majority of deaths were in the under- age range.Victims had a bad death. There were cases of bleeding from the ears, and most deaths were down to pneumonia. At least % of those infected died, whereas ldquonormal flu kills about .%.There have been theories that Spanish flu aided the victory of the allies, and even helped speed up womenrsquos rights, as so many victims were men. However, what it certainly did was set a template for what a modern pandemic looks like. It taught us that the one thing which imperils humanity is human activity. Transport, war, trade, travel ndash these are the things which the next great pandemic will exploit in order to spread and kill when it finally comes."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-neds-er-trousers-talking-politics-secret-passwords-ban-say","story":"I apologise for introducing a pooperous note to this lecture or article so early in proceedings.

In fact, a study carried out by the University of East Anglia into the result found that % voted Leave.Brexit appeals to voters in this area for several reasons.For some farmers, itrsquos a chance to improve upon the constraints of a \"one-size-fits-none\" Common Agricultural Policy.Some long-time independence supporters voted Leave because they saw little point in casting adrt from London only to remain anchored to Brussels.And, of course, there are those in our fishing communities who are desperate to escape the shackles of the Common Fisheries Policy, which has been disastrous for Scottish fleets.Many of those people voted Conservative in  and a greater number did so last December. I campaigned very strongly in the general election on \"getting Brexit sorted\" and moving forward as a country.In Scotland, the SNP took home another country-wide victory, claiming  seats out of its  on offer.It has been said many times before, but there are huge opportunities from leaving the EU. That gets lost too often in the endless negativity from SNP politicians.Last week was a case in point. The UK Fisheries Bill was presented to Parliament, detailing new powers on fisheries management for Scottish Ministers ndash powers which were specically asked for by the Scottish Government.However, the reaction from the SNP Fisheries Minister was to complain that Scotland would not be leading the UK-wide negotiations.There seems nothing that can happen at Westminster that cannot be turned into a point of grievance by the SNP. And of course, the Nationalists endlessly predict that there will be a \"sell-out\" of fisheries.The SNP would like nothing more than a UK \"betrayal\" of our fishermen just to score political points. They are only too happy to parrot the EU spin that fishing rights will be linked to financial services and bartered away.Unfortunately for the Nationalists, our Prime Minister and senior Ministers in the Cabinet like Aberdeen-born Michael Gove, are resolute that full UK control over access to our waters is a red line issue. And as of pm on Friday, under international law, the UK reclaimed its status as an independent coastal state.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"The EU flag replaces the Union flag in Brussels after Brexit\",\"description\": \"The EU flag replaces the Union flag in Brussels after Brexit\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media CdyttI poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests CdyttI.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Just like Norway, Iceland, The Faroe Islands, and indeed the EU itself, we will negotiate annually on reciprocal access and quota share.

Striking a good trade agreement with the EU and deals with other countries around the world will provide opportunities for other sectors of Scottish business ndash including our whisky industry.I understand that many who voted Remain are unhappy about leaving the EU, and that the SNP are using the  result to bolster the case for separation.But the last thing Scotland needs is more constitutional ision. There is no appetite among the Scottish public for \"indyref\" any time soon.Instead, it is time for us all to move on.:Iain Macwhirter: There wonrsquot be a legal and legitimate referendum next year or for many years after that. Get used to it\"Slowly but surely people will see they have been sold a pup. Prepare for buyerrsquos remorse\"Lord Foulkes, Labour peer, and former MP and government minister:I well recall the sense of euphoria in  when the British people confirmed our membership of what we then called the Common Market by a two-thirds majority. It was then mostly Tory governments that deepened our involvement with the Maastricht Treaty and the Single European Act.It seemed at times that only Bill Cash and thewanted us to leave as we prospered and developed as a leading member of one of the most successful economic unions ever.But resentment was growing within the Tory party, fuelled by myths of straight bananas and Brussels bureaucracy touted by journalists, including Boris Johnson.David Cameron, now seen as one of the most inept PMs ever, thought he could silence the critics within his party and motormouth Farage by holding a referendum. It was a monumental mistake.A lacklustre campaign by both the Government and the official Opposition gave the Brexiteers a victory of which they were as surprised as anyone. Corbyn must share the blame with Cameron.As a result there followed three years of confusion and disarray. Prime Ministers came and went, parties disintegrated and a damaging ision between Parliament and Government has soured our politics for years to come.The Tories were then gted a big majority by the foolish decision of Corbyn and Swinson to agree to an early election and a brilliant Tory campaign with the one simple message ndash ldquoGet Brexit Done ndash repeated incessantly.Opposition leaders failed to point out that the Tories had not managed to do this for three years and failed also to have a simple alternative message.We are now on a journey where no one knows the destination, least of all the Government.Already there is a growing awareness of the dangers ahead. The Archbishop of Canterbury prays and pleads for unity. Tory MPs see the looming dangers and are trying to share responsibility for any disasters caused.The ldquocelebrations in Parliament Square have been boycotted by all but the fanatics and, not just because of the lack of fireworks, are a damp squib.Slowly but surely people will see they have been sold a pup and ldquobuyerrsquos remorse will grow.Fisherman will realise they are not protected, tarfs and form-filling will bedevil trade, travel in Europe will get more dficult as guaranteed free health care is replaced by expensive insurance, British expats and EU immigrants in the UK will suffer continued uncertainty, and our economy will fall behind the rest of Europe.Already those of us who believe that withdrawal was a mistake are regrouping and preparing to campaign to re-join. The European Movement is mobilising. Young people in particular are eager to restore the opportunities they believe they have lost by our departure.When the reality of Brexit dawns, as the EU prospers and the UK declines, I believe the momentum for ourwill be unstoppable. I only hope I live to see the day.Far from being done, the dficult politics of Brexit may be just about to start.Alistair Carmichael, Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland:Our departure from the European Union on Friday night is not the end of the story but it is the start of a new and even more challenging chapter in the Brexit saga. The war may be over, but for those of us who still believe in a United Kingdom that is an easy trading partner with its European neighbours, there is still a peace to be won.It is dficult to see how, in the time available, any ldquodeal with the remaining EU members can be anything more than a mechanism for keeping us aligned with the rules and decisions of the Union we have just left.Last week in Brussels, the talk from civil servants in the UK Permanent Representativersquos office was all about ldquoDynamic Alignment. Their definition of this was less than clear, but it appeared to allow us to move in the future when the remaining  member states decided to move.In fact, alignment is about far more than trade rules and regulations. Staying close to our European neighbours in cultural and scientic projects is in all our interests. It is not something that can be limited to figures on a spreadsheet.Data protection is one small illustration of the challenges we face in negotiating a final deal with the EU. It underpins how we move information around the world ndash crucial for our increasingly digital economy. Securing a continuity deal on data with ongoing alignment is the right course to ensure continued growth. Even here, there are signs of frustration in Brussels as basic questions remain unanswered.If answers about something as technocratic as data protection are dficult, what hope is there when it comes to the really contentious subjects like fishing  Many in our fishing communities were persuaded to support Brexit as it would bring back control of our own waters. After decades of mismanagement under the Common Fisheries Policy you can see the attraction. Whether or not these promises are delivered is now down to sheer political will.We know that our former partners are not just going to walk away from fishing in UK waters and will want to exact a pricethey are to do so. Will Boris Johnson and his ministers be prepared to pay the price necessary to honour their own promises, or will they reach the same conclusion as their predecessors in the s, that fishing is ldquoexpendable Time will tell. The problem for the Prime Minister is that time is not on his side. The decision to insist on doing a deal or leaving without one by the end of this year looks like another example of the old Etonian self-belief that led David Cameron to land us in this mess in the first place.Commission officials will again enter the negotiations knowing that the UK team across the table have already handed them a major advantage. By the time Hogmanay comes around again, the choice is likely to be a deal that effectively keeps us aligned with the EU, or  to crash out without a deal at all.Far from being ldquodone, the dficult politics of Brexit may be just about to start."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-historic-windows-lost-pvc-replacements","story":"THEY are the work of master craftsmen who toiled long before the days when industrial production and lightweight synthetic materials became commonplace.But now it has been warned that the often unique windows of Scotlandrsquos listed buildings are disappearing fast, as councils nod through upgrades which see them ripped out and cast on the scrap heap.A study by heritage experts at Heriot-Watt University has claimed that local authorities across Scotland have a ldquoculture of consent when it comes to the most vulnerable features of the countryrsquos listed buildings.There are around , listed buildings in Scotland, and their status means certain features should be retained and not replaced, such as original fireplaces, slate roofs and even windows.But planning permission to remove and replace historic windows from listed buildings is being given at the same rate as for non-listed homes, with little regard for their protected status.While international and national heritage organisations have been working to promote the repairing and upgrading existing windows, in Scotland the decision takes place at a local level. Owners of listed buildings apply to their local authorityrsquos planning department for permission to remove windows, or other historic features of the building.The study looked at Glasgow and Edinburgh, and found that from  to , the number of listed building applications relating to windows in the capital increased steadily from  to , with an approval rate of almost %. In Scotlandrsquos largest city, which has the third-highest number of listed buildings of any council area, approvals rose by %.Dr Craig Kennedy, of Heriot-Wattrsquos Institute for Sustainable Building Design, said: ldquoWindow glass is often overlooked compared to other historically important building materials like stone, metal and timber.ldquoAs such it is most vulnerable to being replaced, and with that a listed building begins to lose its character and aesthetic.Kennedy added: ldquoThere is no dference in approval rates between listed and non-listed buildings ndash itrsquos around % across the board at the three councils. What struck us was the increase in approvals from  to . The number of applications related to windows in listed buildings almost doubled, as did the number of approvals. The approval rate rose to almost %.ldquoWe interviewed officers in planning departments across Scotland, and some in England. The story was the same everywhere ndash since , conservation officers have left the organisation and havenrsquot been replaced, planning departments are under-resourced and under pressure. The result is a culture of consent.Many of the windows in listed buildings pre-date the industrial manufacture of glass on a wide scale, meaning each pane is unique and carries imperfections which often enhances their appeal.They will often be sash or casement windows, wood-framed and moved through complicated weighted pulleys hidden in the walls which can be dficult to replace.These windows are usually replaced by PVC frames with modern glass, for a iety of reasons. Householders may believe they are more energy-efficient or cheaper than restoring older windows. However, timber windows are often a cheaper and more environmentally-friendly option.But Kennedy believes that a decision to allow the replacement of historic windows should only ever be taken as a last resort. He said: ldquoThe importance of retaining original windows cannot be overstated. They contain a wealth of information on historic practices and manufacturing techniques.ldquoNowadays we are used to the glass in windows being perfectly clear. Older windows often contain tiny bubbles, known as seeds, or curved striations that came from the crown glass method of glass-making.He added: ldquoThe replacement of historic windows must be seen as a last resort instead of a first choice. Our research shows that the efforts of heritage agencies to promote repair and upgrading of historic windows may have been ineffective. They should refocus efforts to ensure that this message reaches the local planners who are in charge of our architectural heritage. Wersquore concerned that, at the local level, nobody is advocating for historic buildings.The Heriot-Watt team developed its own software to conduct the survey, as each of the local authorities recorded window-related applications dferently, even within their own organisation.The team hopes heritage professionals across the UK will use its software to examine decisions affecting listed buildings in their own local authority, and determine the scale of historic feature loss on a national scale.Both Edinburgh and Glasgow city councils defended their record on protecting listed buildings, with Edinburgh planning convener Councillor Neil Gardiner saying: ldquoWersquore very lucky to be home to not one but two World Heritage Sites in the capital. As a planning authority, wersquore ultimately s of our historic built heritage, and our listed buildings guidance seeks to protect the character and aesthetic appeal of period properties in the city.ldquoWe recognise that windows are an important feature in the elevation of any building and are vital to the history and architectural integrity of all historic buildings. Not only that, but their replacement with dferent designs can seriously affect the historic and architectural character of a building. Thatrsquos why our guidance on window replacement in listed buildings in Edinburgh emphasises a general presumption against the removal of original timber windows. The repair and rehabilitation of original windows is preferred in terms of sustainability, as well as protecting historical character.A Glasgow City Council spokesman said that it was important to note replacing windows in unlisted buildings does not need planning permission outwith conservation areas, meaning that a direct comparison is impossible as this type of work is not recorded.He added: ldquoOur guidance requires that proposals for the replacement of an original window to listed buildings and properties in a conservation area should be accompanied by a statement to demonstrate that the original window is beyond repair to justy its replacement.A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotlandsaid: ldquoOur Managing Change guidance, which was created for planning authorities when making decisions, states that original or historic windows should be retained wherever possible. In the guidance, we highlight several ways to upgrade energy efficiency, including draught-proofing and secondary glazing. Our guidance states that original or historic sash windows should only be replaced when they are beyond reasonable repair. If replacement is required, the new windows should be as close a match to the original designs as possible."},{"url":null,"title":"many-hickory-memories-golfing-great-james-braid-remembered-special-tribute-tournament","story":"James Braid was a five-times Open Championship winner in the early years of the th century, who went on to design courses theof the UK, counting some of the most fabled fairways and greens among his creations.The man was behind the toughest holes at world-renowned courses such as the Kingrsquos and Queenrsquos at Gleneagles, Carnoustie in Angus, East Lothianrsquos Royal Musselburgh, the Highland links at Brora, Bruntsfield in Edinburgh, founded in , and the Championship course at Dalmahoy.And now the th anniversary of his birth is to be honoured with its very own open championship, played just as the great golfer would have known ndash with traditional hickory wood clubs, plus fours and bunnets.The James Braid th Anniversary Hickory Open will tee off on February , Braidrsquos birthday, and see players tackle the course using equipment from a bygone era which would seem archaic today but would have been the stock in trade of players in Braidrsquos time.Born in Earlsferry in Fe in , James Braid was a founder of the worldrsquos first Professional Golf Association and a member of the ldquoGreat Triumvirate of British golf, who along with Harry Vardon and JH Taylor dominated the Open Championship from  to .Said to be ldquothe shining example of the dference between the golfer and the hitter of golf balls, Braid was the first person to score under  at the tournament and was famed for his quiet courtesy on the course and sense of fair play.His  victory in the Open Championship was the last successful defence of the title by a European until Paacutedraig Harrington replicated the feat in . Dressed in a Tweed cap and Norfolk coat, always accompanied by a collar and tie, he cut a dignied figure, and his game was said to have only suffered from a relatively poor skill at putting. But when he switched to innovative aluminium-headed putters on hickory shafts, he is said to have become lethal on the greens, banishing his early problems completely.Yet while his golfing ability was said to be remarkable, it is his for eye for the architecture of golf for which many hold him in high esteem today.With his vast experience of tournament play and his understanding of design and construction, Braid set the standard in golf course design which the rest of the world would follow, inventing such features as the dog-leg hole and the pot bunker.During a career which stretched more than  years, he had a hand in designing around  courses, and helped revitalise many more. The total number is vague, but it is reckoned his influence can be found on  dferent courses in the UK, though a lelong dislike of travelling meant he never visited the US, and only one course in America was made to his specications, though he never visited it. As well as being one of the top tournament players of his day, Braid was a club professional at Walton Heath in Surrey, where he lived from  until his death in . The last course he designed was Creachmore in Stranraer, which opened shortly after his death.The James Braid Anniversary Open is the first match in a Scottish ldquohickory tour taking place throughout the year. The tour is the first time since the s a group of golfers have staged a multi-course competition using the sort of clubs and equipment professionals would take to the greens with before technology took a hold of the game from the s on.The tour will see the worldrsquos top  professionals and best  amateurs compete to qualy to participate in a final in October. Players will tee off at the Anniversary Open at Braid Hill in Edinburgh, and will also gather at the nearby Thistle Club, where Braid was a member in , at noon for a toast. Hickory golf has become increasingly popular in recent years, and the World Hickory Open Championship is staged in Scotland each year. Sandy Lyle, winner of the Open in  and US Masters Champion in , has won the event twice. The current champion is Swedish professional Johan Moberg.Playing a round using traditional equipment is said to require a greater degree of skill than modern clubs, as the ball cannot be hit as far or with the same accuracy.Boris Lietzow, organiser of the James Braid Open, runs Scotlandrsquos only specialist hickory golf shop, Jack White in Gullane, East Lothian. He said the tournament would be played in the same spirit as the game was in Braidrsquos day.Leitzow said: ldquoThe Scottish Hickory Tour has been created after a tournament culture in hickory golf has been established over the past  years by bodies such as the British Golf Collectorsrsquo Society, the Society of Hickory Golfers of America or the World Hickory Open Championship.ldquoThe vision is to create a circuit on which hickory golf is played to a high level by professionals and amateurs, and to play golf with wooden shafts brings the etiquette and style of the game in the s into the foreground. If hickory is played with vintage clubs, the carbon footprint of the equipment is zero, since it is based on % recycled material.He added: ldquoThe inaugural match of the Scottish Hickory Tour will not count into the tourrsquos points system, but is an anniversary celebration.ldquoIt is a social event in which about  players will participate, among them players from Switzerland and the United States, along with several professionals.Peter Stanbrook, captain of the James Braid Golfing Society, said: ldquoEven while he was winning tournaments, Braid turned his talents to golf course design. He originated classic courses and a number of lsquovillage gemsrsquo ndash smaller courses up and down the land which are known for being lsquothinking menrsquos golf coursesrsquo.ldquoHe developed this into a y and outstanding career, both originating courses and revising existing layouts. In all, nearly  courses have felt the benefit of his design expertise in some way. His legacy remains and he is up there with the very best of golf architects through the ages. To all of these achievements he added personal characteristics of charm, common sense and integrity. He was an enormously well-respected figure in th century British golf.Stanbrook added: ldquoSo, it is quite fitting to be remembering him and celebrating his legacy in , the th anniversary of his birth.ldquoI am delighted to see that the hickory golfers are undertaking this extended tour of golf courses with Braid connections.

There are a good range of candidates who are standing to be the deputy leader of the Labour party.Pressed on the point, he said: ldquoLook, Ian is a very, very competent candidate who is saying some interesting things, whether itrsquos around the Scottish constitutional question, where the Labour party needs to be, the need for a long-term vision.ldquoBut the other candidates are also setting out their stall as well, so Irsquom not going to come out and publicly back one candidate or the other.Asked why not, given Mr Murray was his only MP in Scotland and was standing to represent Scotland better inside the party, Mr Leonard said: ldquoIrsquom not going to make a public declaration about which candidate for leader or which candidate for deputy leader Irsquom backing, because I will need to work with whoever is elected.Pressed yet again, Mr Leonard said: ldquoIn the end itrsquos a political choice for members of the Labour party to make across the whole of the UK and they will exercise that right and make that choice about who they think is the best leadership team to help lead us towards the next general election.A source close to Mr Murray said: ldquoIan has entered the deputy leadership race to ensure Scotlandrsquos voice is amplied and the issues in Scotland are well understood by all. Thatrsquos why he has already gained the support of the majority of CLPs in Scotland that have nominated. Hersquos doing all he can to try and help the Labour Party in Scotland so that should be welcomed by Richard.Mr Leonard also restated his position, first set out in the general election, that an SNP majority in the  Holyrood election would justy a second independence referendum.Asked about Scotlands biggest public sector union, Unison, voting on Saturday in support of Holyrood having the power to call Indyref when it wanted, Mr Leonard said it showed some people had been \"driven to despair\" by the Tories.:Iain Macwhirter: There wonrsquot be a legal and legitimate referendum next year or for many years after that. Get used to itUnison Scotland said it would now promote the issue at the STUC congress in April.The motion put to members stated Unison \"supports the call for a second referendum, at a time to be determined by the Scottish Parliament, by means of either a section  order or an amendment to the Scotland Act as a satisfactory means of transferring the power over independence referendums\".Mr Leonard said: ldquoI understand completely, given the prospect of five more years of a Boris Johnson government, why some people are driven to anger and some people are driven to despair.ldquoSo I understand and we will listen to Unison, who are an important part not just of the Labour movement but of the Labour party.ldquoWe will listen to the reasons why their members... reached that conclusion.ldquoBut Irsquom bound to say that the prospectus for independence put forward by the SNP and their Growth Commission report is one fo a very hard dose of austerity which would lead to cuts in public services that Unison and other public sector trade union members work in.ldquoEven among those people who support independence, there is very little appetite for a referendum to be called in the very near future.He admitted that Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the UK Labour leadership race, had not consulted him before giving his personal position on Indyref last week.The Shadow Brexit Secretary had said an SNP majority win in the  Holyrood election would constitute a mandate for another vote.Mr Leonard said: ldquoIt shouldnrsquot be for the politicians from other parts of the UK to pronounce on these issue,.

The Calcutta Cup has always been one of my favourite events in the sporting calendar.And I admit there are few experiences so guaranteed to make me fill with emotion as that moment when the pipers fall silent and the Murrayfield crowd continue unaccompanied with ‘Flower of Scotland’.For  minutes England are the Auld Enemy and the taste of victory, on those occasions when we have it, is sweet. But it is a game. A game that I love, but a game nonetheless.And the rivalry is entirely about who will prove to have the more accomplished experience on the day. It is also the only time when I will wear national colours or consider waving a flag. Any flag.Don’t get me wrong there are occasions – like when I saw it fluttering in the breeze over the Church of Scotland in Jerusalem – when the sight of the Saltire fills me pride.And walking down Whitehall I get a huge sense of security from the Union Flag above parliament.: Brexit: EU flag will fly at Holyrood after Brexit, after government overturns decision of impartial parliament body: Why Scotland is still perfectly entitled to fly the Flag of Europe – John McLellanBut I have also come to resent the way in which flags have somehow become not just central to the political debate but regarded as central to what politics is about. I cannot see that.I care much more about tackling the homelessness that I see every day, even in the entrance to the parliament of the fth largest economy in the world.Or cleaning up the air that makes Edinburgh the most polluted city in Scotland and is now so dirty that a recent report estimated one in  deaths in our city is in some way attributable to it. And then there are the problems in our schools, our NHS, our public services and the sickening growth in food banks.Flag-waving doesn’t solve problemsNone of those issues will be resolved by waving a flag. Nor by wrapping ourselves in it and claiming that it somehow makes us more Scottish or British with an enhanced right to speak for the rest of us.They are not the preserve of any single political party, or to be used by them for narrow self-promoting purposes.Over the course of the past few years, I have begun to feel the same sense of attachment to the flag of the European Union as those of Scotland and the UK.But, unfortunately, that is also now being drawn into the political mud-slinging.For more than a decade, it has been flown proudly among the flags above the entrance to the Scottish Parliament. That flag represents a body which is now, sadly, no longer part of our constitutional framework. We are not entitled to either its protection or its patronage.And to that extent, the flag of the EU is no more relevant to our lives now than the flags of the United States, France, Germany, Japan or any other nation.Believe me, that is something which fills me with a huge sense of regret.I and my party, the Liberal Democrats, dedicated every possible moment we could, took every opportunity available and followed every route open to us to keep us in the European Union.In the end, we couldn’t and so it is no longer our flag to wave. I imagineScotland had voted to leave the UK in  many of us would have found ourselves in the same situation with the Union Flag.Union Jacks after independence And , for example, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Highland or any other local authority chose to continue to fly it above their headquarters or for that matter a pro-UK political party in administration at Holyrood in future raised it above parliament, there would be an outcry from the nationalists.Which is why I find the current attack on the corporate body of the Scottish Parliament and, for that matter, the Liberal Democrats so offensive.My colleague Liam McArthur MSP reminded the Scottish Parliament this week that the flying of the EU flag was a reflection of our membership of the EU and removing it does not make us anti-European as leaving it up would not make us pro-European.The flag is, he said, “a statement of legal fact and not a political desire”. But the latter is exactly what it is being usurped for. A political move designed to fan the flames of a particular desire by one party to promote its own agenda. That is not what I believe my parliament, or its flags, are for.They are there to represent the people of Scotland, regardless of their politics, religion or any other inidual factor.And, above all , they are a symbol of the sources from which the Parliament takes its authority. Those are now only the UK and the people of Scotland.I do not want to see the flag of the EU removed, that single act would represent everything I and so many other people have worked so hard not to lose. But I accept that it should be.Our attention now should be on working for the best possible relationship with our neighbours for the good of us all.And let’s keep our flag waving to the sports arenas.Christine Jardine is the Liberal Democrat MP for Edinburgh West©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"insight eu expats sense of betrayal","story":"As Britain prepared for its raucous Brexit party Scotland#s European expats shared their feelings of loss, abandonment and anger with Dani Garavelli.Andrea Wieler Goodbrand remembers the first time she became aware of hostility towards her as a European living in the UK.“It was a few weeks before the EU referendum,” she says. “The campaign had passed me by because everyone I knew was going to vote Remain. But then I was out walking and I saw a Brexit stall and it really offended me. I said to my husband, Paul: ‘I am really upset now,’ and he said: ‘Why ’ and I answered, ‘Because this is about me.’“It was a big realisation for a white European. In the past people had always been benevolent to me. I was the quirky Swiss girl. And that’s completely unjustied. It’s disgraceful that my nationality meant I was treated more favourably. But that is the way it was.”Wieler Goodbrand is talking to me in the kitchen of her home in the south side of Glasgow where she lives with Paul – a Scot – and their two-year-old son. The UK is poised to leave the European Union after  years. The following day will be a festival of triumphalism: government buildings will be lit up in red, white and blue, Michael Gove will talk of his “relief and his delight”, and a digital clock will count down the minutes until the country “takes back control.”Some of this triumphalism will push its way north. A few dozen Leave voters will gather in Glasgow’s George Square to wave their Union Jacks and toast their new-found “freedom”.In Wieler Goodbrand’s flat, however – and where in Scotland, which voted  per cent to Remain – there is a visceral grief, not only for the EU as a political entity, but as a symbol of peace, tolerance and collaboration. Those who feel European to their core – those who come from immigrant stock and prefer their passports maroon and their borders open – are seeking catharsis.As the appointed hour draws near, some wag will co-opt the Duke of Wellington – Tory stalwart that he was – to the Remain cause by placing a pro-European cone on his head. The hashtag #LeaveALightOnForScotland will trend all day. Outside Holyrood, pipes will be played and candles lit.No-one, however, will be in greater need of solace than the new Scots: those Europeans who – like Wieler Goodbrand – have built their homes here and have spent almost three years in a state of uncertainty.These immigrants staked their futures on the UK, and yet their loyalty and investment is being disputed, not by the Scottish Government, which has consistently expressed its gratitude, but by Westminster, which controls their fate.Having to apply for “settled status” has been a source of humiliation. So too has seeing themselves portrayed as freeloaders when they have worked so hard to make a contribution.Few have worked harder to make a contribution than Wieler Goodbrand. Her homeland is not a member of the EU, but has a bilateral agreement granting freedom of movement. She moved to Scotland in , after five years in Italy, to do a master’s degree at Heriot-Watt University. Very quickly, she fell in love with Paul and – after finishing her studies – she started freelancing as a translator and interpreter.Post-Brexit, this route will be closed to EU citizens, who will have to be able to prove they earn £, to be eligible for a work visa. Wieler Goodbrand didn’t come close to earning this sum when she started out. And yet today, she runs the Language Hub – a social enterprise offering affordable language classes and promoting bilingualism in Glasgow’s West End.“It’s brutal what you see online and in the newspapers,” she says. “We are told we have treated this country too much like our home. Well, it is our home and this is a good thing. When people treat the country like their home, they treat it well.“If I don’t care about my community, then nothing good comes from it. But I do care about it. I run a social enterprise because I think this community is lovely and deserves care.”The way the UK government talks about immigrants has made her question her decision to settle here.“I have lived in Scotland from the age of  to . I have had my career here,” she says. “But now I wonderI made a mistake because,I am being told I should not be here, then why did I give you my time and the best years of my professional le ”Wieler Goodbrand has not experienced much personal abuse – like the other EU citizens I speak to she believes living in Scotland is a protective factor – but she has faced logistical hurdles and much hurt.Last week, she finally applied for settled status. Then she downed two whiskies because she knew she wouldn’t be able to sleep. Her application has been accepted, but with no documentation to prove she is legally here she does not know how much help it will be. This is particularly worrying for her as her son suffers from a chronic illness which requires regular treatment.“Nothing has changed yet. But people started making things up as soon as the referendum was over,” she says. “When I was pregnant, I phoned the midwe and I was askedI had been here for  months. I was angry. No-one from the government had told staff to ask that question, so why was it being raised ”She is worried she will be forced to defend herselfshe turns up with her son at AE. She is also concerned employers will start to discriminate against those who are not British, not out of malice, but because they are confused about the rules or to avoid extra administration.Days earlier, she watched Nigel Farage bid goodbye to the European Parliament with an undignied display of flag-waving Auld Lang Syne. But she says greater hurt has been inflicted by those closer to home. “OK, there are these people who think it’s about flags. I don’t agree with that. I find it childish, but I don’t identy with them,” she says.“What is more problematic is that the people in whose community I live don’t understand how awful the last three years have been. When they read headlines in the Daily Mail, they don’t realise it is me they are talking about.“When they discuss, on social media, whether or not immigrants are an economic benefit, again it is me: the person who is their friend or relative.“Even those who are pro-immigration who think they are being helpful when they point out immigrants contribute . times [more in taxes than their indigenous counterparts] can be hurtful. I want to say to them: ‘I am so much more than this. I am a mother, a we, a human being. I am not a . times contribution.’ It is horrible to be reduced to a statistic.”Artist William Saraband had never visited Scotland when he made the decision to move from Portugal four years ago, but he was smitten with the image that had formed in his imagination. His early fascination, kindled by reading Walter Scott and listening to Celtic music, was reinforced by friendly customers in his mother’s café in Tavira in the Algarve.“Compared with other parts of the UK, the Scottish customers would be the ones who would always say: ‘Oh, you should come over. It’s brilliant in Scotland. We need young people just like you,” he says.By , Saraband and his boyfriend had decided there was no future for them in Portugal, which was still suffering the after-effects of the economic crash. There were few job opportunities for someone with a master’s degree in medieval history, so he was serving tables in his mother’s café while his dentist boyfriend worked six days a week for € a month.They moved to Edinburgh, knowing no-one, but immediately felt at home. Within a few months, they both had jobs, Saraband in the marketing department of a tech company, his boyfriend as a dentist.That was in November . By February , the anti-immigrant rhetoric was already being ramped up.“I started seeing something very dark. EU citizens were being talked about more and more in relation to NHS waiting times,” he says. “It led me to do something I had never done in Portugal: join a political party. The SNP wasn’t the only party to reject the xenophobia early on – the Greens and the Lib Dems were also good on the issue – but the SNP had the strongest non-apologetic voice. It was saying quite clearly that immigrants were valued.”Still in Portugal, Saraband’s mother is already feeling the impact of Brexit. The number of British tourists frequenting her café has decreased. So too has the number of expats. “Four families – three Scots and one from Northern Ireland – have come to say goodbye because they are selling their apartments and moving home,” he says. Friends who moved where in the UK have also been affected. He tells me about researchers in Liverpool who ed home in . “They told me that after the vote people were saying to them, ‘Aren’t you leaving now ’ asthat was what they were supposed to do.”In his Edinburgh bubble, Saraband feels insulated from the toxicity of Brexit, but says he is an optimist, not an idiot. “I know it is the Home Office, not the Scottish Government, that will take the decisions that affect my future.”Brexit will have no impact on his own relationship with Europe or cause a disconnect with his family. “I keep reminding myself that it is not me who is losing out. I still have  other countries where I can exercise my freedom of movement,” he says. “And yet, the one country where I want to exercise it is the one in which it is being denied to me. That is the irony”Eight-week-old Luna De Luca is lying on a changing table in her home in Maryhill, Glasgow. She is wearing a pretty hand-knitted dress and gurgling contentedly. Luna means “moon” in both her parents’ languages. In a week of symbols, this eight-week-old baby – born a fortnight before Boris Johnson won his victory, making Brexit inevitable – is a beacon in dark skies and a powerful testament to the European ideal.Luna will grow up to be tri-lingual. Her father Manuel, a university lecturer, will speak to her in Italian, her mother Caterine Arrabal, a lawyer, will speak to her in Spanish, and she will speak English in school. “She truly is a European breed,” says Manuel.Brexit poses no greater threat to the De Luca family than to anyone  in the UK. As the Spanish-born daughter of a Scots mother, Caterine already has dual nationality. Manuel, from Sicily has become a British citizen. Having moved to Scotland together  years ago, they have good jobs and a comfortable home.Yet none of this has made them complacent. They are shocked at the way attitudes to European immigrants have changed over the past few years and dismayed by the way the benefits of being a member of the EU have been so casually discarded.“What I love about Europe is the potential it offers for meeting people of other nationalities and doing all sorts of dferent things in dferent countries,” says Manuel.“When I moved to Spain, I saw lots of European people making new lives, mixing together having children. It is one of the highest achievements. In the UK, however, it is going to change. There will be quotas and fewer Europeans mixing with people here.” What frustrates Manuel is the lack of an angry fight-back. “We have seen some marches against Brexit, and some marches for independence, but there doesn’t seem to be a culture of demonstrating here. In France, they demonstrate all the time. People in France went on strike for a month over changes to the pension system. Those changes happened here and nobody said anything. Why can we not make more noise  Why can we not speak out with one voice ”While he and Caterine are upset by the UK’s departure from the EU, they believe Brexit might be the catalyst required to shake the country out of its complacency.“If you see this strategically, it could be a chance to change a system that is pretty old and not fair and not working any more,” says Manuel. “There is an Italian saying: ‘Si chiude la porta, si apre un portone’ or ‘sometimes a door will close, but an even bigger door will open’.“A door has been closed with Brexit, but maybe there will be a bigger door – an even stronger relationship with Europe in the future because people will have come to appreciate it more.”“I hope so, for this one’s sake,” adds Caterine, who has been breast-feeding her baby daughter on the sofa. “I want her to have all the opportunities that I had and more.”Luna lies milk-drunk and blissful in her mother’s lap.

I don’t think it’s OK to just give up and roll over and wait for Brexit to damage to our society and our economy.”He continued: “My best guess is the Tories will reach a point of recognition. The longer they hold out and say: ‘You’re not allowed to make this choice’, the stronger the support for independence will become.“They will recognise thatthey have any chance at all of persuading people not to opt for a positive future, as an independent member of the European Union, they are going to have allow that question to come sooner or later. The longer they leave it, the more determined people will become.”The SNP leader announced in a speech to party members last week plans to set up a new “constitutional convention” to establish a new Claim of Right and forge a broader campaign for a Yes vote.But the speech was branded “utterly predictable and entirely wrongheaded” by pro-Union leaders.The Greens, meanwhile, used an event in Glasgow on Friday to launch a renewed campaign in favour of independence, with the eventual aim of a new Scottish state joining the EU.Ska Keller, co-president of the Green group of MEPs in the European Parliament, used a speech in Glasgow to tell supporters that Scotland would be welcomed as a member state.Outlining his continued push for an indyref, Harvie added: “Greens are used to arguing against the odds and maintaining a principled position evenothers are saying no.“It is important that we do continue to assert the right of Scotland to decide the time-scale of the transition period. Every other member state has had a say, the UK has had a say. Scotland has tried to have a say and been ignored.“I think there is a principled argument to be made, that during the transition period, Scotland should have a say.”The First Minister has previously spoken of her desire to keep the “gold standard” of the  Edinburgh Agreement – which laid down the rules for the  referendum – but has so far refused to rule out a consultative ballot.“Should the UK government continue to deny Scotland’s right to choose, we may reach the point where it is necessary for this issue to be tested, she said last week. I am not ruling that out.”But the Greens list MSP maintained that calls for such a vote should not be heeded.“I don’t think anyone should be rushing towards that as an option,” he added.“I think it’s far betterwe can have this choice on a democratic basis without going to court, because I think that’s the best way to make sure both sides of the argument accept the rules and the legitimacy of the outcome.“If at some point it becomes utterly impossible and the UK becomes intransigent, even after , well possibly you might have to look at that. But it’s by no means an option we should be enthusiastic about.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm nicola sturgeon s knack keeps both sides on message","story":"If you thought Nicola Sturgeon had appealed for calm after Brexit, that#s not what her supporters heard, writes Euan McColm. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon possesses an ability for which other political leaders would sell their souls. She has the power to tell her party members one thing and for them to hear another.We’ve witnessed this happen, time and again, in recent years. Whenever Sturgeon has raised the subject of independence, she has left SNP members convinced they’ve heard the repetition of a promise to hold a second referendum in the immediate future.But those listening closely will have heard the First Minister say something dferent. Sturgeon’s speeches on the matter are full of shoulds and my intentionses, qualiers that loosen the wheels on her wagon.In a speech delivered to SNP members on Friday, Sturgeon really went for it when it came to the constitutional shake-up that she predicts is imminent.Quoting the late Nelson Mandela, Sturgeon said: “It always seems impossible until it is done.” She believed that, in Scotland, we are on the cusp of such a moment. Whether the battle to end apartheid in South Africa and the fight for Scottish independence are analogous is one to wrestle with. Doubtless, many Yes campaigners see their cause as a righteous crusade to overthrow Scotland’s oppressors. Others may think the First Minister might want to get a grip.Anyway, the Sturgeon speech, her reaction to the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, was full of red meat for the nationalists. There was the usual stuff – which has so far failed to sht polls in favour of the independence movement – about Scotland being dragged out of the EU, and there was a flirtation, too, with the question of the Scottish Government holding a consultative votethe UK government continues to reject the nationalists’ request to have the power to hold a referendum transferred to Edinburgh.Sturgeon was not wildly enthusiastic about the idea but many of those in the audience, including a number of elected members, think the First Minister should push ahead with a referendum and let the government at Westminster try to stop her. They will have heard Sturgeon say she was not ruling out testing the Scottish Government’s ability to hold its own referendum and been satisfied that the possibility of radical action was real and present.When she succeeded Alex Salmond in , Sturgeon pledged to be a First Minister for all Scots, regardless of how they had voted in the independence referendum. But her talk of uniting Scotland didn’t last long as the SNP membership soared and she came under intense pressure from all those new activists to hold a second referendum as soon as possible.Since then, Sturgeon has engaged in a relentless process of marching her troops halfway up the hill and then back down again and then back up and then back down. She dangles in front of the SNP membership an indyref that she is unable to deliver and tells Scots we yearn to put right the mistake of .But, despite the First Minister’s insistence that the Yes movement is moving forward with growing momentum, polls stubbornly refuse to sht in the nationalists’ favour. Sturgeon’s crystal ball told her that ious political outcomes would boost the independence cause. Theof a majority Tory government at Westminster in  was supposed to do it victory for the Leave campaign in the following year’s EU referendum was supposed to do it and the elevation to Prime Minister of Boris Johnson was supposed to do it. None of these things appears to have done it.Though more excitable nationalists will have heard Sturgeon refuse to rule out a referendum held without the permission of the UK government, others will have heard a dferent speech. They’ll have heard Sturgeon call for a calm and level-headed approach they’ll have heard her say there is no shortcut to independence and that victory for the Yes campaign in any future referendum was dependent on a number of Scots changing their minds on the constitutional question.I wonder for how much longer Sturgeon believes she can continue to face both ways on the matter of another independence referendum  Her current strategy of ratcheting up expectations among supporters and then immediately letting them down is becoming positively sadomasochistic. Surely someone’s going to shout the safe word.Sturgeon looks like a politician who has run out of ideas. She might say she understands the need to win the confidence of pro-UK voters but she shows no inclination towards shting the political agenda on to the domestic matters that these voters prioritise. Perhaps unwilling to invite real scrutiny from those voters, Sturgeon gives all of her attention to those already persuaded by the arguments for independence. How this approach is expected to increase support for the breaks-up of the UK is anybody’s guess.Sturgeon’s speech on Friday was supposed to be a reflection on Brexit but it was no such thing. No matter how the UK had voted in , the SNP would always have argued in favour of independence, Of course, Sturgeon was going to say that Brexit enhanced the case for independence. There has been no reflection on Brexit beyond the wording of arguments about how it impacts on the case for independence.Here, I think, the First Minister will find herself truly out of step with many Scottish voters. Only a minority of Scots wanted Brexit but that doesn’t mean the majority will think the answer to this outcome lies in more constitutional uncertainty.There are those within the SNP who would have liked the First Minister to have used her speech on Friday to apply the brakes on the independence charabanc. They’d have liked to hear her talk about the need to see the lie of the post-Brexit land before making a fresh case for independence.Instead, we got more of the usual preaching to the converted that we’ve been hearing for more than five years.Sturgeon’s big speech on Brexit told enthusiastic nationalists that independence was imminent, it told gradualists that independence was a time away. And it told the rest of us that the First Minister is running low on ideas for shting opinion in favour of the break-up of the UK.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"independent scotland would get enthusiastic welcome from eu says donald tusk","story":"But the comments came under fire from Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab who hinted that it may encourage other \"secessionist\" movements in Europe.Askedthe Scottish Government could expect encouragement from the EU,it sought to rejoin, Mr Tusk told the BBCs Andrew Marr Show: \"Emotionally I have no doubt that everybody would be enthusiastic here in Brussels and more widely, more generally in Europe.\"Mr Tusk added that he felt \"empathy\" for the position of Scotland.Scotland would not be automatically accepted into the Brussels Bloc, with\"formalities\" and treaty agreements requiring to be adhered to.But he added: \"If something like, for example, the independence of Scotland happens then we need a regular new process.\"Its a new situation, a new country, then it means a new process.\"But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab hit out at Mr Tusks comments.\"I think it was frankly un-European and irresponsible given the secessionist, separatist tendencies in Spain, France and Italy,\" he said.\"Im not sure that European leaders, let alone here in the UK would actually welcome thatkind of language.\"Mr Raab insisted that Scotland will have a \"great opportunity\" to take advantage of the UKs \"levelling up\" agenda.He added \"At the same time, we ought to expect the SNP to live up to its commitment to honour the outcome of the independence referendum, not to keep coming back and asking for a second one.\"Mr Raab also dismissed the Scottish Governments call last week for a separate visa system for Scotland to ensure immigration levels hold up after Brexit.He said: \"Either its unworkable or its going to be so draconian you would have to require people in the United Kingdom to stay in one part of the United Kingdom.

It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

Matthew Taggart, , who is in the first year of a foundation degree apprenticeship in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Translink in Belfast, said he believes the opportunity to gain qualications with no fees while getting paid to work is something that all young people should consider.Workplus, which helps employers develop talent through apprenticeships, estimates that almost poundm will be earned by the successful candidates over the period of their apprenticeships, some of which will last up to six years, with the possibility of permanent jobs.Those successful will take up positions at companies including Farrans, Translink, Atkins, Liberty IT, Jacobs and McAdam Design in the autumn to gain on the job training in career areas including engineering, construction, IT, administration and accountancy.Matthew said: “After my AS Levels at Ballymena Academy I went straight into a Workplus apprenticeship with Translink and spent two years doing a Level  BTEC. “Now I’m in the first year of a foundation degree, working on projects at Translink which are both interesting and challenging four days a week and attending classes at South West College in Omagh one day a week.“The greatest benefit of being an apprentice is that I’m able to work and learn on the job, while also working towards the qualications I need to apply for jobs within the industry.“Some of my friends who are at university wish they’d taken the same path as me because I’m earning a wage and as my fees are being paid I’ll have no debt at the end. I’d recommend that all young people considering higher education take a look at the apprenticeship opportunities available with Workplus.”Gavin McFarland, Programme Manager at Translink, said: “Workplus gives us access to a large pool of talented young people. Our Civil Engineering apprentices are valued members of our Infrastructure and Projects team. They take full advantage of opportunities to develop their academic learning and professional qualications, while earning an attractive salary. We are pleased to support Workplus and would recommend it to other employers seeking to attract talented young people. “Richard Kirk, Director of Workplus, explained: “Many of the young people who are applying for Workplus Apprenticeships are telling us that full time study along with the debt and career uncertainty at the end is not the right route for them.“Our apprentices get real jobs, good pay with a starting salary between pound, to pound, depending on entry level, as well as access to training and professional networks that will transform their lives.”Applications for this year’s Workplus scheme are open until February  at www.workplus.app "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2719899.jpg--.jpg?1580378297000\n","title":"my top 10 artie mcauley s musical memories","story":"THE next rambler on our new musical meander down memory lane is the inimitable Mr. Artie McAuley.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Masonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"orangemen aim to scale kilimanjaro","story":"A dozen Orangemen from Co Down are planning an ambitious trip to Africa during which they will attempt to scale Mount Kilimanjaro.The men from Banbridge District No  have a proud history of undertaking gruelling fundraising ventures, with this particular challenge requiring two years of groundwork.Deputy District Master Stuart Magill said: “In this last  years at Banbridge Orange Hall we’ve raised over £, for dferent causes and charities.“Drumming For Heroes from LOL  has raised £,. They’ve carried a Lambeg drum up to the top of Ben Nevis and cycled from John O’Groats to Landsend with a Lambeg on the back of a bike. “They also did the four peaks of the UK in four days, and walked the route of King Billy from the south of England to Carrickfergus and down to the Boyne, also bringing the Lambeg.”Banbridge Orange Hall is home to several dferent lodges including LOL  and LOL  of which Stuart is a member. “This time it will be our lodge that’s doing Kilimanjaro though we won’t be bringing a Lambeg – it’s going to be hard enough as it is,” he continued. “It’s a follow up to the Walk of Remembrance when we walked  miles from Thiepval Memorial to Menin Gate.”The -year-old added: “It was my idea to climb Killimanjaro. I’ve never done it before, that’s why I want to do it. “There’s  of us doing it. My biggest worry was getting .

There’s a big build to allow us to pay for it, the cost of the trip is coming out of each person’s pocket so that every penny raised is going to the charity. It also gives us plenty of time to train for it, and also to raise money for the two charities.”Two charities are set to benefit – the Children’s Cancer Unit in Royal Victoria Hospital and Angel Wishes which helps children with cancer and supports their families.He said the two charities were close to the hearts of those taking part in the trek as they were good friends with a family from Banbridge who are indebted to the services provided by the organisations.In pictures: NI man finds beauty in derelict properties around the Province Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Stuart said: “The oldest person taking part is in his sixties and the youngest is in his twenties. “The majority of training will be in the Mournes for fitness and stamina, but there’s no training over here really for the altitude.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph transfer test guide reveals scores accepted by every northern ireland school","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With Ellie in surgery, Mr and Mrs McDonnell were told to prepare for the worst as the extent of her injuries left doctors unsure of her survival, never mind whether shed ever be able to walk or talk again.\"We walked past her bed we didnt recognise Ellie, who was unconscious, at first,\" Mary said of their post-operation reunion.\"Her head was double the size it should be, she was like an alien. There were so many tubes, computers, monitors and breathing machines around her.\"She didnt look like a wee girl. She looked like an old woman. She was hanging by a thread.\"Ellie was \"so close to death\" that neither Mary or Peter left her hospital bedside during those long, worrying weeks.Mary recalled the first thing Ellie - who initially thought shed sustained her injuries falling off her horse Olaf - said to her when she first came round.\"She smiled, and when I asked her how she was feeling she replied: Im feeling rather average - and shes never used that word [average] in her le,\" Mary said.\"The consultants themselves cant explain her recovery. They honestly thought she was going to die and they told me to prepare myself because she was so ill.\"Ellie, a pupil at Down High School, was finally discharged from hospital on September  last year, and her almost miraculous recovery has helped her mum overcome her guilt.\"That night [of the accident] I thought, how am I ever going to breathe again or liveEllie doesnt survive \" Mary recalled.\"I couldnt have survived without her. Were a very close family and we do everything together. It was an awful situation to be in. You run into your daughter and shes lying dying in front of you.\"But Mary also said she was \"glad it was me who hit her on the lane and not somebody \".\"I did what I did very quickly because I was damn sure I was going to do whatever I could to keep her alive,\" she added.\"Who knows  Somebody  could have frozen. Normally Im really squeamish around blood. Id go weak at the knees.\"But that day I didnt. Ive no idea why. Maybe the mothers instinct kicked in...\"Helicopter service relies on the publicAir Ambulance NI depends on public donations - it costs £, per day to keep the helicopter in the sky.

But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final.

The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

For just as I didn’t want this cold neither did they, but because a few decided to come in with their nasty cold germs, with the yucky green stuff, we’ve now all had it - thanks. googletag.cmd.push Of course, I understand this is not the children’s fault but, and sorry to say, it is down to those few parents who think ‘go to nursery however snotty and yucky you may be’. So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

Myself and councillor Brian McGuigan have been putting this on the agenda with local maintenance teams frequently, and since Brian was first elected to council back in  the resurfacing of these roads has been a common request from him.Whilst we can understand that the Tory governments policy of austerity has left the budget strained, and that the department have been in a dficult position, there is no denying that some of the roads in our locale are in a condition unfit for use in the st century.We in Sinn Feacutein will continue to demand upgrades to rural roads, as it is our belief that rural dwellers should not have to put up with sub-par services just because they live outside the cities. At the minute, the Moneyneany Road, used not just by locals but for a number of commuters travelling between Derry Dungiven and Cookstown, is more like a patchwork quilt than a road.Emma Sheerin added: We have seen a lack of investment West of the Bann since the creation of this state, and the road network we have is a testament to that. When you see the state of some of the B and C roads across Mid Ulster, it is little wonder that roads are a constant bugbear for rural dwellers. The Assembly woman added: I have written to the newly appointed Infrastructure minister asking that some of the aforementioned routes are prioritised, and we will be meeting with Mr McKinley from the local ision in order to request this also. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You have Celtic Thunder and Celtic Woman but theres not one man doing this, like a young Tommy Fleming.This last couple of months it has all kicked off for me with the successof the album and my show at the Millennium Forum being announced.Ive always wanted to do my own show in my hometown.Ive supported The Fureys at the Millennium Forum and hada few other guest spots but to have my own show is amazing.It has storytelling and uses a voice from beyond, so its quite dferent.Conor is currently in rehearsals for theMillennium Forum show and there are still a small number of tickets available.His -track album, A New Dawn, is available from his Facebook pageConorMcGintyMusic and on iTunes and Spoty at pound..His show of the same name will be at the Millennium Forum on March  and tickets are priced at pound. from the Millennium Forum Box Office   . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

victory at Bear Park.In a surprisingly entertaining game, both teams had half chances in the first few minutes with Olympicrsquos Damian Travers and Dylan McCartan unable to get shots on target.Forest should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when a Paul Kane corner kick was only cleared as far as Philly Flood, and his cross just evaded Ray Kendall who was sliding in at the back post.This was to be Floodrsquos last meaningful contribution to the game as he went over on his ankle and had to be replaced by McKibbin, with Jennings ping into left back.Tollymore started with almost the same team that was beaten last week with the exception of Paul Devlin, who was making his debut, and Mooney, Flood, and Paul Kane who were all unavailable last week.However, it was Devlin that made the dference in the first  minutes.The midfielder almost opened the scoring after  minutes when his sizzling free kick from the edge of the penalty area warmed the hands of lsquokeeper Dean Blackwood with Paul Kane heading the loose ball wide.Moments later a huge clearance from Tollymore lsquokeeper Imrie bounced over the Olympic defence, and Rory Walsh jumped with Blackwood only to see his header go wide of the target.Just as it seemed neither team was going to score, Devlin hit a wonder goal from  yards, with the power and swerve of the shot leaving Blackwood flat-footed.With the wind at their backs Tollymore stepped things up and in the th minute an astute pass from Kane picked out Rory Walsh who hit the Olympic crossbar.Devlin was replaced at half-time by Marty McCourt for his first game since early September, and while the big man looked rusty, he soon picked up the pace of the game.Both sides had half chances before Forest doubled their advantage in the th minute when a through ball from Kane saw Walsh nipping in behind the Olympic defence.The unlucky Stephen McConnell barged Walsh in the back with the striker tumbling into the advancing lsquokeeper and referee Mullan had no hesitation in awarding a sport kick.Paul Kane stepped up to take the penalty and lsquoThe Generalrsquo made no mistake to score his second goal in two games.Forest now started to take control and a terric run from James Jennings saw Maxwell and McConnell combining well to scramble the ball clear.In the st minute Walsh made the score - when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

Flooding peoplersquos lives with the hope found in the good news of the gospel, bringing out the God-colours into the world.That is to be your primary aim as a Bishop.The sermon was followed by the Rite of Ordination and for the ordination prayer and laying on of hands, Archbishop Clarke was joined by other bishops, the Methodist President and former Presidents.The new bishop was then vested in his robes and given a Bible before being presented to the congregation who greeted him with loud, sustained applause. The Dean of Belfast, the Very Rev Stephen Forde, then installed Bishop McClay in his cathedral stall.At the reception which followed in Ulster Universityrsquos Birley Building, Bishop McClay expressed his thanks to all those who had taken part in the service, his parents and family and the many people who had travelled a distance to be there.Bishop McClay said he looked forward to building on the work of two predecessors, Bishop Harold Miller and Bishop Gordon McMullan, who he had been ldquoprivileged to serve under.He added: ldquoIrsquom very grateful for all that they have put in place by way of a heritage to build upon.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs.

I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

Yet not only must we have SF in power in Stormont at all times, on their terms , the Fine Gael-led Irish government led the demand for such.The supposed Conservative and Unionist Party government was just as bad, locally represented by Julian Smith.Not only that, but Mr Smith is accused of saying that legacy would not be in the Stormont negotiations and deal, yet it was. It seemed that this was to please Sinn Fein..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The party once inextricably linked to the IRA is demanding that the Stormont House legacy structures be implemented in full. Republicans have little fear of these structures, but rather cannot wait to see them pick apart the security forces.The DUP yesterday in a letter to Mr Smith gave its clearest indication that it might be retreating from the legacy plan.This is welcome, although belated. The party could have walked from the Stormont talks the minute Mr Smith included legacy. Now Dublin, which is not even held to account under the legacy plan for its shameful extradition refusals during the long IRA campaign, will be able to complain about New Decade New Approach not being implemented.Legacy failures do not just relate to soldier prosecutions or the ‘police misconduct’ scandal. Also the fact that the PSNI is not trusted to investigate past cases, and that the planned Historical Investigations Unit will both investigate and adjudicate on the evidence it gathers. And even the government concludes that the Police Ombudsman should investigate the RUC indefinitely it will still mean that only the state is judged to the civil standard, as in legacy inquests, not terrorists.Last week a court ordered a hearing into a delay in the decision in the Pat Finucane case. The government has failed to use the executive power that the Supreme Court acknowledged it has to decide this case. Millions have already been spent on that one murder, a disgraceful imbalance. Now we need a raft of inquiries into terrorist murders.As someone who vividly recalls World War II, I rejoice that we are no longer in the corrupt European Union Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgementNI snow alert: Heavy snowfall expected overnight - temperature to feel a bitterly cold -degCNI snow  ice alert: Hour-by-hour NI weather forecast for duration of Met Office yellow status weather warningMan stabbed in face - PSNI deny tongue cut from mouth after gruesome image appears on social mediaStephen Nolan challenges everyone to join him in weight loss challenge afterdisappointment of putting weight back on remains profound        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Opinion\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/JM.jpg","title":"were in for another busy year ahead","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Are we in, or out  By the time you’re reading this, the UK is likely to be – from a technical perspective at least – about to leave the EU, and go it alone.In the four weeks or so since the last edition of the magazine, we’ve had a strong Tory majority pushing Brexit over the line and the restoration of devolution after three years without elected officials on the Hill. As we enter a new year and decade, there’s a sense, or a hope, of ato some form of normalised business environment. Brexit isn’t what business wanted, speaking generally, but it appears it’s what we’ve got. The minutiae of trading arrangements are still not worked out. Some sectors are more content than others, but we shouldn’t forget that Northern Ireland had a previous withdrawal deal on the table – largely backed by business – little over a year ago which could have set us apart as a unique trading environment, maintaining strong links with the Republic and the wider EU marketplace. But some of those in the political sphere seemingly put their own self interest and ideology above the future of the economy, and those who live in it. Tonight, some will take to the streets in and around the heart of the UK Government to show to the world their joy – perhaps misplaced – over the exit from the EU. For some, purely from a nationalistic perspective, its a chance to satisfy all the cliches that have plagued us over the last three years or so and for others, a chance to revel in an perceived brave new world – forged and fuelled by thoughts of a rose-tinted Britain gone by, Crystal Palace, heaving smoke stacks, heavy industry and fish and chips served up in newspaper on a pebble beach. For Northern Ireland business, and many people here, much of that platonic ideal is dficult to comprehend – especially among a younger generation. You just have to look at the breakdown in demographic of voters in the last General Election to see that. For some, tonight will be a time to mourn. Leaving the largest trading bloc in the world and, for better or worse, going it alone. Regardless, tomorrow and after the transition period in less than a years time, the hard work begins in trying to re-establish trading relationships with our EU partners which would see as little friction or duty as possible. Well know in the coming months whether the new market opportunities we have been promised will materialise, how long the processes will take, and what the immediate impact of exiting the EU will be for business across the UK and Ireland.We can now welcome the fact that we now have a working government at Stormont. Our MLAs are now back in their seats, committees up-and-running, and ministers staring at burgeoning in-trays. There seems to be some form of contentment and agreement among our parties on a range of important issues, including mental health. We are, however, already seeing the odd ergence, including whether we should continue the move to devolve and reduce corporation tax here – Finance Minister Conor Murphy pushing it into the long grass, while Economy Minister Diane Dodds has suggested that it remains on the policy books as an option.It’s just one of the myriad of areas of the economy and business which need to be addressed in the coming weeks and months – including a close look at the draft rates revaluation, which has certainly got the dander up among some of our best-known hospitality businesses.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
