again","story":"(Picture: NewsquestSWNS)A great-grandmother who thought she would never be able to walk again has taken her first steps eight months after she was left with no feeling below the waist.Sheila Pirie, from Alyth, Perthshire, was left unable to walk after a spinal abscess damaged her nerves and left her with no feeling below the waist.When the 73-year-old arrived at Balhousie care home in Coupar Angus, Perthshire, last August she was in a wheelchair and needed a full-body hoist to lift her in and out of bed.However, for the past eight months, Sheila has been having physiotherapy.Before the physiotherapy, Sheila, a widowed mother-of-four, underwent surgery to remove a giant gallstone in 2016, but collapsed in theatre and ended up in intensive care.Doctors tried to blast the gallstone using ultrasound waves but the procedure was unsuccessful.Sheila, who also suffers from renal failure and requires dialysis three times a week, ended up in hospital for eight months as her health fluctuated.(Picture: NewsquestSWNS)She added: ‘Two or three times I ended up in the intensive care unit. They didn’t know whether I was going to pull through or not.’The spinal abscess developed while Sheila was in hospital, as a result of an infection.In some cases this can lead to permanent paralysis, and she initially lost all feeling below her waist.Although she regained some sensation in her left leg, her right leg remained numb and as a result she was confined to a wheelchair.But her mobility was transformed after former A\u0026ampE and occupational health nurse Kate Barry spotted the potential for nerve regeneration.Kate had been working at Balhousie for around six months when Sheila arrived in August 2017.Sheila was put on a tough regime of pilates, arm and leg exercises designed to rebuild her muscle and balance.Gradually, she was able to move from a wheelchair to a walking frame and now uses a three-wheel frame.Kate said: ‘Sheila complained of pain in her right leg, and that was the one she had had no feeling in.‘I asked her what sort of pain and she said it was an electric shock type pain and I said ‘good’ because that was a sign of nerve regeneration.(Picture: NewsquestSWNS)‘Nerves can take up to two years to regenerate if they’ve been damaged and it is described as an ‘electric shock’ sensation when they regenerate.‘I got the GP in to see her, arranged for physiotherapy and the physiotherapist agreed that the pain was a sign of nerve regeneration so they started Sheila on a programme of exercises.”‘At first, Sheila’s muscle tone had all gone. She had a lot of pain and she ended up on painkillers because the nerve regeneration pain can be very bad.‘We had to walk beside her at first just because of the falls risk, and now she can get herself to the bathroom, go to the loo by herself, shower herself, she’s becoming very independent.’Since Sheila had eight months of physiotherapy, she is now back on her feet, and taking part in a 35 million step virtual walk from Scotland to Australia.The walk, which is being measured on a pedometer, was organised by the care home’s activities coordinator.She said: ‘We’re about 60 per cent of the way now. We should reach Australia by the end of April or beginning of May.’Sheila added: ‘It was very hard work but I must admit now it was worth it.’Sheila is now one of the most active residents at Balhousie care home, which also looks after residents with cognitive illness such as dementia.MORE: ‘Healthy’ food companies need to distance themselves from the emotional language of toxic diet cultureMORE: There’s a food delivery app that only sells Garfield themed cuisine"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/00/4B0FCAA600000578-5605631-image-a-33_1523490173341.jpg","title":"Usain Bolt sips cognac Gold Coasts Sin City nightclub","story":"Jamaican sprint legend Usain Bolt sipped cognac with friends and danced alongside DJ J-dub at the Gold Coast\u0027s Sin City nightclub until 4am on Thursday (pictured)          Video footage and pictures taken by revellers show Bolt in the DJ booth, talking to the crowded dance floor (pictured)Video footage and pictures taken by revellers show Bolt in the DJ booth, talking to the crowded dance floor.\u0027Let me feel everything you\u0027ve got,\u0027 he said, according to the publication.\u0027Yoyo, motherf***ers, hard core.\u0027The superstar left out the club\u0027s back door around 4am.Let\u0027s get this party started!

But he was cruelly frozen out when Zuckerberg dropped out to run the site full-time. After a lengthy legal battle, Saverin got around £750 million in compensation.Also dispensed with were Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, fellow undergraduates who hired Zuckerberg to program a dating website and claimed key features of their idea were then stolen and used on Facebook. They received a reported £43 million in an out-of-court settlement.Chez ZuckerbergZuckerberg moved directly to Silicon Valley after dropping out of Harvard.His journey up the local property ladder has been avidly chronicled via his own website ever since, with the billionaire sharing regular behind-the-scenes images of his comparatively modest domestic set-up.For several years, he rented a four-bedroom house in a leafy suburb of Palo Alto — a wealthy city adjacent to San Francisco where almost every major internet firm is based — for a (by local standards) paltry £3,500 a month.          Wild: Zuckerberg and his wife and daughter in Where The Wild Things Are costumes (shown)He also drove a beaten-up Honda Acura, on the grounds that it was ‘safe, comfortable, not ostentatious’.Finally, in 2011, he became a homeowner, spending £4 million on a two-storey, five-bedroom property ten minutes from Facebook’s head office (where he typically works for 60-70 hours a week).He also upgraded his car to a Volkswagen Golf GTI, which he drives to company HQ at 8am in order to attend daily sessions with a personal trainer.The house is fashionably decorated, with wooden floors, beige carpets, and (famously) not a single television set.It’s a pretty humble abode for one of the world’s wealthiest men and supporters of Zuckerberg invariably like to observe that he has no time for the gated mansions and mega-yachts of other, more brash billionaires.What they usually fail to mention is that Zuckerberg also spent a punchy £21 million buying up all of the neighbouring houses that overlook his oh-so-humble home and its garden. And in 2014, he dropped another £75 million buying up 750 acres of the idyllic Hawaiian island of Kauai, in order — one assumes — to one day build a proper Bond -villain-style residence.The doctor wife          Zuckerberg jokes around about hard workAside from his trillion-dollar tech firm, Zuckerberg’s wife, Priscilla Chan, is the other great legacy of his stint at Harvard. The couple met one Friday night during a beer-fuelled party at the all-male ‘fraternity house’ where Mark lived. ‘He was this nerdy guy who was just a little bit out there,’ recalled ‘Cilla’, as she is known to friends, in a rare interview.History relates that they struck up a conversation while queuing for the loo: he charmed her with computer science-based ‘college humour’, apparently.After graduating from medical school, Priscilla, the daughter of Chinese ‘boat people’ from Vietnam, whose family fled communism during the Cold War, moved to Palo Alto and began working at San Francisco General Hospital.The couple moved in together in 2010, announcing this and every other formative step in their relationship via Facebook. ‘Now we have 2x everything, so if you need any household appliances, dishes, glasses, etc, please come by and take them before we give them away,’ they declared.The wedding was in 2012, days after the launch of Facebook on the stock market minted their status as billionaires, and they honeymooned in Rome, where they were photographed in that well-known Italian destination restaurant, McDonald’s.Though fully qualified as a paediatrician, Priscilla no longer has an employer to list on social media: like many a billionaire’s spouse, she devotes herself to philanthropy, running a personal charity dedicated to ‘advancing human potential and promoting equal opportunity’.Wacky home lifeThe business model of Facebook (not to mention the source of many of its recent troubles) rests on the belief that a person’s character is laid bare by the sort of thing they profess to ‘like’ on social media.On this front, Mark Zuckerberg has declared himself a fan of the sport of fencing, the pop acts Green Day, Taylor Swift, Shakira, and Jay-Z, the movie Gladiator and the fruity and violent TV series Game Of Thrones.He and Priscilla also try to find time in their busy schedules to cook family meals and bake bread, cakes and biscuits, and tend to celebrate special occasions by heading out to parties wearing wacky fancy dress outfits. Recent times have seen the family dress as Jedi knights, medieval warriors, and characters from the children’s book Where The Wild Things Are.    Face of a family: Mark Zuckerberg shown with his wife Priscilla and parents Edward and KarenWhat a psychologist might make of this is anyone’s guess, though his appearance in front of the U.S. Congress this week suggests the real Zuckerberg is nowhere near as free-wheeling and zany as his carefully curated Facebook page suggests.In fact, he’s a man with such apparent incapacity for introspection that many have suggested he may be autistic and even close friends admit that he often looks and sounds like a robot.In 2010, one told The New Yorker: ‘He’s been over-programmed.’Instead of spontaneously pursuing hobbies, Zuckerberg likes to give himself annual ‘challenges’, which he announces to his 107 m Facebook followers. They have included learning to speak Mandarin (‘some members of Priscilla’s family only speak Chinese and I want to be able to talk to them’) and, in 2011, to ‘only eat meat if I killed the animal myself’.Zuckerberg was once thought to be an atheist, but now likes to share photographs of his family celebrating Jewish festivals, stating in one caption: ‘I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period when I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.’ Priscilla, for her part, practises Buddhism.The doting dadLike millions of his users, Zuckerberg is an aficionado of ‘sharenting’ — the modern-day practice of using social media to bombard friends and acquaintances with sometimes intimate items of family news.In 2015, he told the world that Priscilla was pregnant for the first time in a heartfelt post revealing that she’d previously suffered three miscarriages, pledging to take two months’ paternity leave after becoming a father.          Zuckerberg is an aficionado of ‘sharenting’ — the modern-day practice of using social media to bombard friends and acquaintances with sometimes intimate items of family newsTheir daughter, Maxima, arrived later that year. Revealing the happy news, he used Facebook to announce that he intended to give away 99 per cent of his shares in the company during his lifetime, in an effort to make the world that she grows up in a ‘better place’.When a second girl, August, came along last summer, Zuckerberg uploaded a similarly preachy message, welcoming his newborn to the world via an open letter that urged her to make the most of childhood by finding as much time as possible to ‘go outside and play’.Somewhat awkwardly, Facebook made headlines just three months later by announcing it was launching Messenger Kids, a program designed to encourage his customers’ children to devote even more of their waking hours to staring at a screen.The fifth member of the Zuckerberg clan is Beast, a dreadlocked Hungarian sheepdog acquired from a breeder in Oregon in 2011.Naturally, the little fellow boasts his own Facebook page, with an astonishing 2.7 million followers. It contains videos of him performing a host of party tricks: dancing to rap music, barking at the Rocky theme tunes and scampering along a treadmill in his master’s home gymnasium.Although there’s also footage of Beast travelling to a rural farm to try his hand at herding sheep, the pooch’s days are largely spent in suburban Palo Alto, where his master can often be spotted walking him to the local park.          SURROUNDED: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a joint hearing of the US Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill, April 10, 2018 in Washington, DCFrom time to time, like every member of the household, he’s also required to sacrifice his dignity to indulge Mark’s love of fancy dress. Recently, he’s been photographed in everything from Star Wars outfits to faux-medieval headgear and Jewish religious attire.That T-shirtSilicon Valley myth has it that Zuckerberg’s wardrobe is stuck in perpetual adolescence, with his supposed outfit of choice a grey T-shirt and dark hooded top teamed with grey jeans, which he once claimed to wear daily in order to limit time wasted making ‘frivolous decisions’, such as deciding what to wear.In 2012, he cemented this reputation for scruffiness by turning up in a ‘hoodie’ to pitch his multi-billion-dollar IPO share offer to Wall Street executives.Around the same time, he was said to have worn pyjamas to a meeting with financial backers.Zuckerberg’s Facebook page reveals something subtly different, however: he frequently does put on a suit and tie — provided it helps him keep up appearances.So it goes that he’s donned formal attire to meet everyone from Barack Obama to the Pope and, of course, to appear before Congress this week. He also dressed up for his wedding.At Facebook HQ, meanwhile, there’s no official dress code.          Members of the audience hold up signs and wear sunglasses that read \u0027Stop Spying\u0027 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a joint hearing of the Commerce and Judiciary Committees on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, April 10, 2018But this trendy policy only extends so far: in a 2016 memoir, former employee Antonio Garcia Martinez claimed the male-dominated tech firm’s female employees were required to ‘avoid clothing that “distracted” co-workers’, adding that women who wore ‘revealing’ dresses were ‘read the riot act’.His foul mouthHowever carefully he might curate his public Facebook page, Zuckerberg hasn’t always behaved like a cuddly family man.In the early days, his business card read ‘I’m CEO, bitch,’ and, in private messages to colleagues, several of which became public during litigation, he described the site’s users as ‘dumb f**ks’ for handing over personal information to him for free.Time would, of course, prove him right: today, his 18 per cent stake in the firm provides him access to intimate details about the private lives of its two billion users. Every message they send, photograph they share and place from where they update their profile are stored on the company’s computer systems.For handing over this valuable resource, Facebook users have been paid precisely nothing.Whether Zuckerberg appreciates the responsibilities this ought to confer on him is hard to gauge.          In the well: Zuckerberg sat alone as he was questioned by the senatorsDuring the recent crisis over the firm Cambridge Analytica harvesting data from Facebook users — which knocked $60 billion off the value of the company’s shares — he took four days to make any statement and a further 24 hours to issue something approaching an apology.Presidential ambitionsSo convinced is Zuckerberg of his own brilliance that there is mounting speculation he’s thinking of one day mounting a bid for the U.S. presidency.To this end, he recently used Facebook to announce that he’s spending the year on a so-called ‘listening tour’ of all 50 U.S. states, ostensibly to listen to Facebook users, voters and local lawmakers, hiring Charles Ommanney, a photographer for the Bush and Obama campaigns, to document the exercise.His exact political allegiances are unclear: though undoubtedly a social liberal who vigorously supports gay rights and has been highly critical of Donald Trump’s policy towards immigrants and racial minorities, Zuckerberg is also thought to be fiscally conservative and his own company’s tax affairs are a case study in rapacious capitalism.He has appeared at fundraisers with the Republican governor Chris Christie in his native New Jersey, too, though the occasion was staged to mark his decision to donate $100 million to local schools, rather than to represent a political endorsement.Although he now employs Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe and his pollster Joel Benenson, and is certainly rich enough to run for the White House, he has repeatedly — for public consumption — denied any plans to run for office.Perhaps that’s just as well — for, as this week has shown, all the money in the world hasn’t helped this awkward young billionaire avoid a political car crash.

The oversight is a criminal offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prisonThe mortgages were issued by a private bank to Mare Pond Properties Limited, a company set up by Mr Hunt and his wife Lucia Guo. Miss Guo was the only person named in the registration documents filed at Companies House when the firm was incorporated in September 2017. Mr Hunt appears to have breached the Companies Act on two counts. He should have declared to Companies House he was a \u0027person with significant control\u0027 within 28 days of registration. But he did not do so for six months.Legislation passed by the Tories in 2016 made this compulsory for anyone who has more than 25 per cent of shares or voting rights in a company. The law was a central part of the Government\u0027s plan to tackle money laundering, and failure to comply is an offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prison.The second breach relates to the fact Mr Hunt\u0027s name was omitted from the registration document – a criminal offence under another section of the Companies Act. Parliamentary rules state MPs must register any shareholding greater than 15 per cent in any company within 28 days. But Mr Hunt took nearly five months to do so, registering his co-ownership of the company alongside the purchase of the flats in the Register of MPs\u0027 Interests on March 7.He told the Telegraph the breaches were down to an honest mistake by his accountant and that he had corrected the listing after being alerted to it by a member of the public on March 28.           Mr Hunt has not breached the Ministerial Code of Conduct with the Ocean Village breach, according to Cabinet Office rules, and so retains the backing of Theresa MayHis spokesman said: \u0027These were honest administrative mistakes which have already been rectified. \u0027Jeremy\u0027s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing which was a genuine oversight.\u0027The Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code. Jeremy declared the interest to them after the company was set up. \u0027They advised that as it was a shell company with no assets or value, it should only be registered when it became operational. \u0027As such, Jeremy presumed the same rules applied to Parliamentary declarations ...

It was officially called off on Friday at 7.30am as hopes faded of finding the missing woman.“It is with a very heavy heart that I need to let you know that we have been unable to locate our guest,” the captain of the Dawn Pacific told passengers on Friday morning.“We are still in the area of the incident, and the weather conditions with the swell three to four metres high, as you can see outside, the strong wind made our search extremely challenging.“As a result, we have now made the extremely difficult decision to continue our journey towards Brisbane. I know I speak on behalf of all of you when I say our thoughts and prayers are with the family.”The woman was believed to have been on holiday with her husband and children. Passengers said her husband saw her fall and went into shock, the Courier-Mail reported.“The difficult decision to suspend the search was made only after expert advice that survival after this length of time in difficult sea conditions and after a full night at sea was not considered possible,” Carnival Australia spokesman David Jones said. Jones said earlier that a crew member notified the bridge as soon as the woman fell and the “man overboard” incident response was activated immediately.“In line with this response, Pacific Dawn turned around to follow the course it was on at the time of the incident.”The Australian Maritime Safety Authority and New Caledonian authorities issued a call for nearby vessels to assist in the search.Queensland police officers would board the ship when it arrived in Brisbane on Saturday about 11am, she said. A passenger, who asked not to be named, described the atmosphere on the ship as “very sad, solemn and quiet”.The ship was on a seven-night cruise from Brisbane to the South Pacific with scheduled calls to Noumea, Lifou and Port Vila."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa369dffc17fc79193c1dc2d95fff372449ad81/0_21_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ccaf0e7280d369382ff83a740fa1258b 2600w","title":"where are the people gold coast empty for commonwealth games","story":"Deserted streets, empty cafes and angry taxi drivers as local businesses battle unexpected downturn On the tourist strip of Cavill Avenue, people spill out of bars in the early afternoon. Footpaths are jostling with all sorts: groups of teenagers straggling back from the beach, families walking to lunch.About 150 metres from Cavill, in the heart of Surfers Paradise, a couple of backpackers eat their lunch in an otherwise empty laneway.Carla Viera runs the Orchid Vegetarian cafe, tucked away from the main strip. The period should be one of her busiest of the year – the temperature is still 27C and perfect for the beach. In Queensland, schools have been in recess since the Easter long weekend. And then there’s the Commonwealth Games, an event predicted to tip $323m directly into the local economy from Games tourists.“This is the most honest I can be,” Viera says between pulling coffees and grilling lunch for her two customers.“Last week, there was one day, from 6.30am to 10pm, when I closed there was $150 in the till. There was just nobody in the streets. So that’s how bad it was.”“I had all these staff that I hired and I had to let go. I feel bad for them, but it’s a survival thing. I still have to pay rent.“I’m OK here, I’m stocked up with coconut water and dry lentils, things that don’t go bad, but I really feel for the other businesses.”The same story is being echoed up and down the coast. A nearby shop that leases moped scooters, a favourite pastime of visitors to the glitter strip for decades, reports about half the number of customers than usual.Uber and cab drivers say their trade is well below normal. Prabh Jit Sings says it has been very quiet. Another cabbie, John, says he can barely find a fare from Surfer’s Paradise.“It’s OK traffic from the airport, but that’s it. No one is paying to go on public transport, so who needs a cab otherwise?”A lot of the anger seems to stem from an impression that Commonwealth Games organisers convinced some people to stay away. Locals and businesses had been sternly warned about the potential for traffic chaos and massive crowds during the Games fortnight.Almost a year ago, non-tourism businesses in the vicinity of Games venues were briefed about gridlock and urged to keep nonessential staff at home. Many decided to shut their doors and send staff on holidays, along with a large contingent of Gold Coast locals who opted to leave town.The Games chairman, Peter Beattie, told reporters this week that the M1 motorway, the main link between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, was “a bit of a dog, so the last thing we wanted was people on it”. For most of this Games, with fewer commuters on the roads and others scared away, the M1 has been a smooth run.Event spectators were encouraged to use public transport, including the city’s $1bn light rail network, which will be the Games’ most significant legacy infrastructure project. There have been few problems or delays getting to and from events. The Queensland tourism minister, Kate Jones, says the patronage figures for Games public transport will on Friday hit 2 million.“There were reports in the paper for months and months and months saying it was going to be chaos,” Jones said.Jones says visitor numbers are tracking towards 680,000, better than the 600,000 expected. She also said there would be long-term benefits to the coast from the exposure and infrastructure.“There’s no doubt that Easter weekend was slower than normal and I think that was because of people choosing to come later and stay at home over Easter,” Jones said.“Major hotel chains are reporting an increase of occupancy compared to this time of year.“There definitely seems to be a picking up, particularly when the athletics started. A lot of Gold Coasters who didn’t want to be a part of the Games thought it would be so busy they might have been better to get out.”Jones said some hotels had been “price gouging” in the hope of a payday that never came. Those that set reasonable prices sold out. She said those concerns about hotel prices and traffic problems might have initially discouraged people, but that 80,000 tickets to events had been sold since the opening ceremony.The director of corporate affairs at Gold Coast Tourism, Dean Gould, said “some operators are feeling very buoyed by the Games spin-off and others feeling like they might have missed out”.“The sentiment among retailers and restaurateurs is picking up in direction proportion to the crowds on the streets around their premises,” Gould said.“The Games has been a resounding success from the point of view of attracting visitors, selling tickets, filling stadiums and showcasing the destination to the world. We expect that positive exposure to support the destination marketing message for years.”A Griffith University report estimated that the federal and Queensland government spent a combined $1.78bn putting on the Games, with about $1.25bn in additional economic activity generated from the private sector.Of that, tourists who attended the Games were expected to generate $323m. But business owners say those figures clearly don’t reflect the reality on the ground.Kader Hammadi is the manager of the On Fire, a cafe in Broadbeach, which has been probably the most active of any of the coast’s main hubs. Hammadi’s cafe is 50 metres from a Games “festival” site, with live music, entertainment and big screens for events.“Even when they say there’s extra people in town, I don’t know where they are. They’re not in Currumbin, they’re not in Surfers, they’re not in Main Beach. And they’re not here in Broadbeach.”“The toughest thing they did was saying to everyone, advertising don’t come to town, put your cars away. There is no traffic.“All our regulars are gone. They made our regulars think it was going to be crazy, they’re gone for two weeks, three weeks minimum. All the buildings that put their rent up like crazy, now they’re all dropping the price.”Most businesses say this week, while still slower than expected, is at least better than last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bc71b355b6b317a7dfe462cef75cad793391ab7/0_0_2643_1585/master/2643.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0746d3900a8dcac1ab803e0307acc6c2 1240w","title":"house prices generation rent estate agents demand mortgage lending decline","story":"Estate agents face a quiet house-buying season with demand and mortgage lending in declineApril traditionally marks the start of Britain’s house-buying season. Once the daffodils come out, estate agents ready themselves for a rush of prospective buyers.Just to be clear, this is not a national disaster: rather, the recent developments in the property market are inevitable and good. They show that even in the weird world of the UK property market – where demand is encouraged and supply restricted – the basic laws of economics sometimes operate.Demand for property is falling because asking prices are too high for buyers – even with interest rates at exceptionally low levels. Prices have been rising far faster than earnings and that has made it harder and harder for young people to get on to the property ladder.The house-price-to-earnings ratio needs to come down and a period of falling house prices makes that happen. That process is now under way as a result of squeezed living standards, less generous tax treatment for buy-to-let purchases and the prospect of higher interest rates that are all helping to prevent the cost of a home rising. For London specifically, there is also a Brexit effect.To be sure, estate agents are none too keen on the current state of affairs. Philip Hammond would probably like to see stronger housing market activity as well, since it would mean higher tax receipts. But the recurrent house price bubbles of the past four decades have not been good news for the economy. They have caused financial instability, distorted investment decisions and created intergenerational unfairness. Nobody in generation rent struggling to buy their first flat would think for a second that a period of falling prices was bad news.The difficult bit is that there is a sizeable – and vociferous – lobby that is opposed to Britain protecting aid spending when, at home, libraries are being closed, child benefit is being made less generous and the number of bobbies on the beat is dwindling. The rightwing press has long been calling for the Department for International Development (DfID) budget to be cut and it has been emboldened in recent weeks by the Haitian sex scandal that has engulfed Oxfam.Inevitably, this led to a few raised eyebrows. It would certainly be a retrograde step were aid to be used primarily for Britain’s own economic or defence ends, which is what some in the development community fear.There is no reason why this has to be the case. Private sector money is certainly going to be needed to finance Africa’s immense infrastructure requirements. The DfID guarantees that enable ports to be built would be a good use of public money. And if the aid budget can facilitate exports of UK-built wind turbines to Ethiopia, both sides gain.The harsh truth is that there is no viable alternative to Mordaunt’s approach. She can either protect her budget by giving it more of a British flavour or it will be whittled away. In the current difficult circumstances, that’s the choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a23ba403709b21e248cb167b6147b67bca03b9/0_252_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=4750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ffcff317820ddb889c1414c5bebeecc 9500w","title":"best world love letter australia public pools sydney swimming","story":"Tracing his conversion from pool refusnik to aquatic evangelist,  Benjamin Law asks: is swimming the Australian version of baptism?Tracing his conversion from pool refusnik to aquatic evangelist,  Benjamin Law asks: is swimming the Australian version of baptism?In Australia, you’re expected to just know how to swim. It makes sense: more than four in five Australians live within easy walking or driving distance of the sea. As writer Anna Funder recently said of those who call the driest continent on Earth home: “We cling to the edge of the continent, and we swim from a very early age.”Growing up, I hated swimming – which was awful, because I didn’t just grow up in Australia, I grew up in Queensland: the sun-saturated state that gifted us Olympic gods like Kieran Perkins, Susie O’Neill, Grant Hackett and Stephanie Rice, a state where the main trade seemed to be sugar, coal and championship swimmers.You weren’t just expected to know how to swim you were expected to be good at it, too.My parents were Cantonese migrants from Hong Kong who, in the 1970s, moved to Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, home to some of the country’s most beautiful beaches. It still strikes me as a slightly baffling decision, given neither of them could swim. Water compelled and terrified them and their five Australian-born kids.While other people saw stunning coastlines, we just saw a picturesque way to die. Rips could kill you, people said. Sharks could kill you. Skin cancer could kill you. Weirdly, it was always white people who told us these things, the same white people who seemed to keep going to the beach. Were we missing something? Did they want to die?A safer option was the public pool. Years of TV safety campaigns had convinced Mum we needed to know how to swim, because she sure as hell couldn’t save us if we were drowning. Throughout summer, we’d wail as Mum drove us to the nearest suburban leisure centre for lessons. I suspect we dreaded those lessons as much as our instructors dreaded teaching us, those hopeless Asian kids spluttering with anxiety inside the enclosed training pool, those stinking hothouses of chemicals, piss and wet togs (or cossies, or bathers, or swimmers – depending on your state).After the nightmare was over, we’d be sedated with a treat – a Redskin (Australians veer towards racism even with our confectionary), an ice block or a packet of frogs – before falling asleep in the stuffy Ford Cortina, hair matted to our temples, seat belts twisted into our skin and fingers dusted orange from the Twisties we stole from each other.The horror didn’t end there. At school, not only were swimming lessons mandatory, carnivals were too – annual, school-run swim meets, ostensibly fun but deeply competitive. We even had togs in school colours that we had to buy from the uniform shop.During the lessons, I’d watch fit white kids e in and carve through water with graceful limbs that seemed custom-built for the job. Meanwhile, in Lane 1 or 6 – where I could still hold onto the wall – I’d windmill uselessly, my hands banging into the water like saucepans. There was a direct, inverse correlation between the amount of splashing I made and the distance I travelled. At swimming carnivals, all the outcasts were bunched together: the ethnic kid with no body fat (me) pale kids with lots of body fat. We had to swim in an event – any event – so we’d do the novelty race, paddling together on inflatable rafts, damp with chlorine and shame, as everyone cheered and jeered us on. But then, weirdly, I fell in love with swimming. I left home for university, moved to Brisbane and into a rambling architectural mess of a shared house. Its design was … incorrect. It attracted the heat in summer, then trapped it. During heatwaves, my flatmates and I would emerge from our rooms having barely slept and looking boiled. I took refuge from the heat at the Olympic-sized council pool at the bottom of our hill. It didn’t look like much from the outside, but inside it was pure and clean, with a panoramic view of the city skyline. I didn’t have proper togs so I swam in black boxer briefs, hoping no one would notice. After a while, I tried swimming laps.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities.

Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.Alan, the pool manager, took pity on me. “Instead of bashing into the water with your arms like that,” he said, “stretch out like this and twist your entire torso. Instead of exhaling like that, hum and you won’t lose your breath so quickly.” It was homework, and I’d always liked homework. Slowly, I got faster.By the time I moved to Sydney, I owned proper Speedos, goggles and a kickboard. I signed myself up for a 1km charity ocean swim. From some angles it seemed as though I had pecs. Who was this person?I’ve been helped by the fact Sydney has – hands down – the best lap pools in the world. Every inner-city public pool is a wonder in some way. My local, the Prince Alfred Park Pool, is an award-winning architectural miracle built into a hill – like a swimming oasis for hobbits. It’s impossible to take a bad photo of North Sydney Olympic Pool, where the reward for finishing laps is endless Instagram-ready photos of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which towers above the pool like a CGI hallucination. On the other side of the harbour, Andrew “Boy” Charlton Pool is plonked right in the middle of the botanical gardens, decked out like a resort and boasting so many toned men in Speedos, it feels like you’re in the video for Kylie Minogue’s Slow.Even Sydney’s indoor pools – which I usually avoid because of the claustrophobic chlorine pong – are impressive. Ultimo’s dreamy, wave-walled Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (the first Sydney pool I ever swam in) is a Harry Seidler original, a modernist wave of concrete and steel rising from Darling Harbour. In the Cook + Phillip Park Aquatic and Fitness Centre are giant paintings by the Archibald winner Wendy Sharpe, making it one of the few places where you can do laps in an art gallery.For a spiritual experience, it’s all about the ocean baths. On good days, you can swim alongside schools of fish in Wylie’s Baths in Coogee. There’s a reason people rave about Bondi Icebergs, with its sauna overlooking the violent churn of the surf below. And though I’ll never get to visit, I love the idea of Coogee’s McIver’s Ladies Baths, the last remaining women’s-only seawater pool in Australia. Apparently it’s particularly popular with nuns, Muslim women and lesbians I like thinking about the unexpected friendships that have been made there.Is it too far to say swimming is the Australian version of baptism? To me, these places feel sacred to swim in them veers towards sacrament. When I get writer’s block, I swim. When I need space, I swim. When I need company, I swim. When I’m depressed, I swim. When I’m happy, I swim.Last Christmas, my siblings and I – all comically terrible swimmers as kids – laughed at the fact that our eldest sister was now a regular surfer. The remaining four of us now swim regularly in lap pools. Those Asian kids at school, so bad at swimming carnivals that they were constantly disqualified? Well, some of them grew up and now swim  kilometres for leisure. It shouldn’t be surprising – we’re also Australian, after all.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

Braithwaite, a Barbadian-born Briton who arrived here in 1961 when he was nine, was educated here, has worked here for his entire life, married here and had three British children and five British grandchildren. He had been a special needs teaching assistant at a north London primary school for over 15 years when his employers launched a “routine” immigration status check. Braithwaite, 66, assumed correctly that he was British.But now he had to prove it, providing up to four pieces of documentary evidence to the Home Office for every year he had been here. He lost his job when the Home Office failed to issue him with the documents to verify that he was in the country legally. Trying to prove he was who he was, and who nobody ever seriously doubted he always had been, made him ill. “It made me feel like I was an alien. I almost fell apart with the stress,” he said.Within minutes of the article about Braithwaite going online the Home Office had emailed his lawyers to say the documents had been approved. Welcome to the United Kingdom. With the exception of Northern Ireland, our existence as an island means our physical border is, for the most part, well defined. We stop and start at the water’s edge. The entry points, be they at ports or airports, are heavily fortified and highly militarised.But our administrative borders are invisible and omnipresent, iding communities and generations at\u0026nbspwhim and will. These borders represent not a physical space but a political one that can be reproduced without warning in places of learning and healing. At any moment almost anyone, your boss, doctor, child’s headmaster or landlord, can become a border guard – indeed they may be legally obliged to do so – and on the basis of their judgment you may be denied livelihood, family, home and health.Incredibly, this is not a glitch in the system. It is the system. And in the words of American intellectual WEB Du Bois: “A system cannot fail those it was never meant to protect.” Braithwaite has become ensnared in deliberate government policy, set out by the prime minister, Theresa May, when she was home secretary, to create a “really hostile environment for illegal immigrants”. The aim was to make life in Britain so onerous for immigrants that those who could not produce the documents at any, random, point in their daily life, would find their life so difficult that they would, in the words of Mitt Romney, “self-deport”.The acts, implemented first in the year that Ukip won the European elections and then again in the year of the Brexit referendum, were red meat to the grievances of a base that the Tories were losing. We should not be surprised that they are adversely affecting black Britons who have every right to be here, any more than we should have been surprised when there was a rise in Islamophobic attacks following Brexit – even though precious few Muslims in Britain come from elsewhere in Europe.And so it is, 60 years after Windrush brought the symbolic arrival of postwar Caribbean migrants, Braithwaite is one of many who now struggle to justify their existence. There’s Renford McIntyre, 64, who came to\u0026nbspBritain from Jamaica when he was\u0026nbsp14 to join his mum, worked as a tool setter, and is now homeless and unemployed, after he was fired when he couldn’t produce papers to prove his citizenship. Or 61-year-old Paulette Wilson who used to\u0026nbspcook for MPs in the House of Commons. She was put in Yarl’s Wood removal centre and then taken to Heathrow for deportation, before a last-minute reprieve prevented her from being sent to Jamaica, which she last visited when she was 10 and where she has no surviving relatives. Or Albert Thompson, a 63-year-old who came from Jamaica as a teenager and has lived in London for 44 years. He was evicted from his council house and has\u0026nbspnow been denied NHS treatment for his cancer\u0026nbspunless he can stump up £54,000, all because they question his immigration status.Caribbean diplomats have once again called for the Home Office to show compassion. “This is affecting people who came and gave a lifetime of service at a time when the UK was calling for workers and migrants,” explains the Barbados high commissioner, Guy Hewitt. “They came because they were encouraged to come here to help build post-second world war Britain and build it into the multicultural place that it is now.” But if\u0026nbspcompassion is lacking, common sense would do.Even as citizenship tests aim to impart to newcomers the “values of toleration and fair play”, immigration laws have sent longstanding citizens, who have paid their taxes and raised their families here, to homeless shelters or deportation centres because they have not been able to provide paperwork issued more than 40 years ago when they were kids.For, lest we forget, this is also the 50th anniversary of Enoch Powell’s rivers of blood speech: a moment that revealed the galvanising force of populist racism. This mood bleeds effortlessly into immigration policy – the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 was passed the same year, further restricting the future right of entry for former citizens of\u0026nbspthe empire and loosening the connections about which Prince Charles waxed so lyrical. Braithwaite was one of those “charming, wide-grinning piccaninnies” to\u0026nbspwhich Powell so disparagingly referred.Arriving in 1961 (in the same year as my parents and\u0026nbspcoming from the same place) when Barbados was not yet independent, Braithwaite was effectively a British subject when he arrived and his parents would have had passports to that effect. To find himself treated\u0026nbspin this way is not just a violation of natural justice – it is an abdication of Britain’s historical responsibility. Since he arrived before 1973, he has an automatic and permanent right to remain. He has violated no law it is the law that is violating him.• Gary Younge is editor-at-large for the Guardian"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70a8f61eaf08b01eab4e335025135115b53583a7/0_245_5528_3317/master/5528.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3ce1e560ed0fe653a9efbb785a20d2ce 1240w","title":"rugby misogynists public support","story":"How do legends have sex, and who\u0026nbspdo\u0026nbspthey have it with? Perhaps\u0026nbspit’s none of my business, except when these things become public knowledge, it’s because they\u0026nbspare exposed in court.That\u0026nbspword\u0026nbsp“legends” sticks in my\u0026nbspmind. Or rather in my craw. It was in one of the WhatsApp messages read out in court in the Belfast trial of the “star rugby players”, Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding, accused of rape and\u0026nbspunanimously found not guilty last month.The messages discussing what had happened the night before, for which they later apologised, talked\u0026nbspof “shaggers”, of “Belfast sluts”, of “pumping a bird” and “spit-roasting”. Such technical terms had to be\u0026nbspexplained by barristers to the judge and jury, but somehow it was the self-glorifying “Why are we are such legends?” in the players’ WhatsApp group that got me. Legends indeed.I am not sure this is the word they would be using now. This was a high-profile trial in which the woman who had\u0026nbspaccused them of rape had her bloodied knickers\u0026nbsppassed around a courtroom, in which the taxi driver who took her home told of her sobbing, and her distressed texts were also read out. Since the men’s acquittal further details have been released, of a\u0026nbsppornographic video shared with Olding the day after\u0026nbspthe night in question.The jury unanimously acquitted these men of rape.\u0026nbspTheir friends Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison were\u0026nbspunanimously found not guilty of indecent exposure\u0026nbspand of perverting the course of justice. None\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspthese men did anything illegal. Yet they are now\u0026nbspfighting in a different court: the court of public opinion. The widespread disgust at the way that they spoke about\u0026nbspthe woman who they had sex with clings to\u0026nbspthem. It is the nature of what these young men said to\u0026nbspeach other that has appalled so many people and led to\u0026nbspthe creation of the hashtag #IBelieveHer.One wonders about the kind of sex these premier\u0026nbspathletes actually want. This week Otto Putland, a swimmer who\u0026nbsprepresented Wales at the Commonwealth Games,\u0026nbspwas also cleared of rape at Cardiff crown court. He had denied forcing himself on\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspwoman after\u0026nbspshe had\u0026nbspconsensual sex with his friend, the Olympic swimmer Ieuan Lloyd.Does male bonding have to involve the seeming humiliation of women, as it does in some American college fraternities? Is it always a kind of performance that needs to be watched by their mates? In the Belfast trial\u0026nbspwhere a slang expert was brought in to explain “spit–roasting”, the woman spoke of one player penetrating her from behind while another player walked in naked, holding his penis, looking to join in.Footballer Ched Evans, unanimously cleared of rape\u0026nbspin 2016, had sex with a woman in a hotel room following a night out in Rhyl, immediately after his friend Clayton McDonald had had sex with her. Evans\u0026nbspleft via a fire exit without speaking to the woman.\u0026nbspHis younger brother and another man watched\u0026nbspthe encounter through a window.So is this is the ultimate in hyper-masculine male bonding? What is happening when these young sportsmen who know each other’s bodies, whose business is their bodies, choose to enact their\u0026nbspsexual desires in this way?Of course, there is no reason why\u0026nbspsuch\u0026nbspsexual activity should not be consensual, and a lot of pornography indicates that such\u0026nbspencounters are every woman’s\u0026nbspfantasy. Perhaps, though, in such scenarios, the women is the vessel through which these young guys communicate their\u0026nbsppower to each other?These men are not rapists, but they are guilty of\u0026nbsp vile misogyny. None of them presumably has difficulty getting women, who flock to them. To bring\u0026nbspJackson and Olding back on to the rugby field now,\u0026nbspas their supporters are demanding, would appear\u0026nbspto endorse what looks like degrading behaviour. This would hardly be the first time such a thing has happened. But\u0026nbsphow do we teach the boys who admire and emulate sportsmen to respect women if this is how\u0026nbsptheir role models conduct themselves? Talking after his acquittal about the risks of mixing alcohol and sex, Ched Evans said he had been “young” and “stupid” at the time.Is behaviour such as Jackson’s and Olding’s – which some seem willing to write off as high jinks, high-testosterone pranks – in fact best understood as being meant for each other? These men may need an audience for their performances and then to congratulate each other the next day. But is this really living the dream?For that dream, as we have seen, can turn into a nightmare for everyone involved, while a woman can look from the outside as if she is a disposable conduit, not a person in her own right. This is where we still are. And yet there are voices telling us to think about these poor innocent lads whose reputations are ruined. It is shameful.Misogyny is not a crime, clearly, but spare me the suffering of these rugby legends. For them to be portrayed as victims, now? That is truly unbelievable."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds first electrified road for charging vehicles opens in sweden","story":"Stretch of road outside Stockholm transfers energy from two tracks of rail in the road, recharging the batteries of electric cars and trucksThe world’s first electrified road that recharges the batteries of cars and trucks driving on it has been opened in Sweden.About 2km (1.2 miles) of electric rail has been embedded in a public road near Stockholm, but the government’s roads agency has already drafted a national map for future expansion.The technology behind the electrification of the road linking Stockholm Arlanda airport to a logistics site outside the capital city aims to solve the thorny problems of keeping electric vehicles charged, and the manufacture of their batteries affordable.Energy is transferred from two tracks of rail in the road via a movable arm attached to the bottom of a vehicle. The design is not dissimilar to that of a Scalextric track, although should the vehicle overtake, the arm is automatically disconnected.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.comThe electrified road is ided into 50m sections, with an inidual section powered only when a vehicle is above it.When a vehicle stops, the current is disconnected. The system is able to calculate the vehicle’s energy consumption, which enables electricity costs to be debited per vehicle and user.The “dynamic charging” – as opposed to the use of roadside charging posts – means the vehicle’s batteries can be smaller, along with their manufacturing costs.A former diesel-fuelled truck owned by the logistics firm, PostNord, is the first to use the road.Hans Säll, chief executive of the eRoadArlanda consortium behind the project, said both current vehicles and roadways could be adapted to take advantage of the technology.In Sweden there are roughly half a million kilometres of roadway, of which 20,000km are highways, Säll said.“If we electrify 20,000km of highways that will definitely be be enough,” he added. “The distance between two highways is never more than 45km and electric cars can already travel that distance without needing to be recharged. Some believe it would be enough to electrify 5,000km.”At a cost of €1m per kilometre, the cost of electrification is said to be 50 times lower than that required to construct an urban tram line.Säll said: “There is no electricity on the surface. There are two tracks, just like an outlet in the wall. Five or six centimetres down is where the electricity is. But if you flood the road with salt water then we have found that the electricity level at the surface is just one volt. You could walk on it barefoot.”National grids are increasingly moving away from coal and oil and battery storage is seen as crucial to a changing the source of the energy used in transportation. The Swedish government, represented by a minister at the formal inauguration of the electrified road on Wednesday, is in talks with Berlin about a future network. In 2016, a 2km stretch of motorway in Sweden was adapted with similar technology but through overhead power lines at lorry level, making it unusable for electric cars.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Veteran French auteur Godard’s film Le Livre d’Image is a video essay in the style of many of his recent works, while Pawlikowski’s Cold War tells the story of a romance set across multiple countries in the 1950s. Lee, meanwhile, will debut BlacKkKlansman a crime drama about an African American man who infiltrates a Ku Klux Klan chapter, it is likely to be among the most provocative films in this year’s competition. The trio are joined in the race for the Palme d’Or by directors from Egypt, Japan, Lebanon, South Korea and China. Also included in the official selection are films by two dissident directors who have been in conflict with the governments of their homelands: Jafar Panahi, who has been banned from leaving his native Iran, will debut Three Faces, while Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov, who has been under house arrest since 2010 over fraud charges, will debut Leto, a drama about the underground rock and roll scene in Soviet Russia. Cannes festival director Thierry Frémaux urged both Russia and Iran to let the directors attend this year’s event.Another Iranian director, Asghar Farhardi, will open the festival with his film Everybody Knows, a thriller that stars Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem. David Robert Mitchell moves from horror (It Follows) to film noir with Under the Silver Lake, which stars Andrew Garfield while Gomorrah and Tale of Tales director Matteo Garrone will present his “urban western” Dogman.Wim Wenders, meanwhile, will appear out of competition with Francis: A Man of His Word, a behind-the-scenes documentary about Pope Francis’s time as head of the catholic church. The Star Wars spin-off Solo will also premiere out of competition, while Christopher Nolan will present a special 70mm screening of 2001: A Space Odyssey.While the lineup for this year’s festival was global in scope, there was a notable absence of female directors. Only three of the 18 films competing for this year’s Palme d’Or are directed by women, the same number as at last year’s festival, a situation criticised at the time by Cannes jury member Jessica Chastain. Discussing the discrepancy, Frémaux blamed wider issues in the film industry. “There are not enough women directors but we don’t have time to talk about that here. Our point of view is that the films are selected for their intrinsic qualities. There will never be a selection with a positive discrimination for women,” he said. Ahead of what will be the first edition of Cannes since the emergence of sexual misconduct allegations against mogul Harvey Weinstein, a regular attendee at the festival in previous years, Frémaux described the current reckoning over sexual abuse as an “earthquake” moment for both the festival and the industry as a whole. He indicated that the festival would look to change some of its policies in regards to gender equality. “We will discuss equality of salary,” he said. “We want to question our own process about the parity of the juries. The festival director also noted that this year’s festival jury, which will be headed up by Cate Blanchett, would feature more women than men.However, Melissa Silverstein, founder of activist group Women and Hollywood says that Cannes needs to do more to promote female film-makers. “The Cannes Film Festival is arguably the most important film event in the film world outside of the Oscars. When we don’t have enough women-directed films in the lineup the message received is that women are not good enough.“If you pay attention to the film community, all around us, the conversation is shifting, and people are pushing for inclusion. It would be great if the Cannes Film Festival was a part of that,” Silverstein added.Notable too is the absence of several major films that had been tipped for inclusion. There is no place The House That Jack Built, the serial killer drama directed by von Trier. Von Trier had been banned from the festival in 2011 after the director describing himself as “a Nazi” and said that he “understood Hitler”, but had been widely expected to be welcomed back for this year’s event.Also missing is Leigh’s historical epic Peterloo, while Gilliam’s long-awaited comedy The Man Who Killed Don Quixote cannot be screened at the festival due to a legal dispute between Gilliam and one of the movie’s backers.It is possible that one or more of those films will be added to the lineup at a later date, with Frémaux promising more news on Von Trier’s film in “a few days”. However, one name that will definitely absent from this year’s lineup is that of Netflix, with the company’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos announcing on Wednesday that none of the streaming giant’s films would be screening at the festival. The move comes in response to a ruling by Cannes that demands that all films competing for prizes at the festival receive a full theatrical release.The Cannes film festival will be held from 8 to 19 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca6a74227267513c82b8f4241c8f62e0ad5b4b5/0_72_2070_1858/master/2070.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=13cb301270e3bf4c9699f91de66ca40a 1240w","title":"80s films molly ringwald john hughes metoo","story":"Molly Ringwald’s reappraisal of The Breakfast Club has thrown an uneasy light on other 80s classics, with their casual treatment of rape and abuse, dodgy sexual politics and breezy paedophilia. We look at 10 of the worst with fresh eyesEveryone has blind spots when it comes to things they loved as a child: you don’t remember how shonky your favourite toys were, or how weirdly racist your most-adored first books could be. Partly, this is because you encountered these things as a child and so didn’t think to question them, but it’s also because you don’t want to question them, because questioning them means rewriting your happiest memories.This is probably why John Hughes has got a free pass for so long. Many of us who are now adults grew up with his films and cherished them with the fond sentimentality French novelists reserve for madeleines. He is – rightly – held up as the man who brought a soulfulness to the teen genre, but that was never Hughes’s full story, really. So when Molly Ringwald, who starred in three of his teen movies, wrote in the New Yorker this week about rewatching those films in the #MeToo era and pointed out that, actually, Hughes’s teen films have some distinctly unsoulful elements to them, it was, for fans, as if the emperor’s most devoted courtier had pointed out his (semi) nudity. Ringwald cites 16 Candles in particular, although with its rapiness and racism, that movie has been pretty unwatchable for a while now, surviving only on nostalgia. But she also talks about The Breakfast Club, a film still genuinely so beloved that a restaurant chain is named after it. Yet the school thug (Judd Nelson) is vicious to Ringwald’s character throughout the film, even looking up her skirt in one scene and poking her in the vagina, and still she swoons into his arms at the end.I have never loved The Breakfast Club, mainly because it is so weird about the two female teen characters: one gets together with her bully and the other (Ally Sheedy) has to have a makeover to be deemed socially acceptable. Hughes adored and respected Ringwald, but this only comes across in their last – and, uncoincidentally, best – film, Pretty in Pink.Films from the 80s have lasted amazingly well, considering some are now almost 40 years old. But there is no doubt social attitudes have changed, particularly post #MeToo. Some clunkingly dated examples are obvious: everyone knows that Fatal Attraction is completely ridiculous about single women, and nobody watches 9½ Weeks for a healthy depiction of sexual politics. But it’s the creepy jokes and weird dynamics that can really make the heart sink.Yet, as Ringwald rightly says, pointing out the flaws does not mean you have to disown it. It is part of being a grownup, as much as suddenly seeing your parents’ fallibilities and still loving them. You love things from the past with the heart of a child, but you can simultaneously see them through the eyes of an adult.The ultimate example of a story idea that should have been made as a horror film but was somehow instead written up as a romantic comedy. A handyman (Kurt Russell) lies to a woman with amnesia (Goldie Hawn) and tells her she is his wife just so she will clean his house, look after his kids and, ultimately, have sex with him. “Does she run in the opposite direction when she finds out the truth?” SPOILER! She does not. Russell and Hawn famously have one of the stablest relationships in Hollywood, so you have to wonder how they looked at this script and thought, “Yup, that seems normal – sign us up!”Yes, Tess (Melanie Griffith) is celebrated for being ambitious. Look, she swaps her trainers for heels under her desk! But she is also depicted as a kind of babyish sex doll, one who girlishly defers to her men (Alec Baldwin and then Harrison Ford) and talks in the voice of a child. She can only progress up the ladder not by fighting sexism, but by tearing down another woman, the pointedly very adult Katharine (Sigourney Weaver), who is mocked for worrying about her fertility, physically humiliated and finally banished. Working Girl was certainly not the only 80s film to be conflicted about feminism and full of contradictory messages to women, but the fact it is still celebrated as a feminist classic makes its weirdness all the weirder.I love Ghostbusters, you love Ghostbusters, we all love Ghostbusters. But let’s be honest, Venkman (Bill Murray) is a total creep. In his opening scene he is literally giving electric shocks to one of his male students just so he can try to sleep with a female student, and then he later barges into Dana’s (Sigourney Weaver) apartment when she specifically didn’t want him to come over. Look, I didn’t want to accept this either, and for a while I convinced myself that Venkman proves himself to be a good guy when he resists having sex with Dana even though she is possessed by the demon of a horny dog and begs him to do so. But if your bar for male goodness is not taking advantage of a woman who is actually a dog, your bar is probably too low.There are some 80s films that haven’t lasted but really should have done: Crossing Delancey and Lucas, for example, are stone-cold classics that no one watches now when they absolutely should, ideally every day. And then there are films that have had a longevity that baffles even the most devoted 80s fans. Mannequin is one such film. Yes, Andrew McCarthy’s smile is so magical it should be a Unesco-protected tourist site, and yes, the film does get bonus points for the presence of Estelle Getty, AKA Dorothea from The Golden Girls. But that does not change the fact this is a romantic comedy about a man who falls in love with a plastic doll. The perfect woman, it turns out, is one who only comes to life when given permission to do so. At least 2007’s Lars and the Real Girl, starring Ryan Gosling, admits the weirdness of this man-and-doll set-up. Mannequin, however, plays it purely for romance, and not even the always-welcome presence of Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now by Starship on the soundtrack changes the wrongness of this film.Arguably the greatest teen film of all time and definitely the greatest John Cusack film ever (don’t even try, High Fidelity and Grosse Pointe Blank fans). I love this film so much I used a quote from it to open one of my books (“The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don’t be a guy”.) And yet I also accept it can also be seen as exemplifying the long-established truth that films romanticise harassment and stalking. The film opens with Lloyd (Cusack) claiming he once went on a date with Diane (Ione Skye) because he sat near her while eating in the mall, which sounds, let’s be frank, kinda stalkery. Later, Lloyd, freshly dumped, stands outside Diane’s window and plays the song (In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel) to which he and she once had sex. This may well be the most awweww moment ever committed to celluloid, and it only falls on the aww side of the former thanks to Cusack’s Cusackiness.The 80s were so full of bodyswap films they became a genre unto themselves: 18 Again!, Vice-Versa, Like Father Like Son, All of Me, Dream a Little Dream, and I am not ashamed to say I have seen them all, yes, even the one in which Judge Reinhold swaps bodies with Fred Savage. Twice. No, YOU had a wasted youth. Big is so superior to all those other bodyswap films it’s pretty much in a different universe, which is why you have seen it 17 times and had never before heard of Vice-Versa. But in one respect it falls victim to the genre’s cliche in having the child-in-the-body-of-a-man have sex with a grown woman who has no idea who she is actually sleeping with. And sure, Tom Hanks carries off the scene with sweet panache, staring dazedly at his girlfriend Susan’s (Elizabeth Perkins) bra, but it is still a 13-year-old having sex with a thirtysomething. Things reach peak weirdness when Susan drops him back off at his mother’s and watches him turn back into a little boy. She smiles lovingly at his 13-year-old face, remarkably unbothered that she should now be arrested for paedophilia. Heartwarming!This may well be the greatest Christmas film of all time, but it is also part of a different genre we can call the 80s Anti-Feminism Movie. It’s a pretty packed genre: there was Mr Mom (by, yes, John Hughes), which warned that women going out to work would destroy the nuclear family, and let’s not even get started, please, on Fatal Attraction. Die Hard is subtler than both of those films, but it definitely fits in. John McClane (Bruce Willis) has come to LA from New York because his wife, Holly, dared to want to take a big job there, even though, as McClane stresses early on, this destroyed their marriage. He is disgusted when he arrives at her office to hear everyone call her by her maiden name, and her office is full of coked-up sleazeballs and terrorists, emphasising how wrong Holly’s choice was. But don’t worry, by the end of the film she is tamed and she insists, to her husband’s delight, to be addressed as “Mrs McClane”. That’s right, Bruce. You keep the little woman in line.Strictly speaking, this is a 70s film, as it came out in 1979, but given I saw it in the 80s I’m including it. And when I saw it, when I was eight, I thought this was the funniest film anyone could ever and would ever make. Directed by Ivan Reitman, co-written by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray in his first starring film role, Meatballs, about a rather unorthodox summer camp, can be seen as the early comedy prototype for Ghostbusters, given how many crucial cast and crew members of the two films overlapped. And, like Ghostbusters, it has definite weirdness in it that you can overlook as a kid but will wince at as an adult. Murray plays Tripper, a very Murray-ish camp counsellor, who torments the kids, flirts with the women and is goofily aggressive to the woman he actually likes, Roxanne (Kate Lynch), a fellow counsellor. In one scene, he makes a move on Roxanne and by “makes a move” I mean chases her around his office while she tries to fight him off, pushes her to the ground and the whole scene is, to use the technical term, totally rapey. In short, the lesson of Murray’s early comedies is, a man could get away with a lot of gross behaviour on screen, if he was Bill MurrayThese days nerds are seen as charming, rumpled, cool and even a bit sexy. Back in the 80s, they were generally depicted as voyeuristic sex pests, peering into the girls’ changing room through their taped-up glasses, and no film exemplified this more than Revenge of the Nerds. But in case you ever get asked in a pub quiz what was the rapiest film of the 1980s, this is the official answer.Life Moves Pretty Fast by Hadley Freeman (Fourth Estate, £8.99).

He has blown in like a strange force of nature, with a coolly amoral plan to use their mutual hate to his own gunslinging advantage. Striding towards a gunfight, he tells the coffin-maker in advance how many to knock up.This is the 1964 movie, now on rerelease, which created the revolutionary new genre of the Spaghetti Western, an Italian coproduction shot in Spain and directed with inspirational pulp passion by Sergio Leone –drawing on Kurosawa. And it made a star and a legend of Clint Eastwood. He had been the impetuous young Rowdy Yates on TV’s Rawhide, an open-faced boy with a pleasant singing voice. In this movie, he suddenly, terrifyingly grew up: hat, poncho, grizzly growth of beard, short cigar, eyes perpetually screwed up, as if staring into the sun or suppressing a grimace of incredulous disgust. The Man With No Name and the brutal Dollars movies were a colossal rebuke to the blander Rawhide-style westerns that had come to dominate television.The other figure that became a legend here was composer Ennio Morricone, for his extraordinary musical score – sometimes with plaintive and slightly nasal trumpets that declaimed his robust Aranjuez-type pastiche, and sometimes the main theme with its whip-poor-will whistling cries, whip-cracks, bells and eerie percussive shouts. The blaringly dubbed dialogue from bit-part players adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The Man With No Name (he acquires the name “Joe” from the locals, apparently an all-purpose term for gringos) arrives and instantly sizes up the way the local Rojo brothers are psychotically bullying a small child, who has been taken away from his mother, Marisol (Marianne Koch), because one of the brothers has conceived a fanatically possessive attachment to this woman. This is the hateful bandit Ramón (Gian Maria Volontè), who has a sensual face that often looms sweatily in Leone’s many melodramatic closeups – like a cross between Omar Sharif and Laurence Olivier.His is the crew which has audaciously kidnapped and killed members of the US army and, disguised in their uniforms, tricked the Mexican army into handing over a huge amount in gold in return for a promised consignment of rifles. The deal ends in slaughter. Ranged against the Rojo gang are the Baxters – anglos who are every bit as violent, and also pompous and pusillanimous. Eastwood’s nameless avenger somehow manages to use one against the other, but shows a human side, of a sort, in his laconic friendship with the bar owner Silvanito (José Calvo) and his gallant rescue of Marisol.Finally, he will materialise as if from a dust storm with what looks like a supernatural invulnerability to bullets, though keen to dispute Ramón’s belief that a Winchester repeating rifle will always be better than a .45 pistol. And he achieves that all-important ronin asceticism, a need only to keep moving on, although that thousand dollars has in fact made him very rich. A Fistful of Dollars has a cult, comic-book intensity. It is the punk rock of westerns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06e9b1917306db9d677cc57f9f653e0f88337771/121_238_2682_1609/master/2682.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b32bc55d5935723cf6138f7ce04631b2 1240w","title":"harry kane mauling social media pochettino","story":"• Goal award attracted comment from Golden Boot rival Mo Salah• Fans of other clubs will have killed him, Spurs manager addsMauricio Pochettino believes Harry Kane will “learn a lot” from the controversy over Tottenham’s second goal against Stoke last Saturday. Spurs chose to appeal a decision to award the goal to Christian Eriksen, after Kane claimed the Dane’s free-kick touched his shoulder on the way into the net.The Premier League goals accreditation panel this week upheld the complaint and gave the goal to Kane. Pochettino said the process had not caused any tension in his camp and insisted he trusts Kane, who is an “honest” player.The Spurs manager did admit, however, that the strength of the public response – which include messages on social media from Mo Salah, Kane’s rival for the Golden Boot – had caught the striker by surprise. “Of course, he never thought that this situation would escalate, when he was so certain that he touched the ball,” Pochettino said. “After the game Harry said he touched the ball with a shoulder, he told Christian. I think Harry is a very honest person, he’s not going to lie about this situation. It’s not a big issue for the team.“People have opinions, but that is normal. He was disappointed because he never wanted to create this. Sometimes it can seem a simple thing, and then it becomes big and you can’t stop it. That is what happened here. I think he is going to learn a lot from this you know.”Spurs play Manchester City at Wembley on Saturday with Kane hoping to close the gap on Salah in the race to be the ision’s top scorer. Kane has 25 Premier League goals to the Egyptian’s 29.When asked if the week’s activity might provide extra motivation for Salah, however, Pochettino replied: “If Salah needs this situation to inspire him? Come on, you make me laugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fdd791d6ce0d10de3a930c5d07480b2e625d85e/13_45_2531_1519/master/2531.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d66c63bf8d0ca941d0aadf1ad4460c06 1240w","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Spurs aim to give City the jitters, Newcastle could profit from Arsenal’s poor away form, and Burnley can close in on EuropeLong after Manchester City win the Premier League at a canter, the utterly futile and unwinnable debate will continue to rage over whether a season in which they won two trophies but came up well short in their quest for the Holy Grail of the Champions League can be considered a success. While a fourth consecutive defeat across two competitions would provide no shortage of grist to the mill of reactionary halfwits who have already written off this season as a failure, it is unlikely to be a source of too much concern for many Manchester City fans. Nevertheless, should the gap between themselves and Manchester United be reduced to 10 points (11 if you include the massive gulf in goal difference) with five games to play, there will almost certainly be City fans of a certain vintage who start experiencing mild but all too familiar feelings of discomfort. On a weekend in which the Grand National is arguably the sporting highlight, it is inconceivable that even a club with City’s proud tradition of spectacular pratfalls could somehow do a Devon Loch on this particular run-in. Inconceivable, but not impossible – as Roy Keane famously observed of his former club’s cross-town rivals, “it is in their DNA to mess things up”. BGMark Hughes’s task over the next week is to start saving Southampton’s season by ruining Chelsea’s. Winning at St Mary’s on Saturday, and at Wembley on Sunday week, would shatter the lingering top-four hopes of Antonio Conte’s men and knock them out of the FA Cup. But how to do it? Hughes’s introduction of a back five worked quite well for Southampton at Arsenal last weekend, but Jack Stephens’s late red card in that match makes the option more risky this weekend. Deploying three central defenders would entail reassigning several players or giving a first league start of the season to young Polish centre-back Jan Bednarek. PDCrystal Palace entertain Brighton this weekend and the corresponding league and FA Cup fixtures between the two have already generated plenty of talking points this season. A stronger than usual police presence is likely at Selhurst Park following the ugly scenes which marred November’s top flight stalemate and led to the Sussex constabulary issuing an apology to travelling Crystal Palace fans they’d falsely accused of being tooled up and looking for trouble. When Brighton knocked Palace out of the FA Cup six weeks later, Glenn Murray’s late winner prompted what would be among the first of many increasingly tedious debates surrounding the use of VAR. Four points clear of perilously-placed Palace but not yet assured of survival, Brighton fans would like nothing more than to see their club secure safety and plunge their bitter – if unlikely – rivals further into the mire. A feisty encounter seems assured, both on and off the field. BGManchester United will be greeted like returning heroes at Old Trafford when they host West Brom on Sunday. It’s their first match since the comeback against Manchester City that may empower them to challenge for the title next season. A feelgood mood needs to be fed and watered however, and United should therefore aim not just to beat the league’s bottom side, but batter them. A swaggering performance would reinforce the hope that something changed last weekend. United’s last six games of this season are all winnable – the toughest is Arsenal at home – and they could end up with 89 points. That would be 19 more than their best season tally since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement. But the most relevant progress is measured by the kind of feeling a statistic can never provide the kind they had at the Etihad last weekend. Sunday’s match will give the first indication whether that was a glorious one-off or something more profound. RSBurnley take on Leicester in the kind of contest once comically described by Harry Redknapp as “the scramble to avoid qualifying for the Europa League”. Whoever finishes in seventh place will qualify for Europe’s second-tier competition next season – provided Southampton do not win the FA Cup – and Sean Dyche’s team are currently in the box-seat ahead of Leicester. Despite Redknapp’s commendable cynicism, it is difficult to imagine Burnley fans being anything but excited by the prospect of a first foray into European competition since their Fairs Cup quarter-final in 1967. Harbingers of doom will suggest an attritional European campaign, and the early start to the season that comes with it, could stretch Burnley’s already meagre resources to snapping point and lead to a relegation battle next season. That may be so, but Burnley under Dyche are nothing if not resilient and are unlikely to provide any evidence at Turf Moor this weekend that they consider the prospect of competing in the Europa League next season beneath them. BGIf Carlsberg made football matches, they would want bugger all to do with Swansea v Everton on Saturday. That said, this is a huge match for the hosts. They won five of their first nine league games under Carlos Carvalhal, a spectacular run that more than doubled their points total. But the last three matches have brought only two points, and they even – the horror! – failed to beat West Brom last weekend. Although there’s no need to panic yet, this game against an Everton side with an abysmal away record (two wins in 16 games) has the look of a fork in the road. If they win, Swansea will surely be safe if they lose, they may start to worry that they began their great escape too early. Their next two games are against Manchester City and Chelsea. Then, after a trip to Bournemouth, they end the season with matches at home to Southampton and Stoke – the two teams desperate to drag them back into the relegation filth they seemed to have escaped. RSEddie Howe might have hoped that, with a Champions League semi-final on the horizon, Jürgen Klopp would give Mo Salah a rest this weekend. But Harry Kane has probably banjaxed that wish. The Egyptian used Twitter this week to express his surprise at the decision by the Premier League to award England’s darling striker the goal that Denmark’s Christian Eriksen appeared to score at Stoke – and Salah will likely be motivated to give a more emphatic reaction on Saturday. He is currently four goals ahead of Kane in the race for the Premier League’s golden boot and will no doubt be dead set on extending that lead if he plays on Saturday. James Milner, meanwhile, deserves a rest. Salah should take penalties in his absence. PDFew sets of fans find themselves face to face with Rudyard Kipling’s two imposters of triumph and disaster with such monotonous regularity as those who follow Newcastle. Right now the pendulum has swung towards the “decidedly upbeat” end of the scale. Their Premier League status has been all but assured, prompting reports that the possibility of a takeover is back on the boardroom table. And if the prospect of ridding their club of Mike Ashley isn’t enough to prompt goofy grins across the Gallowgate End, that of their bitter rivals Sunderland being relegated to League One certainly is. Arsenal visit St James’ Park this weekend, having won just three league matches on the road this season. Indeed, they go to Newcastle on the back of consecutive away defeats at the hands of Brighton, Tottenham, Swansea and Bournemouth. With Arsenal eyes firmly focused on a bigger Europa League prize, this constitutes a free swing for a buoyant Newcastle who must be fancied to end a run of 10 consecutive defeats at the hands of their visitors. BGHuddersfield have five matches left from which to gain enough points to remain clear of the trapdoor. The last three of those are against Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal. While we should not discount the possibility of David Wagner’s team beating those sides, whose minds could be anywhere by the time they play, the probability is that Huddersfield are going to have to get the points they need in their next two matches, at home to Watford and Everton. If Saturday’s match against Watford is not must-win, it is at least a “could very much do with winning”. Huddersfield prevailed 4-1 at Vicarage Road in December and Watford have not managed to even score in their last six away matches. They are the sort of visitors who will surely fall if Wagner’s team can rediscover the vibrancy they regularly showed at home earlier in the campaign. PDIt is usually promising youngsters who stake a late claim to go to the World Cup. Joe Hart, 30 years old and with 75 England caps, could put a new spin on an old theme in the next few weeks. The Zlatanic influence of Marko Arnautovic has been West Ham’s main on-field focus of late, but Hart has quietly made an impressive return to the side. His performance at Chelsea, when he made three extremely good saves, had an authority that brought to mind his best years at Manchester City. It’s too early proclaim that he is back, but he has an opportunity that did not exist a month ago. An immaculate end to the season would probably get him in the England squad maybe even the team.

Arsenal were rocking and CSKA Moscow raucous but there was Welbeck, burning away from a panting Kirill Nababkin on the left flank, eating up 50 yards of turf and offering a self-made opportunity on the counter. His centre, scuffed and misdirected with team-mates waiting, was poor and at that moment it was tempting to wonder whether Arsenal, who had rarely reached anything like that speed in the previous 65 minutes, would pay the ultimate price for not working through the gears a little sooner.Instead Welbeck came again, having Nababkin on toast once more en route to a sweet combination with Mohamed Elneny for the game’s killer goal. Arsenal’s throng of several hundred supporters, flung up in the gods of the stand at the far end, had been given advance notice after all and Welbeck grew further into his unlikely role as Europa League relaxant, first earned as Milan threatened to have fun at the Emirates a month ago.His status seems fitting to what has been a strange path to the semi-finals for Arsenal: a singular mixture of near-apathy, eccentricity and exhilaration, blended into a concoction that all seems rather familiar. This, though, felt like one of the more life-affirming football occasions of their European campaign even if, having hardly been dealt a blow by CSKA for the first 39 minutes, they should not have given the night a chance to take such a perilous course. So much of the attention before this return fixture, with the tie seemingly wrapped up in north London, had been on off-pitch concerns in the event both teams left the pitch with applause reverberating and the only discomfort for anyone connected to the visiting side had come in the half-hour or so of play after Fedor Chalov’s opening goal.Local security forces had left little to chance in the buildup. An estimated 2,000 police and security officers were pressed into action those positioned inside the nearby CSKA metro station, a shiny facility that opened this year and houses imposing statues of sporting heroes from the club’s past, would have heard as much Russian as English being spoken by many of the Arsenal fans who passed through. The local branch of Arsenal’s support were out in force it added to a mixed, entirely non-confrontational environment that ended up feeling more like a celebration of what continental competition ought to be than an acid test of a World Cup host’s ability to avoid disaster.That was how it had been billed in some quarters, though, and the problem with acknowledging the occasion’s smooth running is that, in doing so, one runs the risk of legitimising the hyperbole. Liverpool and Manchester United had both come and gone from Moscow with little fanfare just six and a half months previously, after all the likelihood of escalating diplomatic tensions emboldening a hardcore hooligan element to court trouble always seemed remote but perhaps the evening will have served a useful purpose if it leads some of the pre-World Cup hysteria to be dialled down.The only frenzied scenes came in the stands, where a section of CSKA’s ultras performed their customary shirt removal during the period of the second half when Arsenal themselves risked being stripped naked. It was a relentlessly positive vibe and that continued into the post-match press conference, where the likeable home coach Viktor Goncharenko was applauded out of the room by an appreciative local media who saw a technical, mobile side put up a far more coherent all-round performance than it had a week previously.It was Welbeck’s ability to smooth out his own rough edges that made the difference in the end, though, and Arsenal move on to what will – for all CSKA’s flourishes, led by the excellent Aleksandr Golovin – surely be a sterner test in the semi-finals. The most perplexing of seasons is lurching towards a showdown, perhaps decisive for Arsène Wenger’s future, in Lyon. Wenger said afterwards that Welbeck “has that extra motivation that he can give you something special”. Those are not words he has had the chance to ponder often but together, in their unorthodox way, player and team made sure they were the only story here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43aa1715ad36aee694d4fbbe76f809d5039da2fe/1345_1100_3791_3792/master/3791.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=57f8294da13d2768d2d11ba93f86e11f 1240w","title":"felicity cloake masterclass mayonnaise recipe","story":"Back away from the shop-bought stuff and make a mayo to remember with these easy stepsWith a few exceptions, commercial mayonnaise is to homemade as processed cheese is to mature cheddar – convenient, but hard to get excited about. Proper mayo, gently wobbly and yolk-yellow, is a quite different beast: too good to hide away in a sandwich, it deserves to be the star of the show, served with crunchy baby veg, fresh seafood or just a big pile of hot, salty chips.1 egg yolk1 big pinch salt1 tbsp dijon mustard1 tbsp white-wine or cider vinegar, or lemon juice250ml light olive, grape seed, sunflower or other neutral oil25ml extra-virgin olive, walnut or rapeseed oilEnsure everything is at room temperature before you get going. This makes the finished product much less likely to split. So, if you keep your eggs in the fridge, take them out at least 30 minutes before you start work.This small amount of mayonnaise is hard to make in most food mixers, but electric beaters will do the trick, as will a whisk and a bit of elbow grease. You will also need a large, sturdy bowl. If you happen to have a stick blender and a tall jug in which it fits snugly, go to step 7.Put a damp cloth under the bowl to anchor it, then put the egg yolk and salt in the bowl. Whisk for about 20 seconds, until slightly thickened, then add the mustard and acid (and a teaspoon of cold water if you’re nervous, though it’s not strictly necessary). Whisk for another 30 seconds. Familiarise yourself with step 6 before going any further.Begin to add the oil into the bowl, drop by painstaking drop, whisking all the time. Don’t be tempted to use extra-virgin olive oil, because this will make a heavy, often bitter mayonnaise, especially if you’re using electric beaters. It’s far better, and cheaper, to start with a neutral oil and add some extra-virgin at the end.Keep whisking and pouring until the mayonnaise begins to thicken, at which point you can begin to add the oil more quickly, followed by a second, more flavourful oil, if you like. Once all 275ml of the oil has been incorporated and you have a thick, glossy mixture, season to taste. If you’d prefer a thinner consistency, beat in a little water, lemon juice or vinegar.If your mayonnaise splits, it’s easily rescued, as long as you have another egg yolk. Crack this into a fresh bowl, whisk for a minute until thick and sticky, then gradually beat in the split mayonnaise a little at a time, followed by any remaining oil.If you have a stick blender, put all the ingredients except the extra-virgin olive oil into a jug just slightly wider than the blender head. Plunge the blender down to the base of the jug, then turn on and, keeping the blender still, blend on high power for 10 seconds, until you can see the mixture start to emulsify.Once the mayonnaise begins to billow out from the sides of the blender, very slowly move the head upwards through the oil until you have a creamy mayonnaise (repeat this process, if necessary). Beat in the extra-virgin olive oil by hand, then season to taste.Mayonnaise is easy to tailor to need or occasion: fold in a clove of crushed garlic, or a handful of chopped herbs, the zest of an unwaxed lemon, black pepper, chilli sauce, horseradish or wasabi, smoked paprika and lime juice, crumbled blue cheese and chives, curry powder, finely chopped capers anchovies or cornichons, wholegrain mustard – but preferably not all at once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb8e4245e683c703eb722af6978719efdb671cdf/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4d6db19fddb35dd028bc204a07afcc5f 2600w","title":"ultra processed truth 10 bestselling foods cherry bakewell fray bentos pies","story":"From Cherry Bakewells to Fray Bentos pies, do we really understand the cocktail of ingredients in our favourite brands? Nutritionists assess them – and just what they might mean for our healthAs the saying goes: if your granny wouldn’t have recognised what’s in it, it’s probably not real food. Yet half the food we take home is made in factories from a list of ingredients and additives as long as your arm, most of which never found a place in any grandparents’ kitchen cupboard – and wouldn’t in yours or mine today.We are a nation of ultra-processed-food eaters. Our lives have become too fast-paced to cook from scratch and our tastebuds now crave the sweet and salty flavours that ultra-processed foods deliver. Our bread is fluffy and sticks to the teeth like candyfloss. Our yoghurts are super-sweet and creamy. We have ready meals that are shelf-stable (long life without refrigeration), which we can prise open, heat, eat and go.Nutritionists are alarmed. The ultra-processed foods we tend to eat now are calorie-dense and a major contribution to obesity. They have also been stripped of bioactive compounds such as phytoestrogens and fibre, which we know are good for us. All we get is calories (and occasionally added vitamins). And although inidually they are all approved for safety, we have no idea what effect the cocktail of additives might have on us in the long term.The nutritionist Dr Courtney Scott from the Food Foundation says it costs less to fill up hungry kids on ultra-processed foods than fresh. “For £1 worth of spinach, say, you can get 60 calories. For £1 worth of apples you get 307 calories. For £1 of turkey dinosaurs, you’re getting 730 calories. It is not surprising that the foods that are palatable – they are full of salt and sugar and fat – and that are calorie-rich for a low price are the ones that we’re consuming the most of,” she says.A group of international scientists has produced what they call the Nova definition of four classes of food, from fruit and vegetables in their natural state to ultra-processed, which are, they say, “industrial formulations typically with five or more and usually many ingredients”. These include “substances not commonly used in culinary preparations”, and contain additives “whose purpose is to imitate sensory qualities” of natural foods such as fruit. They are, says Prof Carlos Monteiro from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, “intrinsically unhealthy”.His collaborator Prof Jean-Claude Moubarac, from the department of nutrition at the University of Montreal, Canada, goes further. These foods cause social and cultural damage, he says. “They promote overconsumption and a relationship to food that is characterised by compulsion, stress and anxiety.”We looked at what is actually in 10 of Britain’s favourites, choosing a top seller from 10 categories of packaged foods tracked by Euromonitor International. What is the country eating?Bernard Matthews did not respond to requests for comment.Scott says she did a double take at this list of ingredients. “Unfortunately, there is no chicken or mushroom in the chicken and mushroom sauce. There is chicken fat and there is mushroom juice concentrate,” she says. The mushroom juice concentrate will have had the fibre and vegetable micronutrients pounded out of it in the industrial process.Premier Foods, which makes Batchelors and also Mr Kipling cakes, says: “Processing plays a very important role in food safety and preservation. We recognise the importance of healthy lifestyles and balanced choices, and continually work on developing increasingly healthy and convenient options for consumers, as well as having an increased focus on positive nutrients such as fibre and protein.”Drying foods was one of the oldest preservation methods, they say. “Batchelors Pasta ’n’ Sauce is low in fat, has no added MSG and no artificial colours or preservatives.”A gold star for anyone who knows how surimi is made. It does contain Alaska pollock – but not whole slices or chunks of fish, just the protein it is fish that has been mechanically beaten and pulverised to a paste. As it is tasteless and shapeless, sugar is added, followed by a host of additives – two forms of starch and some shellfish bits and flavour enhancers – so it can be formed into a solid, fishy-tasting stick.Young’s said it would not be able to comment.There is no veg. “Fresh foods rich in bioactive compounds (flavonoids, for instance), including onions, garlic and other foods used in freshly prepared dishes are absent from these products,” says Monteiro. “Being ready-to-eat products, it is unlikely they will be consumed with fresh foods that usually need preparation. On the contrary, one ultra-processed food tends to be consumed with other ultra-processed foods.”Xanthan gum is not from an exotic tree. It is fermented sugar. The name comes from the type of bacteria used. It is a stabiliser to bind together ingredients such as fat and water that would otherwise repel each other.Fray Bentos did not respond to requests for comment.“As far as we’re concerned, the industrial loaf with all its additives isn’t actually bread,” says Chris Young of the Real Bread Campaign. It is calling for an Honest Crust Act to legally define “sourdough”, “artisan”, “wholegrain” and “craft”, as well as “fresh” and “freshly baked”, and to make manufacturers list all their ingredients – some are left out on the basis that they are just part of the processing.The launch of the Chorleywood Process in 1961 changed the UK’s bread drastically. This was the discovery of how to go from a pile of flour to sliced, plastic-wrapped bread in three to four hours, using lower-protein wheat, vitamin C, fat, yeast and high-speed mixers. Bread gained additives, “relaxants to overcome the stress of the machine and then tighteners again”, Young says. “It was a milestone – or tombstone – in the history of bread.”A Warburtons spokesperson says bread is one of the UK’s main sources of dietary fibre. “It is misleading to consider mass-produced bread an ‘ultra-processed food’. We bake it fresh, every day, using the same methods you would at home. However, in order to meet demand and ensure that we are able to produce affordable products for our consumers, we do this on a much larger scale.”There is lots of sugar in this, predictably – and not just sugar (twice) but glucose-fructose syrup. Dried skimmed milk will also be sweet. The digestives also contain palm oil, much used in ultra-processed foods. “Health-wise, palm oil is not fantastic because it is a highly saturated fat. It is being used instead of trans fats, which used to be commonly found in this type of product,” says Scott. “From a nutritional perspective, we’ve swapped one particularly unhealthy fat for one that isn’t particularly good for you either.” There are also concerns about the environmental impact of farming and harvesting palm oil.McVitie’s says it provides transparent information so people can make healthy snacking choices. “Biscuits are simply baked by combining a few ingredients. They are a source of fibre and adhere to strict nutrition guardrails,” it says.A spokesman from Müller says: “We are fully aligned with the view that a balanced diet and lifestyle is important, but we also believe that it should be permissible for people to enjoy moments of pleasure, which is what this product offers.”Sugar is the second ingredient here – 11g per 30g serving. From a nutritional perspective, maize and sugar are going to be very quickly digested. There is not a lot of fibre to slow the process down, so you are likely to feel hungry sooner. “In addition to it being very sweet and reinforcing that sweet palate, nutritionally this isn’t going to stay with you for very long,” says Scott.Kellogg’s says it provides a variety of convenient, nutritious and high-quality foods, all of which can play a role in a healthy, balanced diet. “Multiple studies have shown that people who start the day with a cereal breakfast tend to weigh less and have improved nutrient intakes,” says a spokesperson, pointing to the added vitamins.Ingredients: flour (with added calcium, iron, niacin, thiamin), sugar, vegetable oils (palm, rapeseed), plum and raspberry jam (glucose-fructose syrup, plum puree, sugar, raspberry puree, gelling agent (pectin), acid (citric acid), acidity regulator (sodium citrates), colour (anthocyanins), preservative (potassium sorbate), flavouring), glucose syrup, glace cherries (cherries, sugar, acidity regulator (citric acid), preservatives (potassium sorbate, sulphur dioxide), colour (cochineal), sweetened condensed skimmed milk (skimmed milk, sugar), ground rice, desiccated coconut (contains preservative (sodium metabisulphite (sulphites), whey powder (milk), dried egg white, ground almonds, salt, dextrose, emulsifiers (sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60), raising agents (disodium diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate), milk proteins, humectant (vegetable glycerine), flavouring, preservative (potassium sorbate).“There’s a bit of flour and it’s fortified – OK. A tiny, tiny bit of fruit in the form of raspberry and plum puree. This is a far cry from eating a raspberry or a plum.”Premier Foods says: “Mr Kipling Cherry Bakewells contain no hydrogenated fats, and no artificial colours or flavours.”Cadbury has MILK in capitals on the Dairy Milk ingredients list, stressing that it has plenty of real milk as well as real cocoa solids in its chocolate. It also has emulsifiers and flavourings – as well as cheap palm oil – that you wouldn’t have in the kitchen cupboard. These are engineered to give the right silky mouthfeel for a chocolate bar.Cadbury did not respond to requests for comment.“In this environment, it’s really not surprising that we’ve ended up in the situation where half of our calories are coming from ultra-processed foods,” Scott says. Like other food campaigners, she wants TV advertising bans before 9pm and a clampdown on promotions – and some way of making healthy food as cheap as the factory-made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538b55f633d993bdf8e3852ff47b308b0fe786df/0_357_2764_1658/master/2764.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1d8afc799dd86f1ab4547f25dddd38cb 1240w","title":"cricket amateur professional player rules asylum seeker","story":"Because he played for his national team in Afghanistan it says he can’t play for usI help run an amateur cricket club which, last year, welcomed a young asylum seeker from Afghanistan. He was keen to get involved in the sport and make new friends. None of our players are paid or funded in any way. He has a Home Office registration card and has not left the UK since his arrival in January 2017. He previously played cricket in Afghanistan for the national team at junior levels and attended the national men’s training camp, although he never played for the full team. We have now been informed that he is not allowed to play for our club in any capacity because he is considered a “professional” and any paid or unpaid cricket would be deemed “employment” and in breach of Home Office conditions. It doesn’t seem right that we can refuse to allow a young man the chance to play sport for fun, while he tries to settle in to a new country. RB, Brentwood, EssexYour would-be member appears to have fallen foul of updated Home Office guidance announced last year.The rules prohibit overseas sports people, without a work permit, from playing professional sport, but, last year, the definition of “professional” was broadened to include anyone who previously earned a living from playing a sport or intends to do so.However, the rules designed to prevent illegal working draw a distinction between “volunteering”, which is allowed, and “voluntary work”, which isn’t. It sounds as though your would-be member would be volunteering, rather than providing unpaid professional services, since there is no reward in money or benefits in kind, and no mutual obligation on either side.The Home Office refused to comment, but the Refugee Council reckons there should be no bar on this inidual playing as a hobby.Your Home Office letter should include details on how to challenge the decision.

The first of these can often get overlooked in favour of the second, but production is an essential part of the genre’s appeal. A slick production has the power to drive the lyrical message home: from the 80s, when Audio Two dropped their Daddy-O-produced classic Top Billin’ to 2001, when Dr Dre laced Still D.R.E with his signature aesthetic to the twisted work of Hit-Boy for stars of this decade such as Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West.One thing remains clear: production skews heavily towards men. Recent darlings include Mike Will Made-It, Murda Beatz, London on da Track, DJ Mustard – the list goes on. But as hip-hop evolves, more and more women are entering the production game.The gender ratio isn’t yet equal, but far more women are getting production credits than when LA producer Georgia Anne Muldrow, 34, came on the scene in the early 00s. “At that time, there weren’t any\u0026nbspother female producers in my social circle. But there were awesome female MCs,” she says. “You had Rah Digga, Digable Planets’\u0026nbspLadybug Mecca, Missy Elliot.\u0026nbspBut I wasn’t hooked up\u0026nbspwith them – everyone was just kind of doing their own thing. The\u0026nbspidea was just to be dope and get\u0026nbspyour stuff\u0026nbspheard.”Now, with female producers proliferating, women are expecting rather more than just getting heard – they can end up working with some of the genre’s biggest stars. Some gaining clout include Ebony “WondaGurl” Oshunrinde, who at just 21 has already made tracks for Drake, Travis Scott, Jay-Z and Rihanna, and the Virginia-based producer Shakari “Trakgirl” Boles, who has been in the studio with Omarion, Luke James and Jhené Aiko. She says that being a woman is no longer an impediment to getting ahead in the rap game. “The issue that I’ve had is something that happens in general: being undervalued and underappreciated,” says Boles. “That’s the same in any industry. But I would say it was a disadvantage being a woman in the beginning. I\u0026nbspwas underestimated. I’ve learned\u0026nbspto build an armour when it\u0026nbspcomes to that.”“I’m not offered some opportunities, I think, just because I am a woman,” says Harlem’s Crystal Caines (above), a producer since 2014. “I can’t assume, but ... those opportunities are present, and yet they will give them to men over me.” But she sees the situation improving. “I\u0026nbspwas acknowledged as a producer first – now, I’m able to introduce myself as an artist, a producer and an engineer.” Caines, 26, is known for her haunting, slowed-down sound, which can be heard on tracks by artists such as A$AP Ferg, Smoke DZA and female rapper Bbymutha. “I just love making the artist\u0026nbspuncomfortable sonically – that’s when they get the best product from me.”But, Muldrow says, while sexism still exists, the industry has advanced to the point where you can no longer make the excuse that being female is holding you back. “You can’t use that no more, because\u0026nbspthere are more women producers,” she says. “Now, it’s like, ‘Well, join the club!’ What’s gonna make you unique is being authentic if you ain’t born to do it, quit and figure out what it is you’re born to do. When you’re in there, you’ve gotta jam like your life depends on it. Put in that work. That’s what it’s\u0026nbspabout.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad4a1f5abc4b419ae367d14c8d0043d50865ec66/0_78_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dd7c126b3723de43ebdefb085599d1eb 1240w","title":"manic street preachers resistance is futile review defeat and defiance","story":"At first glance, the title of Manic Street Preachers’ 13th album hits like one among the many ebullient slogans they’ve fired out over the years. All rock’n’roll is homosexual! Self-disgust is self-obsession! Resistance is futile! Yet their latest aphorism, an unlikely borrowing from hive-minded Star Trek villains the Borg, comes as loaded with melancholy as provocation. These songs, in which the rough-edged art-punk core of the Manics’ earliest days needles through mature, accomplished lushness, are heavy with a sense of the passing of all things and an uncertainty about their place in the world: “There will be no parades for the likes of us  The wars we fight are doomed to be lost,” frets the glitteringly sharp Sequels of Forgotten Wars.For every note of defeat, though, there’s a roar of defiance. People Give In also asserts that “people stay strong”, its music box-like guitar line ricocheting anxiously up and down before resolving into a sunburst-through-clouds riff’n’string chorus. International Blue’s tribute to Yves Klein, too, glows with bright energy and hope, while Dylan \u0026amp Caitlin, featuring the Anchoress, turns the darkness of the Thomases’ alcoholic romance into an effervescent homage to Don’t Go Breaking My Heart.Just as he did with 2014’s hard-to-follow triumph Futurology, Nicky Wire has hinted that Resistance Is Futile is “either a new era or the end”. “What is the future of the future?” riddles James Dean Bradfield on Hold Me Like a Heaven, in which “tattered manifestos litter the mind”. In place of certainties, comfort comes in the form of a ravishing chorus buoyed by warm woahh-ohhh-ohhhs. If this Sailing to Byzantium period didn’t suit them so well, you’d wish the Manics would stop being so hard on themselves. You can see why a band fond of grand statements, such as taking Noam Chomsky samples to the top of the pop charts, would question if just releasing more excellent Manic Street Preachers albums was enough. But their willingness to turn an ever-critical eye on themselves as well as on a changing world is what makes Resistance Is Futile so emotionally engaging, and more than enough to justify the future of their future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff605447fbb9b61f502c47b8273ae0a743d8d72/0_0_4000_2655/master/4000.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c16dd8c82d3806db8e85f2462f2cad52 720w","title":"scientists solve mystery of how giants causeway was formed","story":"Volcanologists use samples from Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland to recreate famous hexagonal columns in laboratoryAccording to legend, the Giant’s Causeway was built by the Irish giant, Finn MacCool, as a crossing to confront his Scottish rival. Scientists have an alternative explanation, and for the first time they have reproduced in the laboratory the process through which the causeway’s 40,000 near-perfect hexagonal columns were formed.Geometric columns are seen in a variety of volcanic rocks across the Earth and are known to form as the rock cools and contracts, resulting in a regular array of polygonal prisms or columns. But until now, geologists had been unsure of the threshold at which cooling magma suddenly fractures into a geometric pavement.To answer the question, Lavallée and colleagues recreated the process in the laboratory using basalt cores drilled from the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. The 20cm-long cylinders, gripped by a clamp at each end, were heated to more than 1,000C until they began to soften into lava. The samples were fixed at each end in a mechanical grip and cooled to test at what point they snapped.The basalt magma fractured at between 840-890C, the study found, suggesting that this is the temperature at which the Giant’s Causeway would have formed.“I have spent over a decade pondering how to address this question and construct the right experiment to find the answer to this question,” said Lavallée. “Now, with this study, we have found that the answer is hot, but after it solidified.”In the future, he hopes to extend the investigation by using a large pool of magma to reproduce the geometric fracturing as rock is cooled – although he said such an experiment would need to be performed under carefully controlled conditions.The Giant’s Causeway formed between 50 and 60 million years ago, when the region that now sits on the Antrim coastline was subject to intense volcanic activity. Molten basalt erupted through chalk beds and formed a lake of lava. As this cooled and contracted, cracks propagated across the plateau to form hexagonal stepping stones. Similar geological structures are seen elsewhere in the world, including Devils Postpile in the US, and the pattern occurs on many scales because faster cooling produces smaller columns.The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fb8605654042a1ebe82f9254ef041b3832a78d/0_258_3870_2322/master/3870.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=234c4b0fad951fe4df4084dda213cb65 1240w","title":"colin kaepernick seahawks workout postponed","story":"The Seattle Seahawks were all set to work out former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick earlier this week, but rescinded the invitation after he wouldn’t say whether he plans to continue kneeling in protest during the national anthem, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.The team wasn’t so much concerned with Kaepernick’s position as it was that he didn’t seem to have a firm plan for his future, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.“On Colin Kaepernick and #Seahawks: From a team perspective, they wanted to hear Kaepernick’s plan going forward, including but not limited to kneeling. There is also the lawsuit, for instance... From those close to Kaepernick, they maintain it was only, Will you keep kneeling?,” read one Rapoport tweet.“#Seahawks brass, John Schneider and Pete Carroll, want Colin Kaepernick to consider how he wants to proceed on everything (not just anthem) and get together at a later date when his plans are formed. Clearly, Seattle has accepted players speaking out for what they believe,” read another.Kaepernick has a pending lawsuit alleging collusion by the league office, owners and teams to keep him out of the NFL. He was deposed by the NFL’s lawyers in that lawsuit on Tuesday. Kaepernick began his pregame protest following excessive force cases involving police. He first sat during the anthem in the 2016 season and then knelt. Eventually he was joined by his San Francisco 49ers teammates, including safety Eric Reid, and players on other teams followed suit. Kaepernick, who hasn’t played since 1 January 2017, also has 2,300 career rushing yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground. He hasn’t had a workout with any NFL teams since becoming a free agent. Kaepernick, 30, met with Seattle during free-agency last offseason, but the team opted instead to sign Austin Davis to back up Russell Wilson. Davis, who was on a one-year deal, is now a free agent and the team also recently released Trevone Boykin, leaving them with zero options behind Wilson at the moment. Three NFL owners are on the deposition list for Kaepernick’s lawsuit: Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots and Bob McNair of the Houston Texans. McNair was infamously quoted in an ESPN report as suggesting the league should crack down on protests because “we can’t have the inmates running the prison”.Head coaches John Harbaugh of the Ravens and the team’s general manager, Ozzie Newsome, are also on the request list from Kaepernick’s attorneys. The same goes for the Seahawks’ braintrust of coach Pete Carroll and GM John Schneider and NFL executives Troy Vincent and Arthur McAfee.

With three rounds left both the Sharks and Newcastle are strong contenders for Europe’s Champions Cup qualification with a top-four spot hinging on the outcome of Friday ’s shoot-out at Kingston Park.The two clubs are separated by only one point in fifth and sixth positions, with the winners set to jump into third. Wasps and Leicester will not be easily denied play-off places but fifth-placed Newcastle, with two of their last three games at home plus a trip to face the Tigers, can still shape their own destiny.Sale will have to dig even deeper, with a long hike to Exeter and a final home fixture against Leicester rounding off a tricky run-in, but their confidence has been given a timely lift by last week’s dramatic win over Wasps. Trailing 17-0 in the first half they came back to win 28-27 courtesy of Marland Yarde’s last-second try.According to their captain, Jono Ross, the trick now is to reproduce their dominant home form on the road. This season they have won away against only the bottom three teams in the league and will need to find an extra gear to outwit the Falcons and the Chiefs. “We think we’re a good side but we haven’t been as good as we’ve wanted to away from home,” Ross said. “We need to replicate the performances we’ve put in at the AJ Bell. Hopefully that will be enough.”A big finish would also improve Ross’s chances of a place on England’s tour to his native South Africa. The Johannesburg-born back-row forward is qualified for England via a grandmother from Essex and Sale’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, said Eddie Jones and England’s forwards coach, Steve Borthwick, have been making inquiries.Exeter (already qualified for play-offs) L Irish (a), Sale (h), Harlequins (a)Ross, who had stints as a young player with Harlequins, Saracens and the Bulls in South Africa, spent three years playing alongside Sergio Parisse for Stade Français before joining Sale last summer and has become an influential figure for the Sharks, assuming the captaincy after an injury to Will Addison. “For me it’s about performing well for Sale week-in week-out. I don’t want to think about things that are out of my control. I’ve had no conversations with Eddie but every player has international aspirations.”The 27-year-old is clearly resilient, having featured in every league game this season, and has been pleasantly surprised by life in the Premiership compared with the slower-paced Top 14. “The speed of the game and the conditioning are quite different to what I experienced in France. It’s more similar to back home in South Africa. There are also a fantastic group of people here. We care about each other and I think that shows.”For the Newcastle game Paolo Odogwu and Luke James start at left wing and inside-centre respectively, with the tighthead prop WillGriff John returning to the front row and Byron McGuigan named at full-back. The 18-year-old Cameron Redpath, the English-qualified son of the former Scotland international Bryan, is poised to make his Premiership debut off the bench.Newcastle’s lineup features Gary Graham, who is back after injuring his neck at England training in early February, with Joel Hodgson, the league’s most accurate goalkicker this season, chosen ahead of Toby Flood at fly-half. “For us it’s a must-win game in terms of keeping our top-four hopes alive,” said Dean Richards, the Falcons’ director of rugby. “If we don’t win we can almost kiss the semi-finals goodbye.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7405c5fc9466c0be80616b4a13277117ee5fede2/0_86_4445_2668/master/4445.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8283cbb09cfd5158ef310e199f5b3c94 2600w","title":"grand national 2018 a horse by horse betting guide","story":"We go through the 40 runners for the 2018 edition of the world’s most famous horse raceLong had a big reputation but one win from 13 runs over fences is disappointing. Worth remembering, in light of Native River’s Gold Cup win, that Minella Rocco beat that one at the previous two Festivals, including when he won the four-miler as a six-year-old. A big, strong stayer, he can have a lumbering look over his fences and might not be best suited by having to navigate the Canal Turn among rivals. Like many others from his stable, he has not been at his best this winter. Carries more weight than any National winner since 1974. Looked the likely winner when going clear after the third-last a year ago but was on fumes by the final fence and faded into fourth. More conservative tactics might help but he’s 9lb higher and carries 12lb more in absolute terms. Romped to glory in the Becher, showing how well he goes round here, but the extra weight he got for that did not help at Haydock in February, where he couldn’t go with the easy winner and finished tired. Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way.Couldn’t finish quite as strongly as a classy rival when second in the 2016 National. Shot up the ratings, has not won since and is still 10lb higher than that day. Faded into a well-beaten 16th last year and something similar seems likely. Admirably consistent but in need of luck.Wasn’t far off the best when with Willie Mullins, for whom he won two Grade Ones as a novice. May well have won the 2016 Irish Gold Cup, but for unseating at the last. Missed a year and four runs since his comeback seem to show him in decline. Still high in the weights, just 5lb below his peak, and would need something like his best to get involved here. Stamina must also be taken on trust, as he’s never raced beyond three miles and a furlong.Instantly improved by last summer’s move to Willie Mullins, since when his only failure has been a fall in the Gold Cup. Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention.Not far short of the best as a staying hurdler and useful over fences but is rated to the hilt of his ability. Ran a fair race to be eighth in last year’s Irish National, when he was hampered by a faller, and beaten only by Total Recall in the Munster National, trying to give him lumps of weight. Not usually a strong finisher and has broken blood vessels at times.Cheltenham specialist who has run many fine races there but not usually to the same level elsewhere. Pulled up at the fourth-last a year ago and only 2lb lower in the weights this time but trainer says he had an interrupted preparation then. A sound jumper and solid stayer with no secrets from the handicapper and likely to be outpaced by something if still in contention after the last.Would have an extra 4lb to carry if the weights had not been set in February, since when he ran a fine second at the Cheltenham Festival, finishing strongly to be beaten by a neck. Promising teenage jockey who rode that day will be aboard again. Pulled up four fences from home last year but was only seven and entitled to do better now. Hasn’t won since but several efforts have suggested he is ready for this marathon trip. Slight concern that his Cheltenham form is so much better than elsewhere.A front-runner when things go well, he never got involved last year and finished 17th. In common with most of his stablemates, has been well below his best this year but the yard is now getting winners. Wins over fences have come in small fields, which does not augur well here. It’s more than five years since he won at a track where the bends go to the left.Irish Gold Cup winner of 2015 and 2016, this veteran has dropped a stone from his peak rating in the past year and is now on a weight that would make him dangerous if he returned to something like his best. Has shown little in four runs this season but all came before New Year, when he has not traditionally been at his best. Interesting.Winner of the last two Scottish Grand Nationals, proving that big-field marathon handicaps on flat, left-handed tracks in the spring are his thing. That makes him of obvious interest, though he’s no certainty to get round. He fell at the first a year ago, one of three times in his last nine starts he’s managed to get rid of his jockey. A big run is possible if he avoids such disasters.Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority.Ran on in eye-catching style to be eighth last year, having seemingly been given too much to do. Put up another fine effort when third in the Ladbrokes Trophy in December and warmed up for this by scoring at Ascot in February. Has taken years to build on his early promise but finally doing so and has it in him to land a major prize. Still on a fair weight and 4lb well in, as his Ascot win came after the weights were set.Hoping it can be third time lucky but the limitations of his stamina seemed to be exposed by the last two Nationals. Has had a poor season, failing to finish within 12 lengths of a winner, but is slightly higher in the ratings than for his previous two attempts, which hardly seems fair. Comes from a stable having a poor run.Muddy marathons are the thing for this winner of last year’s Midlands National. On drier ground or against classy opposition, he generally gets left behind. Having won at Haydock in November, he went up 10lb and has struggled in two subsequent runs, suggesting he lacks the necessary quality unless it rains plenty. A dogged galloper, he goes well at Newbury and should therefore be suited by this circuit. Looked as though he was reaching the limits of his stamina when headed close home in the Great Yorkshire Chase, over a mile shorter than this. Up against it, on a rating 12lb higher than when he last won.Third in the Scottish National two years ago, though his jumping was scrappy at times and his stamina gave out about a furlong from the line. Has had a wind operation. Because of injuries, his decent third in a much shorter race last month was his first run over fences for 16 months, which is not ideal preparation. Nicely weighted on the pick of his form, including a defeat of Blaklion at Cheltenham two years ago. Jumped the last with the leaders last year but had nothing left and tired into fifth, having taken a shoulder-barge from the runner-up at the second-last. Fell at the first in 2015 but usually does well over these fences, having won here in December. Has held his form so well that he is now rated higher than ever, 4lb higher than for last year’s race. Another respectable showing is likely.Career best in January when running away with the Peter Marsh, pulling 13 lengths clear of Captain Redbeard. Was fired up the ratings to a mark 9lb higher than he’s ever been and may struggle to compete until he drops back down. He was carrying less weight that day than four other finishers of moderate talent, whereas here he will mix with Festival winners on a similar weight. Stopped quickly and was found to have bled from the nose when pulled up at Haydock in February.Given every chance last year by a masterful Ruby Walsh ride, creeping smoothly into contention on the second circuit before getting tired from the third-last and finishing ninth. Jumped soundly but stumbled and nearly unseated on landing over second Valentine’s, which can’t have helped. Only 1lb lower, despite modest efforts on both starts this season, and won’t have Walsh’s help. This plodder must be one of the few horses to spend three years in Gordon Elliott’s yard without winning. Often runs well, however, and has twice been placed in the Thyestes and also in Leopardstown’s Paddy Power Chase. Was a distant sixth in this race two years ago after notable mistakes. Went well last year until a rival jumped across him at Becher’s, causing his rider to fall off. Generally a sound jumper but will surely find something too quick for him on the run-in, even if his stamina holds up.Fine record at Aintree in April stretches back to 2011, when he won a Grade One novice hurdle. Won a handicap chase the next year and has since been second and third in the National, from four attempts. Soft ground is no use, as he showed when pulled up in 2016. Gets to run off the same rating as when third last year but we can’t be sure he retains his ability aged 12. He’s had just two runs this season and predictably failed to cope with soggy ground both times. Stable has been quiet for a month or two.Record of steady progress over the years and showed his best form with three consecutive wins last spring and summer, battling to win the City of Perth Gold Cup on the line. Only 4lb higher for that, though this represents an enormous step up in quality. Best form has been on a dry surface and he won’t get that. Likely to show up well for a long way before fading.Stormed clear in the Welsh Grand National and would have done the same the previous season if he hadn’t bumped into a future Gold Cup winner in Native River. Is also a winner of the Munster National and two Cork Nationals, giving him an excellent record in big-field marathons. Gone up another 6lb to match the highest rating he’s ever had and Chepstow form does not always translate well to Aintree. He’s a hold-up horse who will therefore need luck, which he didn’t get last year, when he unseated his jockey while dodging a faller. Would be the oldest winner for 95 years but clearly is not in decline. Very dangerous if able to get into contention by the third-last.Entered the reckoning with an authoritative success in the North Yorkshire Grand National, when he made all the running. Went up a stone in the weights, which is a lot for beating five finishers who have done little for the form. That might have been his big day, in a race the trainer was winning for the third year in a row, at a course where this horse is unbeaten. But he copes well with a stamina test and could have more to offer.Has a good record round Aintree’s Mildmay course, which may not translate to the much bigger National course and fences. Disappointing when eighth there in November and had a wind operation the next month. Unraced since mid-December, an unorthodox National preparation. Likes a dry-ish surface, so could do without much rain. Fairly weighted and could get involved if everything falls right but more likely to be seeking softer targets.Tough, staying mare who is still young enough to have her best days ahead of her, being younger than any National winner since 1940. Never got into it when sixth in the 2016 Irish National and could only find the one pace when fifth in the Welsh National that year. Last seen running a fair third in Punchestown’s National Trial, giving weight to the first two, who made that form look good in the Irish National. She’s in big trouble if a turn of foot is required but, granted soft ground, she could get a lot of these in trouble by grinding along relentlessly in front.Went into a lot of notebooks as a National type when bolting up by 12 lengths in a race on the Mildmay course here two years ago, but then had to miss last year’s National after a badly timed injury. Hard to say how much ability he retains, as he’s been raced so sparingly and often over hurdles but it’s a concern that he is now older than any National winner since 1923. Leap of faith required.Stamina is the most obvious weak spot for this talented but frustrating type who appears not to be the most robust. Beaten over 100 lengths into 13th two years ago, eased down on the run-in on soft ground. Has only had two runs since, when a fine second in last year’s Kim Muir and when well beaten in the same race this year. Ground made the difference it was good when he was second, very testing when he flopped. Hard to believe he’s a National winner in waiting. Famously frustrating beast who has finished fast but too late on many a day, often after killing his chance with a mistake. Has been held back by metal pins in a back leg but the trainer says he’s moving better than ever and won a decent pot at Sandown in January. Offsetting that he ran so poorly when 12th in the 2016 National on soft ground, which should have suited, and after a much stronger season than this one.One of the least experienced in the field after just four runs over fences, of which his only win came in a 2016 beginners’ chase. Background and pedigree suggest his stamina might not stretch to a race like this and he was pulled up on his only attempt in a long-distance handicap chase. Doesn’t seem to like big fields. Rating looks a bit high. Hard to fancy.Ruined his chance last year by boiling over before the start. Did pretty well, then, to work his way into contention by the second-last but was a tired seventh in the end. Fell on his only outing since, when heavy ground did not suit. If the weather dries up and he behaves himself, it’s not beyond him to get involved off a rating that has dropped a stone and a half from his peak. He was a dual Festival winner but four years is a long time to make your supporters wait for another victory.Game and consistent, he’s already had an excellent season, winning the Tommy Whittle in December and chasing home The Dutchman in the Peter Marsh back at Haydock. Warmed up with a first hurdles success for two years. Still on a beatable rating in the right contest but this might not be it. There’s a lot more strength in depth than he’s used to meeting and all his wins have come in single-figure fields. Not the most efficient jumper, mixing flamboyant leaps with the odd mistake. He didn’t have much left at the end of his last two races.Thoroughly experienced plodder after 38 starts over fences. By no means a prolific winner in recent seasons, though he managed to nick a weak race at Sandown in November. Got round in his own time to be 10th last year, beaten by 42 lengths. Could do better if the ground is soft. Blinkers may have helped when he was third at Ascot last month and could do so again. A distant third in the Welsh National last season and has since dropped 9lb, while his stable has finally hit form after a bleak winter, so a case can be made for him plugging on into fifth, maybe.Veteran of 46 races over fences showed his wellbeing by winning round Cheltenham’s cross-country course in December. Has twice been second in the Irish National and was beaten just a short-head in 2016 under Ruby Walsh. Now 6lb higher than when second at Fairyhouse last year. Jumping has never been flawless but a clear round could easily put him in the leading bunch on the run from the third-last. Doubtful he can be fastest from there. Could do with the ground drying up.Gave a mulish display when dropping himself out in the Welsh National and was then remarkably revived by the fitting of blinkers when an easy winner of Warwick’s Classic Chase. A change of jockey may also have helped. Believing he would miss the cut for this, connections raced him in two more marathons on heavy going in the past two months, including a fair second in the Midlands National. Will have to be remarkably robust to show his best form here at the end of such a taxing season.Close second in the Badger Ales on his first run of the season but went up a few pounds and has not really shone in stronger races since. Travelled strongly in the Welsh National and Kim Muir before the limitations of his stamina appeared to be shown up in both. Was running a fair race just behind the leaders when his saddle slipped at the second Canal Turn two years ago, causing him to be pulled up. Now 7lb lower and capable of going well again, though his form this season has been patchy. Was giving lumps of weight to the first three when fourth at Chepstow in October and plugged on gamely to be fourth in the Kim Muir last month. Stamina must be in question, given he got tired and faded in the Hennessy for the last two years.Career peaked with an extremely game effort to be third in an attritional Cheltenham Gold Cup three years ago, when quality rivals like Many Clouds, Silviniaco Conti and Carlingford Lough were a long way behind. Ran to a high level for another season after that and was second in the 2016 Irish Gold Cup but has been two stones below his best in the last year. Enthusiasm seems to be on the wane, despite various bits of headgear being tried. On a dangerously low rating if he ever does bounce back to something like his best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2324993cb8ab8e433e136069ba262f0e8c94031/0_0_3600_2400/master/3600.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dd172d99b68aa6eb60a3e310b2887b7d 2020w","title":"commonwealth games day nine hockey rugby sevens and more live","story":"The rest of today’s track and field action begins in about an hour and here’s what’s on the menu ... Gold Coast and Birmingham could hardly be more different as cities go but Commonwealth Games organisers on both sides believe there are plenty of lessons that will translate ahead of the 2022 Games in Britain’s second city.As the 2018 Games go into their final weekend in the surfers paradise which is Australia’s Gold Coast, attention is beginning to turn to the next edition in the industrial and commercial surrounds of Birmingham, which saw off competition from Liverpool to host the 2022 edition after Durban, South Africa, was stripped of the Games.Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate has told his Birmingham counterparts the Games present an opportunity to change perceptions - whether that be Gold Coast’s transition from holiday destination to business centre or updating people’s ideas about Birmingham.“It was an opportunity that knocked on the door and we absolutely utilised the spirit of the Commonwealth brand to enhance our city’s reputation,” Tate told PA Sport.“We have now stepped up from being a regional city to a world city. Trades and businesses can see we’ve hosted the Commonwealth Games and we’re well equipped with infrastructure, you can come here and do business. We’ve hosted the third biggest mutli-sport event in the world so you don’t need to ask our credentials.”It is a model Birmingham can follow, according to Steve Hollingworth, head of sport and events for Birmingham City Council. “The perception of Birmingham is a very industrial area, a grey miserable city, but that’s not the case,” he said. “It’s a very modern dynamic city of the world. But people need to see that so we need to get the city on the global stage. A 1.5billion television audience is really important.” Birmingham landed the Games after Durban was stripped of hosting rights due to financial constraints. It’s after 6pm on the Gold Coast, but if you’re just joining us for the first time in the UK this morning, here’s a summary of what happened overnight. Those rugby sevens results are coming in thick and fast. Australia have seen off Wales with a minimum of fuss in their Pool B match at the Robinha Stadium, scoring six tries in the process. England have got off to a winning start in the women’s rgby sevens, seeing off Fiji in a reasonably tight affair. Emily Scarratt, Deborah Fleming and Lydia Thompson got the tries for England, with Timaima Ravisa getting a consolation for Fiji. Anyone like me who’s ever played on a team that’s taken a pasting in a game of rugby sevens will know just how big that pitch can be when you’re chasing shadows and sympathise with the women of Kenya who’ve had to try to go toe to toe with their New Zealand counterparts. They’ve been absolutely battered in their Pool A match by a team that was far too good for them. Portia Woodman was the standout player for New Zealand, while Niall Williams grabbed herself a splendidly opportunistic try, chasing up to pounce as one of the Kenyans tried to shepherd the ball out over the dead-ball line. As the sister of All Black Sonny Bill Williams, Niall comes from a family with a fair amount of rugby pedigree. I wonder if she’s as handy as her brother in the boxing ring too?Canada are pulling off quite the demolition job on South Africa in the women’s rugby sevens as I strap myself into the hot-seat. WIth just seconds left in the second half of their Pool A match at the Robina Stadium, the Canadians lead 29-0. Indeed, that’s a result: Canada 29-0 South Africa, with 24 of the winning points coming in the first half. The Canadians scored five tries, with Charity Williams, Sara Kaljuvee, Hannah Darling, Caroline Crossley and Brittany Benn all crossing the line. Ghislaine Landry scored two conversions. And as New Zealand take to the field against Kenya, I shall take my own humble bows. The one, the only, Barry Glendenning, stands poised and ready to shoulder arms here on the liveblog for Team Guardian.Thanks for your company and don’t look away, as the day’s action is only just beginning on the Gold Coast!Rugby sevens – Canada draw first bloodAnd Canada have really thrown down the gauntlet to the rest of the women’s field here – as they’ve raced to a 24-0 first half lead against South Africa.Facing one of the favourites, Renfred Dazel’s side could ill-afford charity, Charity Williams that is, who was one of four try scorers in the opening stanza.And Canada have opened how they started in the second half with some fine running rugby to land a fifth. They’ve been so consistent on the women’s sevens series where they’ve been reliably the third best team in the world behind Australia and New Zealand. Can they go one better here at Robina Stadium?South Africa with a rare foray forward but they can’t make the passes stick out wide and Canada keep their line intact. 3 minutes to play here, with Sara Kaluvee getting through a power of work.Canada grab a scrum against the feed – they’re really dominating at all aspects of the game. Megan Lukan busts through the guts, but is hauled down by some desperate South African defence. But it’s full-time: 29-0 as Canada win the inaugural match of rugby sevens at the Commonwealth Games!It’s been one of many laudable aspects to these Games with Gold Coast organisers working very hard to create an inclusive space inside the Athlete’s village and around the venues for LGBTI competitors.Guardian’s own Martha Kelner caught up with England’s recent gold medallist, Tom Daley, speaking as an openly gay man in a context where participants from 37 competing nations still face anti-homosexual legislation.It feels like one of the more anticipated events of these Games and we’re not too far away from a first kick in anger at the women’s rugby sevens, which makes its Commonwealth Games debut in around.. two minutes time!First up is Canada v South Africa – no slouches here the North Americans, they did, as you’ll recall finish with the bronze at Rio 2016.And 47 seconds in, we have our first points of the Game – an error by the South Africans enables Canada to overload their right flank, and they send their winger, Caroline Crossley over. No conversion, 5-0 the score.A wrap of the day’s boxing bouts, where there have been plenty of bronze medals awarded, with our gold medal stoushes still to come.England’s Lisa Whiteside and Northern Ireland’s Carly McNaul have advanced in the women’s 51kg ision, with England’s Paige Murney and Australia’s Anja Stridsman set to square off in the 60kg final.Good news also for England’s Galal Yafai and India’s Amit (so good they named him once) in the \u0026lt50kg ision, with compatriot Gaurav Solanki and Northern Ireland’s Brendan Irvine set to face in the 52kg final.It’s India again advancing in the 60kg class, where Manish Kausik will face Australia’s Harry Garside, while Jonas Jonas (so good they named him twice) of Namibia has advanced to face Canada’s Thomas Blumenfeld in the 64kg final.Finally, it’s an all-antipodean slugfest in the 91kg bout as New Zealand’s David Nyika is set to face Australia’s Jason Whateley.So a fair mix of nations in the hunt for boxing gold, with the weight of a nation on the shoulders of Jonas Jonas as he chases just Namibia’s fourth ever Games gold.A recap on where we’re at in the women’s heptathlon, where there’s been a lot of interest not just in the form of favourite Katarina Johnson-Thompson, but also the two local hopes Alysha Burnett who has been battling a hamstring injury picked up in the 200m, and youngster Celeste Mucci.Don’t forget England lost Katie Stainton in disastrous circumstances less than five seconds into the entire event as she fell heavily in the 110m hurdles, but with two events conducted today KJT appears to have all but secured the gold.She blew away her competitors with a 6.50m mark in the long jump, an effort that wouldn’t have looked out of place in the stand-alone women’s final, before only conceding 130 points in her less fancied event of javelin.Nina Schultz of Canada finished second in the long jump and fifth in the javelin, with Mucci third and sixth to maintain their positions of second and third on the provisional podium. Burnett with the longest throw in the javelin to keep pace at fifth overall, but she may face difficulty with her hamstring once more in the 800m.If successful in tonight’s last event it will be some statement of intent from KJT who revealed she was emotionally ‘burnt out’ after winning gold at the world indoor games last month.In their own wordsCyprus gymnast Diamanto Evripidou says she arrived at the Gold Coast hoping to win a medal. Job done, eh?“I came here to win one medal only, and I have six,” the 18-year-old said. “I will work a lot to reach my goals, and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games is one of them.” And also this, from England’s Tom Daley after his win alongside Daniel Goodfellow in the men’s 10m synchronised ing, after overcoming a hip injury that forced him to withdraw from the inidual event. “I know I’ve won medals in the past but it’s been a smoother journey to get to those competitions whereas this has been a really rough and rocky ride,” he told the BBC. And while we catch our collective breath from that high drama (TM), let’s sneak around the grounds:It’s been a display of shuttlecock by the Adcock’s as England’s duo Chris and Gabrielle have beaten the Australian pair in the badminton mixed doubles quarterfinals.We’ve got semifinals underway in the men’s 64kg boxing where Canada’s Thomas Blumenfeld appears to be shading Ghana’s Jessie Lartey.In the women’s hockey 5th place match it’s Canada also enjoying a lead over African opposition in the form of South Africa – they lead 2-0 with a quarter to play, thanks to Shanlee Johnson and Madeleine Secco’s first stanza goals. A reminder the men’s semifinals will take place later tonight (local) with Australia facing England, and India locking horns with New Zealand.On the greens of Broadbeach, England have beaten Wales for the bronze medal in the men’s lawn bowl fours, while there’s another antipodean battle going down in the men’s squash doubles quarterfinals with Australia and New Zealand deep in the third set.And for seemingly the first time I’ve been in this chair, I can happily report, that is actually everything that’s happening right now! So much so that local broadcaster Channel 7 has taken us to an extended press conference announcing their network’s coup in pinching free-to-air cricket from rivals Channel 9. Saucer of milk, anyone?Wowee. We’ve had a very tight measure from the umpire, with both teams appearing confident of a one-ball lead. From my uninformed eye I thought that was the Scots’ point, but a roar goes up, it’s awarded to the host nation and they take a 13-11 lead into the last end. As they say, it’s a game of millimetres!Great battles within battles here, don’t forget it was two of the Scottish four here, Ronald Duncan and Derek Oliver, who beat three of the Australians here for gold in the men’s triples. The other two Scots picked up silver in the men’s pairs so some real bowls pedigree here.Huge roar from the engrossed home crowd here as Australia’s lead Barrie Lester drops his first ball right on the jack. But with the stakes incredibly high Scotland’s Oliver, bowling second, has fired a two-point turnaround can they lock it up?! There are five balls left to fire, with Scotland three to throw. Can they add a third and pull of a remarkable turnaround to snatch gold?!Marshall drops one more in it’s a potential three-pointer – but have they left themselves open to a drive? Sherriff fires, but he’s only cleaned out a screening Australian bowl!Marshall drops another in – learned bowls experts would rightly point out that he’s only doubled the potential target for a cleanout has he thrown it away? But would you believe it – Sherriff’s missed with a second drive, and Scotland land a four pointer! With the final end, they’ve turned this all around to win 15-13! Remarkable action. And what a Games this is turning into for the Scottish bowls team!Meanwhile, we’ve got a sneaky little ding-dong battle brewing over at Broadbeach Bowls Club where it’s Australia and Scotland trading blows in the men’s fours gold medal match.We join the coverage 12 ends in where it’s the host nation leading 12-10, with four balls (two each) to come. Having jumped to a 8-2 lead after four ends the Australian team of Barrie Lester, Brett Wilkie, Nathan Rice and Aron Sherriff have seen some tenacious bowling from the Scots and as we speak, they’ve reversed a potential two-pointer here for Australia into one of their own. That’s four of the last five ends to Scotland what a finish we have in store here!In addition to the one-woman nation Diamanto Evripidou here’s a rundown of what other medals have already been claimed this morning:It’s an Indian one-two in the women’s 50m rifle 3 positions, as Tejaswini Sawant continues her fine form, with compatriot Anjum Moudgil grabbing the silver ahead of Scotland’s Seonaid McIntosh.Gold for India also in the men’s 25m rapid fire pistol where the remarkable fifteen-year-old Anish (so good they named him once) has held off local favourite Sergei Evglevski with a games record performance. He was flawless after two attempts, instantly doubling the scores of four of his five rivals. What a future lies ahead, at such a tender age!It’s been a terrific day for Malaysia as well, with Evripidou unable to take ALL the medals in the rhythmic gymnastics, the Malay duo of Sie Yan Koi and Kwan Dict Weng have helped themselves to gold, two silvers and two bronzes. Their women’s pair lawn bowls team have also grabbed gold over at Broadbeach, relegating South Africa and Scotland to the minors.Finally, it’s been a powerful display from England in the men’s synchronised 10m platform ing with Thomas Daley and Daniel Goodfellow just shading compatriots Matthew Dixon and Noah Williams in a synchro one-two. Australia with the bronze but they really have dominated the ing boards have England. Chapeau!And let’s take a look at the latest medal tally where the big movers appear to be Cyprus, off the back of a phenomenal day’s work from their unbelievable rhythmic gymnast Diamanto Evripidou.With four gold, one silver and a bronze – claiming a medal in every event she entered – the pocket rocket would be sitting 13th in the Commonwealth if she had entered as an stand-alone nation.She joins England’s gymnast Nile Wilson (four gold and two silver) and Australian swimmer Mitch Larkin (five gold) in rarified company, with four of those medals coming in the last 24 hours.As an aside – when you split the medals of the leading nations by gender some very curious things leap out. Australia’s men and women have thirty each (with three coming from mixed-gender teams), England fifteen and thirteen respectively, and India’s sexes both pulling their weight with six and eight gold each.Send your entries to “What has happened to Canadian men” care of the nearest local post office etc etc. Until I hear otherwise I will hold full-time heartthrob and part-time politician Justin Trudeau personally responsible he’s apparently emasculated an entire nation.Kia ora koutou – welcome to day nine of the Commonwealth Games!If you missed yesterday’s action there was another strong showing for the host nation, spearheaded by the amazing Ken Hanson, a first-time medallist at the age of 68. There was the highest of high drama in the men’s 200m final, and a heart-warmingbreaking tale as British Virgin Islands claimed it’s first ever gold.There’s a nice sneak peak at Australia’s women’s rugby sevens team, eager to defend their Rio gold and a fine write-up of the irrepressible Jack Laugher in the ing.As always, feel free to shoot any quips, tangential stories or corrections to join the coverage – via the email or twitter account outlined above. But first, a look at what’s in store today.Here’s what’s still to come on day nine. Remember, all times are local – the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00.It’s hotting up in many of the team events, and we start with Canada and South Africa battling for fifth in the women’s hockey.At 3pm local there are medals on offer in the women’s shooting trap final, before men’s hockey takes centre stage as Scotland and Malaysia lock horns, also for fifth.Rugby sevens makes its long-awaited start from 4.30pm with eight matches in the women’s preliminaries, before the medals continue in table tennis and wrestling, as well as lawn bowls where the men’s singles bronze and gold medal matches take centre lawn from 5.30pm.All of that in the ‘lull’ part of the day before athletics, ing, hockey and basketball renew again in anger. It’s Commonwealth Games, it’s happening live, and it’s coming at you like two South African sprinters when everyone told you Yohan Blake would win."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

But 2018 looks set to be an equally memorable, and much less harrowing, time, as more than 400 projects mark its year as European Capital of Culture.Malta has managed to shed its pensioners’ package holiday image, reinventing itself with boutique hotels and festivals. And Valletta itself, a city barely touched for centuries – except by Luftwaffe bombers – has changed, too. A decade ago, its 40,000 office workers would depart the city every evening, leaving its ancients streets with barely a bar or restaurant to lighten the gloom. Today, visitors stay here, in old townhouses repurposed as boutique hotels such as Palazzo Consiglia (doubles from €140), rather than heading to touristy Sliema or St Julian’s. And while teens still party in Paceville, on the coast further north, Valletta’s Strait Street has evolved into a more sophisticated nightlife hub.Over the coming months Strait Street will see bars, restaurants and music venues collaborating on live shows, street theatre, performance poetry and jamming sessions – part of an ambitious vision for Valletta, that by the end of 2018 should garner it a reputation as one of the Mediterranean’s most exciting and innovative arts cities. Here are some of the year’s standouts.If anything symbolises new-look Valletta, it’s the remodelled City Gate, which is the focus of much of the celebrations, particularly the opening ceremony. Malta’s biggest architectural undertaking for centuries, it has been masterminded by Italy’s Renzo Piano. His elegant Parliament building, just inside the gate, has been acclaimed for its innovative use of Malta’s traditional building material, globigerina limestone from the island of Gozo. Now, shallow flights of steps lead up either side of new “gate” – actually just a gap in the 16th-century walls, through which Valletta welcomes the world – to garden areas with great views of the fortifications and a newly landscaped moat with outdoor performance space. (Also opened in January – after many delays – was Valletta’s 1860 covered market, a few minutes’ walk into the city. It was brought back to its former wrought iron glory in a €14m project, and now has stalls, bars, restaurants and cultural spaces.)The flagship opening of 2018 is the new art gallery: Muża stands for Mużew Nazzjonali tal-Arti but muza is also Maltese for muse or inspiration. Scheduled to open in May in the 15th-century Auberge d’Italie, once home to the Italian Knights of St John, it will house the art collection of the former national gallery (closed in 2016) plus new acquisitions and commissions. There are rumours of world-class pieces being loaned temporarily from Florence or Rome. Before then, the Spazju Kreattiv cultural centre in a former fort built into the city walls, has European Eyes on Japan (until 29 April) by Maltese photographer Alexandra Pace and a photographer from Leeuwarden, this year’s co-capital of culture, both of whom were invited to live and work in Japan. Works by 20th-century giants Picasso and Mirò are on show at the Grand Master’s Palace until 30 June.• muza.heritagemalta.orgFrom Maltese artists looking out to international artists looking in: Altofest (which opens on Friday in Strait Street, then in 12 venues across Malta over the ensuing four weekends) is an intriguing experiment in contemporary live art. Twenty Maltese citizens will host international artists in their homes as they develop works on the theme of “Legendary People”. The homes will then become venues for the performances. Theatre lovers will also enjoy a trip to the open-air theatre in Ta’ Qali, Malta’s only national park, for Cantina (11-13 May), which uses Bertolt Brecht’s play Saint Joan of the Stockyards, set in a 1930s meatpacking plant, to take a fresh look at the theme of food and how it is valued.The music season warms up in May, along with the weather. Also in the national park, the eco-conscious Earth Garden Festival (31 May-3 June, one-day pass €15, camping €40pp) promises to be a feast of colour and sound with more than 35 acts. The lineup includes Lakota, the Turbans and Gentlemen’s DUB Club. July sees Malta Calls (tickets not on sale yet) an outdoor dance event led by Swedish DJ Per QX, in Pembroke, north of Valletta. Those visiting later in the year should look out for Kentaro!! (dates tbc), in which the Japanese DJ and choreographer will combine dance group Tokyo Electrock Stairs with local Maltese hip-hop artists.More mainstream, but certain to be spectacular, is this free event in the Grand Harbour on 7 June, with boat races and water-borne carnival floats. Hundreds of swimmers compete in a race across the water from Fort St Angelo, and in another event, teams construct boats from recycled materials and use them to cross the harbour without motor or traditional oars.In November, Austrian artist Willi Dorner is bringing his Bodies in Urban Spaces project to Valletta (after success in Copenhagen, Porto and 100 other cities). He calls it “a temporary intervention in ersified architectonical environments” but in normal language this means squeezing human bodies into the nooks and crannies of public spaces and seeing how people react. In the past the police have been called by people thinking they were witnessing vandalism or burglary. It will be interesting to see how Malta’s quite traditional police force (founded in 1814 under a British governor) will react.• Details of all events at valletta2018.org.

Now, with Elon Musk talking about getting his Mars colony up and running by 2040, this Netflix reboot doesn’t require such a giant leap of the imagination.I’m (just) too young for Lost in Space 1.0, but I found the first episode. Wow, it looks like the TV equivalent of cave painting. It’s atmospheric, with great John Williams music, but the robot looks like it was made from cardboard boxes and bits of plumbing equipment. The medium has travelled light years in half a century.There is nothing cardboard about the new one – a serious Netflix budget sees to that. The Robinsons, no longer the perfect nuclear 1960s family, have gained some 21st-century attitude and dysfunction. The parents aren’t really together the kids have modern anxieties and mardiness. On the way to establish a new colony, they crash on a planet that looks like Canada but with even more extreme geography, weather and fauna. The opener is packed with nail-biting action and literal cliffhangers. Matriarch Maureen (Molly Parker) has broken her leg, Judy is trapped under the ice, time is running out, Will falls down a crevasse into a scary forest where he meets his robot (less plumbing, more CGI, same utterance: “Danger, Will Robinson”).The scene-setting continues over the next few episodes, with flashbacks to fill in the holes in space and time, and the introduction of other survivors, including wicked stowaway Dr Smith (Parker Posey – Dr Smith is now a woman). After that, it can settle into an orbit of family adventures.It looks great. I love the new Chariot. And it’s not unfun. But nor does it boldly go where no sci-fi show has gone before. Some of the characterisation is crude. Doc Smith, for example, is a two-dimensional comedy baddie rather than a proper villain to have nightmares about. The parents’ marital issues are touched on rather than explored. The kids are annoying, although, well, they’re kids, they’re allowed to be. But it’s all a bit shallow. I don’t feel myself getting lost in it.And if you put it next to a certain other family sci-fi programme that also began in the 60s and was reborn in the 21st century, and which also has a doctor – the Doctor – who recently regenerated as a woman, it lacks wit and warmth and wizardry.A missed opportunity then. But perhaps it’s also reassuring – not that there’s life out there, but that, when it comes to television drama, money isn’t everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4022fbfd327468c50ede0bab4816558c398f6df/108_0_2185_1311/master/2185.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3695e9c0abcc4011fc612bc516826911 1240w","title":"swastika trail canada ontario puslinch name change","story":"Case of street named in the 1920s ides Ontario town of Puslinch, as some condemn offensive symbol and others say it’s part of historyA street named Swastika Trail has sparked a polarising debate in a small Canadian municipality, where residents have taken their cause to court after a months-long campaign to change the name proved fruitless.After years of quietly complaining about the name, a group of residents in the tight-knit southern Ontario township of Puslinch, population 7,300, launched a campaign last autumn aimed at convincing their neighbours that it was time for change.Some living on the private road were uneasy about having it listed on their driver’s licenses and other government documents. Others said it was simply time to untangle the municipality from the offensive symbol. Their view was countered by those who argued that the street had been named in the 1920s, when swastikas were associated with peace rather than a symbol of Adolf Hitler, the Nazi party and white supremacy. Others cited the personal expenses that those living on the street would be forced to incur if they had to change their address on all of their documentation. Soon after, a local association put the issue to a vote. By a slim majority – 25 votes to 20 – residents voted to keep the name. “It’s 100 years old. It’s our township’s history,” Lori Wyszynski told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in December. “I’m tired of this world – what we’re living in right now – and everyone (saying), ‘Let’s smash the statues, let’s change the school names, let’s just burn history books.’” The municipal matter soon spilled on to the national stage, after B’nai Brith Canada launched a petition urging authorities to rename the street. “There is no place for a street with the name of a symbol of antisemitic hatred in modern Canada,” Michael Mostyn of the organisation said this week in a statement. After a December council meeting that heard from 14 delegations, councillors in Puslinch Township voted 4-1 not to intervene in the matter, citing the vote that had already been held by residents. On Tuesday, two residents of the municipality sought to overturn that decision, filing an appeal with the Ontario court of justice. “We were just out of options,” Randy Guzar, a resident of the street and one of the lawsuit’s applicants, told the Cambridge Times. “Having this name in contemporary society is just completely unacceptable to us. In fact, it’s a name drenched in evil.” Their appeal argues that township’s authorities were wrong to rely on the vote held by residents, alleging in court documents that it was rife with procedural errors and bias.Puslinch Township council and the local group that held the vote, Bayview Cottagers Association, have 30 days to respond to the legal challenge. The road in Puslinch is not the province’s only reference to the symbol northern Ontario is home to the small town of Swastika, incorporated in the early 1900s and named after a local gold mine that embraced the symbol as one signifying good luck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d04dde8fc198106bbd6bef6a21d11fa58d235b6b/292_0_3571_2143/master/3571.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d57b9407f866791e0d471dcfcd638111 1240w","title":"theresa may apologise commonwealth uk historic wrongs emily thornberry","story":"Labour’s Emily Thornberry says PM should say sorry for past mistakes of Britain overseasTheresa May should apologise to Commonwealth leaders for past failures by the British government, the shadow foreign secretary has said.Emily Thornberry said Margaret Thatcher had ignored efforts by every other Commonwealth member to bring apartheid to an end in South Africa in the 1980s.Thornberry also urged the prime minister to support other Commonwealth members in their efforts to right the “historic wrongs” of the Chagos Islands.A Commonwealth summit is to be held in London this month.In an article for the House magazine, Thornberry said: “This week would be an appropriate moment to correct that historic mistake, and would send a wider signal to our Commonwealth cousins that we in the UK truly recognise that the days are gone when our union was described – in colonial terms – as the ‘British Commonwealth’.“This great institution does not exist for the benefit of Britain, and even less simply to make up for the post-Brexit hole in our trading balance sheet. It exists for the collective benefit of all its members, and the wider benefit of the world.”Last year, 33 Commonwealth countries, led by Mauritius, voted to refer Britain to the international court of justice over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean.The territory has been a contentious issue for years, with most of its 1,500 inhabitants deported so that the largest island, Diego Garcia, could be leased to the US for an airbase in 1971.Thornberry said the government must listen to its Commonwealth partners and “correct the historic wrong done by our country to the people of the Chagos Islands”.She added: “That is how I would urge the prime minister to approach this summit, and – in that same spirit – I would like her to start it by saying sorry to the other heads of government not just for the wrong done to the Chagos Islanders, but for the actions of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.“Back then, it was nothing less than our duty to take part in collective action against South Africa, and heed the urgent calls from our Commonwealth partners for the unified imposition of sanctions. But instead, the Thatcher government dismissed them.“The last prime minister, David Cameron, apologised directly to Nelson Mandela in 2006 for his party’s refusal to impose sanctions, but that did not go far enough.“I believe Theresa May and the Conservative government in Britain also owe an apology to the Commonwealth as a whole – and indeed Her Majesty The Queen – for ignoring the efforts of every other member 30 years ago to bring apartheid to an end.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3460178.1523569329!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"forty four schools to be built as hundreds of upgrades put on hold","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSchool fees: new primary schools typically cost about €6.5 million new secondary schools cost more than €22 millionThe Department of Education has been forced to put hundreds of applications for major school refurbishments on hold amid pressure to build new schools for a growing population.Minister for Education Richard Bruton will today announce that 44 new schools will be built, mainly in the Greater Dublin Area, to meet the needs of an additional 20,000 pupils. But internal records show that some 575 applications for major refurbishments from schools have been put on hold.With thousands of additional school places needed nationally over the coming years, the department is now building more school places than during any other period in the history of the State. There is concern, however, over the state of existing schools that are ageing and in need of refurbishment. Department records estimate that some 70 per cent of primary schools and 80 per cent of secondary schools are at least 25 years old.A briefing note on planned capital expenditure over the next decade states: “There are in the region of 575 school applications for major refurbishments on hand which the Department has not been able to prioritise due to the current focus on additionality.”Many of these schools say they are struggling with outdated facilities or prefabs and have had applications for facilities such as PE halls turned down.Although plans to end the long-term use of prefabs were announced in 2015, latest figures indicate the number of rented prefabs has increased by 25 per cent between 2016 and 2017. A department spokeswoman said funding under the new 10-year National Development Plan will allow for a “significant focus on refurbishments in the second part of the decade”. In the meantime, she said, grant schemes will be available to support smaller-scale and more urgent refurbishment projects.The department is under acute pressure to keep pace with the growing school population over the coming years. Primary enrolments are set to peak this year, while the number of young people at second level is set to reach an all-time high by 2025. This will see enrolments at postprimary level exceed 400,000 students for the first time.Internal records also state the cost of building new schools is likely to rise significantly given that most are needed in urban areas. New schools typically cost about €6.5 million at primary level and more than €22 million for a new 1,000-pupil secondary school.Mr Bruton said if Ireland wanted to be “the best in Europe, we need to make sure that we are planning for future need and providing state-of-the-art facilities for future generations”. He said the 26 new primary schools and 16 secondary schools being announced today, along with school extensions, will meet our education needs over the next four years.In general, most new schools will be established on sites that are owned or bought by the State, while patron bodies be responsible for running them. Parents in areas where the 44 schools are due will be given a chance to register their preferred patron body through a new online system, and to express their preference of education through English or Irish.Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman, Thomas Byrne, said that although Mr Bruton spoke about having the best education and training system in Europe, his capital budget was “increasing pressure, and he is doing little about it”. He added: “Land costs, building costs and school-age population are all up substantially. However, the increase in the capital budget for schools has not matched these rises.”Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Mary Crilly says \u0026lsquoit\u0026rsquos not an isolated incident in terms of how some young boys view girls\u0026rsquoMan, is in his mid-40s, seen in difficulty in water at about 4pm on ThursdayZappone says organisation\u0026rsquos handling of rape allegation is \u0026lsquovery concerning\u0026rsquoUCD-TCD science team disagree with \u0026lsquopessimistic\u0026rsquo DNA-test findings of expert groupSmall bone samples can reveal identities of mother-and-baby-home remainsForensic DNA analysis must be pursued, says the Tuam Babies Family Group\u0026lsquoConduct issues\u0026rsquo of players raised during Belfast rape trial is part of \u0026lsquointernal review\u0026rsquoGovernment report says increased costs mean any higher is less appealing to developersGermany wants to avoid even \u0026lsquoa glimmer\u0026rsquo of a hard border emerging in IrelandAlmost one-fifth of mothers in Belfast research report history of mental disorderOver 40 schools due around Ireland, with places for 20,000 pupils to be built by 2022Population bulge sees new schools top agenda as 575 refurbishments stalledDIT journalism head speaks at event hosted by RT\u0026Eacute Audience Council at Trinity College, DublinGarda, Prison Service and Inspector of Prisons inquiries will seek to determine factsIan Marshall\u0026rsquos invitation to contest byelections at end of month came from VaradkarGarda\u0026iacute notified as Davis College principal says school taking issue \u0026lsquoextremely seriously\u0026rsquoObstetrician warns of \u0026lsquoserious dangers\u0026rsquo when women take abortion pills without supervisionMichael O\u0026rsquoDwyer died of a single stab wound to his chest, State pathologist saysDavid Drumm trial: Banker said ILP would be \u0026lsquomassively exposed\u0026rsquo if deal not recordedSinn F\u0026eacutein calls on group to \u0026lsquodisband and get off the back of the community\u0026rsquo in Northern IrelandThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3460155.1523567060!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"scouting ireland s 1m in state funding to be withheld","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tScouting Ireland received €876,337 in funding from the department last year, and more than €9 million since 2010. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsState funding of nearly €1 million a year is to be withheld from Scouting Ireland until concerns over the governance of the organisation are resolved, Minister for Children Katherine Zappone has said.Ms Zappone said she was “very concerned” with the organisation’s handling of an allegation made by a female leader in 2016 about a rape during a camping trip seven years earlier.“In light of the serious nature of recent media coverage the Minister has decided to withhold funding from Scouting Ireland until such time as she is satisfied with the governance of the organisation,” a spokesman for Ms Zappone told The Irish Times.Scouting Ireland received €876,337 in funding from the department last year, and more than €9 million since 2010. The organisation has 40,000 juvenile members, and grants from the department make up a significant portion of its income.There was particular concern that despite advice from gardaí, the alleged offender was reinstated without undergoing Garda vetting. The man had been suspended while the investigation was being conducted.The male leader was reinstated last year, after the Director of Public Prosecutions did not proceed with the case. He was promoted to a more senior role after a number of months.Details from the confidential review into the handling of the case, carried out by child safety expert Ian Elliott, were reported yesterday by The Irish Times.The decision to withhold future State funding until governance concerns are resolved is likely to provoke internal turmoil ahead of the organisation’s national council on Saturday.A spokesman for Ms Zappone said she was not previously aware the male leader had been reinstated “without further Garda vetting” nor of the inidual’s “subsequent promotion”.A summary of Mr Elliott’s review, obtained by The Irish Times in February, found the handling of the rape allegation was “deeply flawed”. In early March, Ms Zappone received a requested copy of Mr Elliott’s report into Scouting Ireland’s safeguarding policies.However, Scouting Ireland chief executive Dr John Lawlor said the case review was being withheld, due to an ongoing independent investigation into its findings, which “we are very anxious not to prejudice”, he said.Correspondence between Ms Zappone and Scouting Ireland was obtained under the Freedom of Information act.Dr Lawlor has agreed to appear before the Oireachtas committee on Children and Youth Affairs to answer questions on the organisation’s child protection standards. Committee chair Alan Farrell TD said he was “deeply concerned” with the details of Mr Elliott’s review.Mr McCann, who is running unopposed for a second term as chief scout at the organisation’s national council, criticised the legitimacy of the internal group’s recommendation, stating it was “an ad hoc team of senior personnel”, in a statement to the organisation’s membership on Wednesday.The crisis group “had no role, authority or mandate to make any recommendation”, he said.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3460020.1523560767!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ulster rugby and irfu officials under pressure from sponsors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaddy Jackson was cleared of the charges on March 28th. Photograph: PacemakerUlster Rugby and IRFU officials are coming under increasing pressure from sponsors to effectively deal with “issues” raised during the trial of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding. Official Ulster Rugby shirt sponsor Bank of Ireland (BoI) has said it is “highly concerned” about the “serious behaviour and conduct issues” that emerged in the trial involving the two players, who, at Belfast Crown Court last month, were cleared of raping the same woman in 2016.The bank, a key sponsor of the club for 20 years, has been in touch with Ulster Rugby chief executive Shane Logan regarding the case.“It is of paramount importance to Bank of Ireland that our sponsorship activity aligns with and supports our core values, and reflects positively on Bank of Ireland through association,” a BoI statement said. “We understand that an internal review is under way. We expect this review to be robust, to fully address the issues raised, and that decisions will be taken – and policies and protocols be put in place – that fully address the issues that have arisen.”Following the conclusion of the trial on March 28th when both men were cleared of all charges, and two of their friends were also acquitted on related charges, Ulster and the IRFU said they were conducting an internal review into the two players who have been “relieved of all duties” since the legal process began. The degrading and offensive WhatsApp messages exchanged between the players and their friends, including another rugby player Craig Gilroy, who is also subject to the internal review over a message he sent Mr Olding, were under intense scrutiny during the trial and since its conclusion.Street demonstrations have taken place in cities across Ireland, and a feminist protest planned for outside Ulster’s King Stadium in south Belfast is scheduled for Friday evening. King, which is headquartered in Cavan, is the main sponsor of Ulster Rugby. It has been a partner since 1999 and in the summer of 2014 announced a 10-year agreement for the naming rights of the stadium. A spokesman for the company did not respond to a number requests for a statement. A spokeswoman for main kit sponsor Kukri Sports said: “I have no comment.”A spokeswoman for another official shirt sponsor, BT, said: “As a sponsor of the team, we have been in contact with Ulster Rugby. “We note that the players concerned will continue to be relieved of all duties while the IRFU and Ulster Rugby internal review is under way, and we await the findings.”A spokesman for shirt sponsor Go Power said: “Our legal team have been liaising with their PR department.” All other “official” or “domestic” sponsors listed on the Ulster Rugby website were contacted by The Irish Times on Thursday. SONI (System Operator for Northern Ireland) spokeswoman Natasha Sayee said its concerns had been expressed to Ulster Rugby and it awaited the outcome of the review. “As sponsors of the Ulster Rugby Premiership, we seek to support the values of respect, integrity and inclusivity at community and grassroots level,” she said. “It is vital to SONI that the outcome of the review addresses all of these issues.”Danske Bank is the official sponsor of the Ulster Schools’ Cup competition held each year from November to March, plus the Girls Schools’ Cup and High Schools’ Trophy. A statement said: “Danske Bank has not taken a formal position on the matter, nor have we had any contact with Ulster Rugby.”A Moy Park spokeswoman said: “The company is an official supplier to Ulster Rugby. It would be inappropriate to comment further as Ulster Rugby and the IRFU are conducting an internal review.”A Dale Farm spokeswoman said: “Dale Farm fully respects Ulster Rugby and IRFU’s current internal investigation and as such is not in a position to comment on this matter.”An Ulster Carpets spokeswoman said: “Ulster Carpets are fully aware of the situation and will be awaiting the outcome of the review being carried out by Ulster Rugby and the IRFU before making any comment.”An Abbey Insurance spokeswoman said: “Thank you for the opportunity, but at this stage Abbey Insurance is not making any comment in relation to this matter.”A Deep River Rock spokeswoman said it would not be commenting on this matter.

expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroad, experts have said. Cheese producers now send around a third of their product abroad, with January 2018 seeing a 23 per cent increase in UK cheese exports compared with January of 2017, data from Dairy UK shows.English Blue Stilton cheese for sale at Broadway Market, HackneyFor example a £25m pound expansion is underway at a historic dairy in Leicestershire to meet a surge in demand for cheese from overseas. Long Clawson Dairy makes Stilton and other cheeses, and sends around 20 per cent of its products to 40 countries, including the US, Canada, China and Australia.NFU Dairy Board Chairman Michael Oakes, said cheese exports out of the UK had doubled in recent years amid a growing demand for upmarket cheeses displaying the Union jack and red tractor logo. \u0026quotThere is a growing trend for cheeseboards within fine dining experiences, particularly in the US and Japan. A cheese course is typically enjoyed with wine and is very much a luxury experience involving high quality, strong tasting cheeses. \u0026quotDiners very much want to see the traditional cheese names like Stilton and red Leicester, and they want to see the Union Jack and Red tractor logos. Its a similar effect as Belgian or Swiss chocolate over here, it has that air of luxury, it is a status symbol.

According to reports in the US, the targets selected include two Syrian airfields, a research centre and a chemical weapons facility.The dialogue between Washington and Moscow is understood to have enabled the Prime Minister to assure her Cabinet that adequate plans are now in place to restrict the fallout from any British participation in military strikes on Syria.During a two-hour emergency Cabinet meeting, Mrs May secured the backing of ministers to join an international response “to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime”, Downing Street said.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister spoke to President Trump about Syria this evening.  “They agreed that the Assad regime had established a pattern of dangerous behaviour in relation to the use of chemical weapons.  “They agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged, and on the need to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.  “They agreed to keep working closely together on the international response.”Mr Trump - who had warned Russia on Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” - toned down his rhetoric on Thursday by saying that a missile strike could be “very soon or not so soon at all”.The White House said \u0026quotno final decision\u0026quot had been made on Syria in a statement issued after the NSC meeting, adding that intelligence was still being assessed. The statement added that Mr Trump will talk to Mrs May and Emmanuel Macron, the French President, to discuss the next steps. David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, who voted against military action in Syria in 2013, signalled before the Cabinet meeting that Mrs May had satisfied him adequate planning had been carried out.He said that when David Cameron proposed military action five years ago he failed to provide the “evidence and intelligence” to justify strikes, and also did not have “a proper plan which was thought through properly”.Affected Syrian kids wait to receive medical treatment after Assad regime forces allegedly conducted poisonous gas attack to Duma town of Eastern Ghouta in DamascusMr Davis added: “Those two things I’m assured we’re going to answer today.”Britain’s ambassador to the United Nations said on Thursday that there must be “meaningful consequences” for those who use chemical weapons, signalling Theresa May’s resolve to join the international response.Downing Street said that the Cabinet - all of whom spoke during the meeting - “agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged”.The Cabinet also agreed on “the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress”, helping make the legal case for taking military action without the backing of the UN.The US is moving ten warships and two submarines into position armed with up to 700 Tomahawk cruise missiles, while Theresa May has ordered at least one British submarine to the area with a capability to fire up to 38 Tomahawks against Assad regime targets.Before chairing the meeting of his National Security Council President Trump said: “We’re having a number of meetings today. We\u0027re looking very, very seriously, very closely at that whole situation. We\u0027ll see what happens, folks, we’ll see what happens…“Now we have to make some further decisions. They\u0027ll be made fairly soon.\u0026quot He added that: “It\u0027s too bad that the world puts us in a position like that.\u0026quotNBC reported that US officials have found chlorine and a \u0026quotnerve agent\u0026quot present in blood and urine samples from victims of last Saturday’s attack on Douma, Eastern Ghouta.The Assad regime is known to have stocks of the nerve agent sarin, and has previously used a mixture of chlorine and sarin in attacks, according to US officials.Meanwhile Mr Macron is expected to join any allied response, said he had “proof” that the Syrian Government had used the chemical weapons.Speaking at a meeting of a UN committee on chemical weapons, Karen Pierce, the British ambassador to the UN, said: “We stand on the cusp of a nightmare – where weapons of mass destruction are used with impunity.\u0026quotIt is not enough just to condemn this. We need to find a way to take meaningful action and ensure that there are meaningful consequences for perpetrators.\u0026quotWe have all benefited from the international order that has kept us safe since the end of World War II. It behoves all of us to make every effort to uphold this international architecture.\u0026quotThe Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, confirmed that Russia and the US were talking on a “deconfliction line” set up in 2015 to co-ordinate air strikes, which operates between US central command in Qatar and Russia’s equivalent in Syria.He said: “The line exists and it is active. In general, the line is used by both sides.”The affirmation by Mr Putin\u0027s spokesman that communications with the United States were ongoing showed “they understand there\u0027s danger and are trying to avoid it,” according to defence analyst Alexander Golts.The US gave Russia around 90 minutes warning for a strike with 59 Tomahawks against the Shayrat airbase in April last year after another chemical weapons attack.US-Russia weapons in SyriaThe respected Kommersant newspaper in Russia reported that Russia “is expecting to receive coordinates of the targets at which the United States is planning to launch strikes”.Russia\u0027s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the priority in Syria was “to avert the danger of war”. Following a closed-door meeting of the Security Council he was asked if he was referring to a war between the United States and Russia and said: \u0026quotWe cannot exclude any possibilities unfortunately.\u0026quotJeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, insisted that Parliament must be “consulted” on any decision to take military action.He said: “Surely the lessons of Iraq, the lessons that came there from the Chilcot report, are that there has to be a proper process of consultation. Just imagine the scenario if an American missile shoots down a Russian plane or vice versa. Where do we go from there?”The Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Parliament “can and should be recalled immediately” to vote on the issue.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday evening: \u0026quotPresident Trump just finished a meeting with his National Security team to discuss the situation in Syria. No final decision has been made.\u0026quotWe are continuing to asses intelligence and are engaged in conversations with our partners and allies.

More of us are getting beyond our eighties, so we have got those people who need support and who are still with us.\u0026quotPeople planning to stop work this year expect to give their families £360 a month on average, a total of £4,320 after tax in a year. One in five said they handed out £500 a month on average to family members. Much of the money is going to fund university fees and living costs, with 23 per cent of people saying the cash was used for this. Another 22 per cent were helping family members buy a home, while 27 per cent were helping with everyday costs such as food and travel. A minority of retirees - one in four - said they had a family but did not provide them with any financial support. Women were slightly more generous than men, and said they expected to provide an average of £374 a month to family members, £25 more than the average for men. .html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}I think the parents and grandparents who have that money are feeling that they don\u0026#x27t want to go to their grave in a gold-lined coffin.High house prices compared to salaries leave many millennials unable to buy without financial help from parents or grandparents. The average first-time buyer is now in their early 30s, compared to just 23 in 1960. Figures released last year by Legal \u0026amp General suggested that the “bank of Mum and dad” now helps to fund a quarter of house purchases, lending more than £6.5bn to help younger relatives buy a home. Some parents and grandparents could also be spending more money on their children’s education following changes to funding rules which have replaced non-repayable maintenance grants with loans.Mr Russell added: “The 2018 generation of retirees have benefited to a large extent with the property boom, with stock market booms, with having final salary pension schemes. \u0026quotFewer and fewer of the future generation, unless they’re in the public sector, will have that secure high level of income.\u0026quot\u0026quotI think the parents and grandparents who have that money are feeling that they don\u0027t want to go to their grave in a gold-lined coffin, they\u0027re quite happy to help where they can.\u0026quotItaly the weak link as West forges Syria planAlfie Evans: Police called as hundreds stage protest outside hospitalRussia warns the US that Syrian airstrikes could spark warFriday the 13th: How cyclones, a Buckingham Palace bombing and asteroids have fed the paranoiaGrenfell: Ten months after the tragedy, what\u0026#39s become of the survivors?\u0026#39There will be no negotiation strands\u0026#39: Brussels crushes Davis hopes for detailed trade talks before BrexitUS-Russia ‘hotline’ for Syrian air strikes could help avoid conflict escalatingSir Tim Laurence on shaking up English Heritage -

In the last year, bitcoin has risen by over 500 per cent in value.At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at around $7,700 on the Coinbase exchange.In recent weeks, bitcoin has slowly fallen in value amid fears that the highs seen in late 2017 were the result of a bubble. At its peak last December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000.Other leading cryptocurrencies have mirrored bitcoin\u0027s return to form, with ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS all experiencing gains of more than 10 per cent over the last 24 hours.Bitcoin Cash feud deepens as famous @Bitcoin Twitter account mysteriouWill bitcoin recover from its worst ever start to a year?Cryptocurrency analysts recently suggested that bitcoin\u0027s recent demise was only temporary, predicting a turn in fortunes for the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency.Speaking to The Independent earlier this month, one expert said the price of bitcoin could return to its 2017 highs and even push beyond.“The price has been driven by speculators and they suddenly got cold feet but there’s considerable effort going on behind the scenes, including new underlying technology that is powering faster transactions,” said Michael Jackson, the former COO of Skype who now works in the cryptocurrency space.“Meanwhile, regulators seem open-minded and are now working to eliminate the risks for consumers. So I see no reason why bitcoin shouldn\u0027t’t fulfil its dream. And if it does then recent price falls will appear trivial.This forecast comes in contrast to comments from economists at Barclay\u0027s bank this week, which labelled bitcoin\u0027s 2017 price rise an infection that spread like a disease.Such analysis would suggest that the falling price meant the disease had been treated and gains of that scale would not be seen again.“We developed a theoretical model of an asset price with a pool of speculative investors and compared it with actual bitcoin price behaviour to see what it might imply for the future dynamics, the economists said.The model has clear parallels with compartmental models of the spread of an infectious disease in epidemiology.Follow our bitcoin live blog for the latest updates.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

A survey found 31 per cent of people are paying out £4,300 a year on average, increasing pressure on their own retirement plans and income.They are providing financial support to three people on average with their or their partner’s children the most likely (56 per cent) to be receiving money. Number of people retiring after age 70 doubles since 2010 Among those paying for younger generations, a quarter said they were giving money to grandchildren, 8 per cent to their parents and 2 per cent to their grandparents.Nearly one in five expecting to retire this year estimate they provide more than £500 a month to family members.   The money is most commonly used to cover everyday living costs such as food and travel, according to 27 per cent of those who give money monthly. However, 23 per cent say they are providing financial support to help with university education fees and living costs while 22 per cent say some of the cash goes to help with getting on the property ladder.Women are slightly more generous than men, expecting to provide an average of £374 a month to family members, compared to men who will hand over £25 less every month. Stan Russell, retirement income expert at Prudential, said that rising financial pressures such as the cost of university education and buying a home meant that providing financial support to family members continues well into retirement.  “While it’s understandable so many people want to financially support family members, it is important to make sure they have enough money set aside themselves to cover their own living costs and don’t put their retirement at risk,” he said.  The study found that a quarter of people retiring this year have families but don’t provide them with any financial support, while 43 per cent do not have any dependents.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesQuaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Flying from the US to China, for example, would only take around 30 to 40 minutes. “I’m personally invested in this one because I travel a lot, and I do not like to travel,” Shotwell said. “I would love to get to see my customers in Riyadh, leave in the morning and be back in time to make dinner.”Scientists may have discovered why there are so few aliensMr Musk has frequently expressed his ambition to send people to Mars in order to form a colony that would help sustain humanity in the event of a species-ending event, such as the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence.Such technology represents “our biggest existential threat,” Mr Musk said in 2014, adding that its development was similar to “summoning the demon.”While a human colony on the Red Planet might offer some safeguards for the future of humanity, Mr Musk says the first people to take part in Mars missions would most likely be risking their own lives.“It kind of reads like Shackleton’s ad for Antarctic explorers,” Musk told the crowd at the SXSW festival last month. “Difficult, dangerous, good chance you’ll die.

Rocket startup SpaceX wants to send humans to Mars within a decade. (REUTERSRonen Zvulun)Mr Musk’s timeline for beginning manned missions to Mars to set up a potentially species-saving colony is more ambitious than that of Ms Shotwell’s predictions. Last year, the billionaire polymath said he believed the first cargo mission to Mars would be possible in 2022, with the first manned mission following just two years after. The SpaceX founder does not always meet his enthusiastic deadlines, having struggled in the past to meet production goals with one of his other companies - electric car maker Tesla.Ms Shotwell referred to the wild timelines set by Mr Musk as “Elon time,” but said that the latest projections for achieving manned missions to Mars were from her own calculations.“That’s my time,” she said. “Not Elon time.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

A survey found 31 per cent of people are paying out £4,300 a year on average, increasing pressure on their own retirement plans and income.They are providing financial support to three people on average with their or their partner’s children the most likely (56 per cent) to be receiving money. Number of people retiring after age 70 doubles since 2010 Among those paying for younger generations, a quarter said they were giving money to grandchildren, 8 per cent to their parents and 2 per cent to their grandparents.Nearly one in five expecting to retire this year estimate they provide more than £500 a month to family members.   The money is most commonly used to cover everyday living costs such as food and travel, according to 27 per cent of those who give money monthly. However, 23 per cent say they are providing financial support to help with university education fees and living costs while 22 per cent say some of the cash goes to help with getting on the property ladder.Women are slightly more generous than men, expecting to provide an average of £374 a month to family members, compared to men who will hand over £25 less every month. Stan Russell, retirement income expert at Prudential, said that rising financial pressures such as the cost of university education and buying a home meant that providing financial support to family members continues well into retirement.  “While it’s understandable so many people want to financially support family members, it is important to make sure they have enough money set aside themselves to cover their own living costs and don’t put their retirement at risk,” he said.  The study found that a quarter of people retiring this year have families but don’t provide them with any financial support, while 43 per cent do not have any dependents.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She also highlighted the plight of refugees on Papua New Guinea\u0027s Manus Island and Nauru where Australia holds asylum seekers in refugee processing centres. Politicians and other critics accused her of politicising the day and she later removed the post.It was brought to my attention that my last post was disrespectful and for that, I apologise unreservedly,” she wrote at the time.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesShi\u0027ite pilgrims carry a symbolic casket outside Imam Moussa al-Kadhim\u0027s shrine to mark the anniversary of his death in Baghdad, IraqSeasonal winds washed tons of debris ashore at Matahari Terbit beach, near Sanur, Bali, Indonesia.Syrian onlookers gather around rescue teams clearing the rubble at the site of an explosion of unknown origin which wrecked a multi-storey building the previous night in the war-battered country\u0027s northwestern city of Idlib.

There is no dogmatism.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13He added: What creates the problem in Ireland, is the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU but also to leave what it is not obligatory to leave, that\u0027s to say the single market and the customs union.The EU said last month that it is prepared to shift its position if the UK backs down over its plans for a hard Brexit.Guidelines published by the European Council ahead of the second round of Brexit talks said their position was “compatible with the positions stated by the UK” but added: If these positions were to evolve, the Union will be prepared to reconsider its offer.Sticking to EU law \u0027vastly\u0027 better than making our own, say businessesBrexit \u0027one of saddest moments\u0027 in recent European history, says TuskEU to make UK sign pledge not to slash environment rules after BrexitBarry Gardiner describes key part of Labour\u0027s Brexit plan as b******sMr Barnier’s confirmation was welcomed by anti-Brexit campaigners.Labour MP Chris Leslie, a supporter of the Open Britain group, said: These comments by Michel Barnier demonstrate yet again how ludicrous it was for the Government to take single market membership off the table in the Brexit negotiations.Leaving the single market will lead to huge economic damage, years of austerity and will starve our public services such as the NHS of vital resources.If the cost of leaving the single market and of Brexit is too high, people are entitled to keep an open mind about whether it\u0027s the right path for the country.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If the election were held today, frankly, I think Republicans would lose both,” the conservative pollster said on Fox News.Republican governor warns party is at risk of Democratic gainsRepublican finally concedes special election in ominous sign for TrumpHillary Clinton says \u0027the Russians are coming\u0027 ahead of midtermsRepublicans fear a \u0027bloodbath\u0027 in midterm electionsAmerica’s best known public opinion guru partially heaped blame on Mr Trump for the Republican Party\u0027s dwindling electoral hopes.“If Donald Trump wants to keep the Republican Congress, he has to differentiate when he’s attacking Congress in general versus the Republicans in Congress,” he said.“Differentiate when he’s attacking the press versus when he feels he’s not getting a fair shake”.Mr Luntz argued the economy had flourished under the Trump administration but that the president failed to gain proper recognition for it. He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans.

The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesShi\u0027ite pilgrims carry a symbolic casket outside Imam Moussa al-Kadhim\u0027s shrine to mark the anniversary of his death in Baghdad, IraqSeasonal winds washed tons of debris ashore at Matahari Terbit beach, near Sanur, Bali, Indonesia.Syrian onlookers gather around rescue teams clearing the rubble at the site of an explosion of unknown origin which wrecked a multi-storey building the previous night in the war-battered country\u0027s northwestern city of Idlib.

He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.
