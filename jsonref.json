He lost his children, his wife, and his international standing after Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the Family Division, found he had conducted a ‘campaign of fear and intimidation’ against Princess Haya, forcing her to flee to London with their two children last April.         Dubai\u0027s Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (right) and his wife Princess Haya bint Al Hussein arrive for the first day of the Royal Ascot race meeting June 16, 2009The judge also found the sheikh ‘ordered and orchestrated’ the kidnap of Princess Latifa, who was snatched from a boat in the Arabian Sea in 2018. She and Shamsa are still captive in Dubai.Sir Andrew said the sheikh’s actions, on balance of probabilities, ran ‘contrary to the criminal law of England and Wales, international law and internationally accepted human rights norms’. The sheikh, who did not attend court, denies any wrongdoing. He repeatedly tried to keep the findings secret but the case was ruled to be in the public interest.Mr Beck said he had never forgotten the plight of Princess Shamsa, who ran away at 19 because of her father’s oppressive treatment of women and girls.She fled his Surrey estate, but after weeks on the run she says that after visiting a pub in Cambridge she was grabbed by four of armed heavies, injected with sedatives and taken back to Dubai.         In mid-July 2000 the ‘headstrong’ then 19-year-old princess – reportedly angry her father wouldn’t let her go to university and disgusted by Dubai’s human rights record – evaded high-security at her father’s sprawling Longcross estate (pictured) in Surrey, where the family spent most summersYesterday, both Tony Blair, who was prime minister in 2000, and Jack Straw, who became foreign secretary in 2001, denied any knowledge of the case.

This is a theoretical method of transmission – poor sanitation caused many SARS infections – but there is no evidence yet that Covid-19 has been passed on like this.HOW DOES IT MAKE US ILL?By forcing the lung cells of the infected person to replicate its RNA, Covid-19 disrupts normal respiratory functioning. This includes the constant waving motion of cilia: tiny hair-like projections in the lungs which sweep out mucus and dirt or particles that have been breathed in from the air around us.With this vital defence mechanism impaired, the lungs are more vulnerable to potentially deadly infections like pneumonia.We know that our immune systems are strongest when we are younger, so it is not surprising that children appear to be the least vulnerable to developing the worst symptoms of coronavirus.The opposite is true of elderly people, especially if their lung function is already compromised – for example, by life-long smoking or conditions like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).       In people of all ages, the symptoms can be worsened when the body’s immune system goes into overdrive in its response to infection. White blood cells dispatched to fight the virus and reduce the inflammation in the lungs can damage healthy cells in the process.The fever experienced by many victims is another immune response, with the body raising its internal temperature to a level at which the virus can no longer operate.The majority of people infected with Covid-19 will experience symptoms so mild that they will not even know that they have had the disease.WHAT IS THE VIRUS’S ‘AGGRESSIVE’ STRAIN?Viruses mutate all the time and what the Chinese scientists have identified is a minor variation (known as L-type) to the existing Covid-19 (S-type) rather than a new and insidious new virus.The word ‘aggressive’ is being used to describe it but the facts are less alarming. The S-type which kicked off the epidemic in China appears to be milder and less infectious L-type seems to be more infectious – it currently accounts for 70 per cent of cases – but does not appear to be causing symptoms that are any worse.Bear in mind that new strains of influenza are evolving constantly. That is why our annual flu jabs contain two or three different vaccines which change year on year.Any future vaccine against Covid-19 will similarly take account of the different strains out there.WILL IT DIE DOWN OVER THE SUMMER?Respiratory infections are certainly more common in winter. There is no simple explanation for this, but one theory is that viruses can survive longer in colder weather when there is less UV radiation (which can kill microbes) from sunlight bearing down on the hard surfaces on which they linger.Or it may be that people get together in confined spaces more often in winter.Whatever the explanation, there is no way of knowing what warmer weather will bring for the coronavirus. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, UK cases peaked in July.CAN YOU COMPLETELY PROTECT YOURSELF?Short of wearing a spacesuit, or stopping the people around you from breathing, the answer is no.But public health control measures proved highly effective in eradicating SARS in 20022003.Even if we are not completely rid of Covid-19, it may eventually evolve into different strains of the common cold – a recurring winter infection which many of us build immunity to, having caught it once.That said, there is no room for complacency. And if we can draw anything positive from the spread of Covid-19, it’s as a reminder that we cannot skimp on funding if science is to keep pace with the ever-evolving threats to our health both now and in the future. "},{"url":null,"title":"PLATELLS PEOPLE Boycotting Amber Rudd Oxford University just makes red","story":"Share this article That does not include their allowances for housing, gold-plated final-salary pensions and expenses.The armed forces, teachers, prison staff and police officers all got less than that, without the perks.

We had a town hall meeting with our CEO and our publisher. After we were able to raise our questions with them in a public forum, we grabbed our things and walked out.”The employee did not think the company would change course but on Friday, it did.Hachette “will return all rights to the author”, its statement said.“The decision to cancel Mr Allen’s book was a difficult one. At HBG we take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books.Hachette said it was committed to “making sure every day in our work that different voices and conflicting points of views can be heard” but also “offering a stimulating, supportive and open work environment for all our staff”.Allen, 84, denies the accusations by his daughter Dylan Farrow, which were the subject of two investigations. The director was never charged.Allen rose to fame as a stand-up comedian and comic writer and has made films for more than 50 years. He reportedly came close to publishing a memoir in 2003, reaching a deal with Penguin before changing his mind. Hachette said it made its deal with Allen last year.Hachette published Ronan Farrow’s Catch and Kill, an account of his work on #MeToo stories including the case against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of rape in New York last month.In a statement in response to news of his father’s deal, Farrow said he was “disappointed” his publisher had “concealed the decision from me and its own employees while we were working on Catch and Kill – a book about how powerful men, including Woody Allen, avoid accountability for sexual abuse”.This year, Macmillan will publish a debut novel by Dylan Farrow.In her own statement on the decision to publish her father’s memoir, she said it was “deeply upsetting to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalised on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men.”On Friday, Hachette concluded: “Over the past few days, HBG leadership had extensive conversations with our staff and others.“After listening, we came to the conclusion that moving forward with publication would not be feasible for HBG.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb5a41c0c9f92e0ebdec6975b427c66270c762f8/0_104_2410_1446/master/2410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16204b0b87df59644225cf2dfd30771f","title":"best recent poetry review roundup","story":"Zonal by Don Paterson The Martian’s Regress by JO Morgan Come Down by Fiona Sampson and Loss by David HarsentFans of Don Paterson’s lyric poetry will find his latest volume, Zonal (Faber, £14.99), something of a surprise. Often given to self-reinvention, Paterson has always kept musical panache at the forefront of his multi-award-winning verse, be it in the laddish smarts of Nil Nil, the paternal meditations of Landing Light, or the metaphysical reach of Rain. This new book is not only his most seemingly confessional, but also a stylistic departure. Taking its cues from the first season of the TV classic The Twilight Zone, its often surreal, long-lined narratives jump from funny to sad to profound with a suppleness somewhere between Frank O’Hara and CK Williams. “I am trying hard not to be that guy,” sighs the speaker in one poem, “and while I can fall prey to bitterness, I refuse to sound like some middle-aged incel addicted to Jordan Peterson videos.” The poet’s cutting wit and acute awareness aside, the best poems here are the reimagined character portraits that bookend the collection: “Lazarus”, in which self-improvement meets the Orphic contemplation of the void and “Death”, in which a self-deceiving salesman tries to buy off the grim reaper.JO Morgan won the Aldeburgh first collection prize in 2009 for a book-length poem that recounted a childhood on the Isle of Skye. In his seventh volume, The Martian’s Regress (Cape, £10), he has quietly established himself as a gifted writer of the long poem. His previous book, Assurances, was an intimate presentation of his father’s involvement in maintaining Britain’s airborne nuclear deterrent. The Martian’s Regress is an imaginative leap, in its story of environmental collapse and a fragile humanity, though it mines not dissimilar terrain in conjuring familiar dystopias: “Waking from his nightmare  The pressing blackness of the air  Failed to hide the martian from himself.  The nightmare too had woken”. In portraying the variously hopeful, hopeless, comic and bleak ways of apparent aliens, Morgan brings us closer to ourselves.Numinous musicality remains a hallmark of the former violinist Fiona Sampson’s poetry. Come Down (Corsair, £10.99) traces the meeting points of our fleeting human lives and the shifting timelessness of the world that surrounds us, be it “cool stone” as “our voices  lick at space”, or words that “make a wavering  line in snow”. Free from punctuation except for the odd dash or question mark, Sampson’s poems refuse to stay still, intent on pursuing lines of inquiry into what it all means: “Wet stone smells  of lost meaning smells  of mysterious  wise intention  the unlived-in stonework  drawing back from us”. But Come Down also faces up to precise human hurt, most hauntingly in the sexual damage of “Old Man”, and the titular long poem, exploring place, memory and the chasms of history.David Harsent is the modern master of what could be called the poem noir. His formally adept work often draws a solitary character into disturbing, half-apprehended horrors, as the human psyche casts and conjures its shadows in an unforgiving world. In Loss (Faber, £14.99), we join an eerie narrative that begins at “00:00 and the full of night to come”, as visionary insomnia engulfs a man confronting personal and public losses. While unremittingly bleak, this book-length poetic sequence is powerful in its metaphorical reach: “Children in a pool of light, a pool of dust the way  images deceive, the way time shunts and stalls, a test  of what gathers and corrupts”. Like the best poets, Harsent reminds us what it is to lose sight of ourselves, as we might “meditate  on the effect of pain but never on its cause”.• Ben Wilkinson’s Way More Than Luck is published by Seren.

It’s a brilliant graphic novel that artfully depicts the teenage angst we all know and have hated. Graphic novels can tell a story in a way that words can’t. It’s amazing how much emotion can be conveyed in those little panels – which is perhaps why some of them have been so successfully turned into movies (think Ghost World by Daniel Clowes and Watchmen by Alan Moore).Imagine my extreme delight when I saw that Bong Joon-ho, director of Oscar-winning Parasite, will be flip-reversing this and publishing the storyboards of Parasite as a graphic novel. Before shooting the movie, Bong drew every scene as he saw it in his mind. This translates to a 304-page retelling of what we’ve already seen on the screen. As someone who loves graphic novels, I’m thrilled. As someone who doesn’t know how to plan, I’m inspired. Here’s to you, Bong Joon-ho, a director who keeps reminding the west that story alone, and the various ways of telling it, can break down barriers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95e7f8a691ad3e6af55d90504359b1e5dfc377f/0_1322_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11a949ca285ac0fae19f9eca4aa3b6c3","title":"recollections my non existence rebecca solnit review","story":"The acclaimed feminist writer on her formative years, feeling silenced and the first room of her own – a light-filled flat in San Francisco One Sunday in 1980, the 19-year-old Rebecca Solnit went to see the studio flat in San Francisco that would be her home for the next 26 years. She’d been living in hostels since she moved away from her parents a few years earlier, so this was the first room of her own. She found in the corner studio in Lyon Street, with its light-filled bay windows and golden oak floors, the beginnings of an adult identity. She filled the space with things collected on walks – lichen-covered twigs, birds’ nests, bones – and with old furniture and books. She didn’t yet know that she was a feminist or a writer but she knew that she was a reader and that she was outraged by the expectations of the men around her, whether it was the male poets seeking a muse or the men who followed her in the street, making her panic that she could end up as one of the women she read about in news reports: “beatnik girl slain by sailor looking for love”.Recollections of My Non-Existence announces itself as a memoir that will reveal how this skinny, friendless girl found her voice and her place in the world. There’s a lot of first person writing across Solnit’s books. She has always used her own experience, describing herself walking across cities and deserts, or evading the violence or speechifying of men. And her take on culture is original enough that it wouldn’t be surprising if her take on memoir was original too. But this book feels a little thin, because she’s not an introspective writer. She’s not curious about the relationship between thoughts and feelings or about her own ambivalence or contradictions. There is not here the plunge inwards, the giddying rush of embodied thinking, that we get in, say, Maggie Nelson’s The Argonauts.Solnit’s title is in part an acknowledgement of this, and some of the book’s most striking passages are about non-existence. “To be a young woman is to face your own annihilation in innumerable ways,” she writes at the start, “or to flee it or the knowledge of it, or all these things at once.” There’s a personal point here. She suggests that, partly because of her violent father, she became “expert at fading and slipping and sneaking away … dodging unwanted hugs and kisses and hands … at the art of non-existence, since existence was so perilous”. She associates this, intriguingly, with her love of reading, suggesting that when she read, she “ceased to be myself, and this non-existence I pursued and devoured like a drug”. And she describes how this desire to escape coexisted with fantasies of daring combat and a preoccupation with armour. As always with Solnit, though, this becomes part of a larger political point, because she thinks, rightly, that though male violence affected her “in profoundly personal ways” the cure wasn’t a personal one but rather the public sea-change brought about by feminism. This may be true, but it doesn’t tell us much about Solnit. In the absence of introspection or of a detailed account of her early life, Solnit tells the story of male violence. This is most powerful when it’s centred on her own youthful experiences. There’s a frightening passage where she describes walking home late at night after a party followed by a large man: “His shadow and mine swelled and shrank from streetlight to streetlight, and cars passed by and their headlights made all the shadows swirl and vanish.” This scene, together with the early accounts of friend-making and city life, reminded me of Siri Hustvedt’s recent autofictional novel Memories of the Future, which describes Hustvedt’s move to her first flat in New York in 1978. A striking amount of the material is similar, from the shabby flats in run-down neighbourhoods to the in-jokes with friends and the early attempts at writing. In both cases, there’s a feeling of being silenced by men (“over and over, I have spoken and not been heard”, Hustvedt writes) and in both cases there’s a reflective curiosity about the relationship between the sexagenarian narrator and the recollected girl. Here’s Hustvedt: “I hover above the self that met and then wrote about Wanda. I am somewhere near the cracked ceiling of the shabby, nearly empty apartment.” And here’s Solnit: “that long-ago girl was not exactly me, not like me at all in crucial ways, but me anyway, an awkward misfit, a daydreamer, a restless wanderer.”The comparison helps to clarify why Solnit’s book feels a little insubstantial. In Hustvedt’s, there’s not all that much introspection, but there’s a willingness to dwell with the flat itself, to turn it into the setting of a kind of Shandean play, where the furniture, the neighbours and the visiting friends and boyfriends come alive. This makes for a more satisfyingly abundant book and allows the violent scenes (“a girl who comes with me leaves with me”, her near-rapist tells her) to provoke a more lived shock in the reader.Solnit’s book has some great moments of observation and some very fine writing. Fans will be pleased with her defence of her own meandering voice against the Hemingwayesque terseness she was taught at journalism school: “I wanted to trace the lost patterns that came before the world was broken and find the new ones we could make out of the shards.” There’s a compelling passage on penetration, where she suggests that men who see sexual penetration as a way of gaining power over women and making themselves invulnerable would do well to remember that “everyone is interdependent. Everyone is vulnerable. Everyone is penetrable, and everyone is penetrated incessantly by the vibrations of sound travelling into the inner ear.”As always, she’s brilliant on art, appreciating male artists, and especially the gay men who helped her interrogate gender norms and find a voice, at the same time as seeing the sexism of the Beat poets and artists (“how do you make art when the art that’s all around you keeps telling you to shut up and do the dishes?”), among others. There is some terrific social description of the streets surrounding her Lyon Street flat, filled with places of worship, with shops doubling as museums (there’s a dry cleaner with a display of antique irons) and bordered by a 19th-century cemetery district not long cleared of its dead. With a writer of this stature, there’s a value, too, in the signposting of her career. She shows us how she began (the journalism course coinciding with a fortuitous student job at the Museum of Modern Art), and shows us in broad brushstrokes how her books emerged from her experiences and preoccupations, as she embraced in turn environmentalism, activism and feminism.But there isn’t the determined concentration of her Wanderlust, which manages to be both compendious and wilful as a guide to walking through the ages, and in which the more angrily personal passages speak easily to the more researched, distant material. And there isn’t the fiery lyricism of A Field Guide to Getting Lost, with its sustained meditation on desire and on our longing to reach the blue hills seen in the distance, even while knowing that close up they will always be brown or green. Perhaps there was a necessary non-existence in the writing in these books that is imperilled by a memoir perhaps Solnit is rightly concerned to protect herself from the dangers that inhabiting herself too fully might entail.• Lara Feigel’s Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing is published by Bloomsbury.

Because you don’t have ideas for books.” Indeed, if one does happen to occur, then sadly, “that’s the end of that book. You have ideas for books when you finish them.” This is very much the counterintuitive, back-to-front and frankly confounding sort of thing Barry says when he’s talking about writing. I point out to him that during the course of our conversation about A Thousand Moons, his eighth work of long-form fiction and a continuation of the Costa-winning Days Without End, he has equated the process of creating a novel to being a train robber on the run to elaborating Einstein’s theories of time and to ensuring the safe return of Buzz Aldrin and his crew from the moon, in a scenario in which the novelist is at once ground control at Cape Canaveral and “also the fucking rocket”. I mean, what’s going on here?He pauses for a moment. “There may be a dog in the rocket too,” he adds, almost apologetically. “It may have snuck on.”But if this sounds like a kind of parody of haute literary pretension, I should point out that much of the time Barry is laughing, although he sometimes seems close to tears, and that I occasionally suspect him of teasing me. In fact, the two conversations we have – one in the old rectory in the Wicklow mountains that he shares with his wife, actor and screenwriter Alison Deegan, and several dogs ranging from the tiny to the enormous, and the other in the offices of his London publisher – are notable because of their swift gear changes from the silly to the serious, the light-hearted to the sad and strange.The story behind all his novels – beginning with The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty in 1998 and including Annie Dunne, the Booker-shortlisted A Long Long Way and The Secret Scripture – is one of the deliberate and careful construction of a family that would at some level stand “in place of the kind of disaster of the family I was accidentally part of originally. I mean utter disaster.” What was so disastrous about his family? “I don’t see my father. My brother has disappeared. My sister, whom I adore, lives in France. My mother was a complicated bipolar person, absolutely glorious in some ways, absolutely ... I mean, to be a child of those people.”His brother, he adds, was “a verifiable genius”, who as a young man was inundated with scholarship offers to study astrophysics in the US, and whom Barry doted on in a way that he describes as “fatherly, without the responsibility of being a father”. Later, he developed mental health issues, and Barry isn’t sure exactly where he is. About this relationship, and those with his parents, he is clear and adamant: “Some people may be more practical than me about this. But these are losses, as far as I’m concerned. All these battles were lost.”In the early 1990s, Barry and his wife had twins, who are now 27, and he felt what he terms “a sense of emergency”: “I realised I had to make some reckoning with all of that. And you know, you’ve got to call a loss a loss. It is very like accountancy.” He remembers wanting to create a family history for his children, even if they never made use of it, because it would be preferable to “the rather frightening thing I knew”.Creating – often idealising – a family tree is not uncommon. But Barry’s endeavour turned out not to be one of sanitisation rather, he notes: “I had a suspicion that it would be among the outlaws that I would find worthy family members.” His characters frequently find themselves at the interstices of history, propelled by forces unknown to them. Violence is commonplace separation, loss and madness far from unusual.Each of the novels imagines and expands on the history of one of Barry’s ancestors, about whom he often knew only the sketchiest of details. “I didn’t know anything about the woman who became Roseanne McNulty in Secret Scripture,” he recounts. “All I knew was that she was in my great-uncle’s band, and that she was sectioned for some reason. And she lived the rest of her life in an institution, and he married again. I did meet Lily from On Canaan’s Side once. She was just back for a few days from America. But I didn’t know anything about her life story. I knew one great-uncle had been murdered in Chicago. I didn’t know anything about my great-uncle in the first world war. Apparently, I had three of them.” They became one fictional character, Willie Dunne, from A Long Long Way.Another forefather, Thomas McNulty, left Ireland during the famine and found himself fighting in both the Indian wars and the American civil war. It was a story that Barry’s grandfather told him as he lay in bed as a child, he says: “It means one thing when you’re six. But it means a whole different thing when you’re 60.”In Days Without End, Barry introduced readers to Thomas, a teenager whose “entire history as a human being has been removed from him”. His family lost to the famine and his homeland ravaged, Thomas makes for the US, whereupon he finds himself enlisted in the American army, and falls in love with another soldier, John Cole. When the novel was published, Barry spoke movingly about how it was inspired by and dedicated to his younger son, Toby, who – after a period of what his parents feared was depression but transpired to have more to do with the pressure of secrecy – had told them that he was gay. The novel was, said Barry at the time, a celebration of his son, and an insistence on sexual and emotional freedom.But the book was not without its darkness. Thomas and John take in a young Lakota Native American woman, Winona, whom they love as their own child they have also been “fully complicit in the murder of her people and her family the thing is utterly disgraceful and infinitely questionable”.In A Thousand Moons, Barry gives Winona her own voice and her own story. The novel is an attempt to allow her to reckon with the violence both past and present that is done to her, her relationship with her adoptive fathers, and the development of her own sexuality.Barry is in the UK ahead of the publication of A Thousand Moons but also because On Blueberry Hill, his prison-cell play, is about to open in the West End of London. In 2017, Barry, the Irish theatre company Fishamble and the play’s cast, Niall Buggy and David Ganly, performed the piece in Mountjoy prison, Dublin Barry describes the experience of hearing prisoners cheer the actors on as being close to how he imagined Elizabethan theatre. When he reads from his prose fiction, he is strikingly performative, but novels are, of course, different from drama. How do the two work together for him?“In the theatre, every word, every sentence, every moment, has to be full of electricity it has to be all plugged in. You can’t have anything that doesn’t echo or reverberate.” He has tried to bring the same “spontaneity” to the business of writing novels the paradox is that it requires a great deal of patience. “For a year you can read and console yourself that you’re doing some work. But then you have this year of waiting. I waited for all those books – and waiting is very frightening and humiliating.”When I ask Barry how he approached the task of writing from the point of view of a young Native American woman – and especially the extent to which he worried about issues of cultural appropriation – he talks to me about his friendship with the late writer and activist Peter Matthiessen, whom he used as a model for the character Dillinger in On Canaan’s Side. Matthiessen had immersed himself in the lives and civil rights battles of the indigenous people of Dakota following the publication of Matthiessen’s book In the Spirit of Crazy Horse, the governor of South Dakota and an FBI agent involved in a notorious shootout had attempted to sue his publishers for millions of dollars, disputing his versions of events.Barry recalls Matthiessen saying to him – in words that he then transferred to the fictional Dillinger – that the most important thing we’ve been told about in our lifetime is DNA. “Because the good news is, we’re all the same family. And the bad news is, we’re all the same family. I not only fervently believe that, but I hold on to that, with every grappling hook in my possession.”“As soon as you construct, either for positive or negative reasons, isions among us, then you give rise to a history like Ireland’s history of religious wars. You give rise to my grandfather’s hatred of England he didn’t even want me to come here. ‘Is your own country not good enough for you? We fought 1916 for you … ’ All these allegiances have a wonderful side to them, a sort of gold side, but they also have this dreadful, tarnished toxic underbelly. Those ideas that are only made more murderous by insisting on the differences between us.”Winona and Thomas are, he argues, correlatives of one another their experiences of violence and dispossession relate to one another. But they are also crucially different although both the Native American and Irish populations have risen to roughly similar levels after huge depletion, the Irish have always been in the majority in their own land. “I’m highly aware of the refuge that America was for Irish people – although we were called lice and scum when we came during the famine – and for Jewish people fleeing the Shoah, for black people who were dragged there from west Africa. I understand all that.” But the phrase that has been echoing in his mind with reference to the land taken from the American Indians, especially since Trump rose to power is, “Give it back.”He brightens a little, as he thinks of the determination of those who made long journeys to safe ground, to new horizons. “I mean, we’ve got to itemise the glories of mankind,” he says, “because there’s been plenty of the other thing. You can make a fucking long list.”• A Thousand Moons by Sebastian Barry is published by Faber (£18.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Rijneveld’s response to this early confrontation with the unthinkable was not to draw a veil over it, but to build two books around it. “I think it’s unfortunate for a family to have a writer born into it,” says the 28-year-old author, serenely.In the devoutly religious rural community among which the Rijneveld family still live, the exposure was sudden and extreme. When Calf’s Caul, a poetry collection, was published in 2015, its young author was heralded in the national media as a new star of Dutch literature. More challenging still for the family was the novel that arrived three years later, De avond is ongemak, which appears in English this week as The Discomfort of Evening (Faber, translated by Michelle Hutchison), and has just been longlisted for the International Booker prize. “All the shopkeepers and the hairdresser were talking about it, but my family are too frightened to read it,” says Rijneveld, who uses the pronouns theythem.In The Discomfort of Evening, Matthies dies in a skating accident, leaving his 10-year-old sister Jas fantasising about how to prevent the family from being destroyed in the aftermath. She keeps two toads in a box under her bed, thinking that if they can be persuaded to mate, her parents might too, and everything will be all right again. Meanwhile, left to cope with the emotional turbulence of adolescence without adult support, she plays games with her surviving brother and sister that become increasingly wild and dangerous.The novel is set over the two years in Jas’s life when hormones corral children into adult sexual identities. Rijneveld resists such categorisation, self‑describing not as trans but as “in between”. “As a small child I felt I was a boy, I dressed like a boy and behaved like a boy, but children at that age are still neutral in their gender. In adolescence, when the separation became clear, I dressed like a girl and became a girl, then at 20 I went back to the boy I was at primary school.” Their middle name, Lucas, comes from an imaginary boyfriend they had as a young child. Elegantly dressed in trademark suit and braces, Rijneveld’s composure only breaks when they struggle to remember the name of the film star they aspire to be. It finally emerges in a burst of giggles: “Timothée Chalamet, star of Call Me by Your Name – I want to be a beautiful boy.”They have not yet decided whether to take hormone treatment, so when they read their work publicly it is in an unbroken voice, radiating an androgynous charm that has made them one of the poetry circuit’s rare breakout stars. “What a sweetheart,” wrote a commenter in response to a Dutch TV chatshow on the environment, in which Rijneveld signed up to the David Attenborough fan club, urged listeners to heed his warnings about the climate emergency and reported that they had never flown in a plane.Only their hands betray their other life as a one-day-a-week dairy farmer, with scrubbed nails that are bitten to the quick. “Farming keeps me grounded. The cows are my best friends I like cleaning out the stables and shovelling the shit.”This unglamorous side of farming slops through both the novel and the poems. Jas’s mother doses her children with worm medicine and slathers them with udder ointment to protect against the cold. One of the poems in Calf’s Caul is titled “Lice Mothers”. “People from the city get scared of these things that villagers think of as normal.” For example? “For example, torturing frogs – it’s not very nice but it happens and children will experiment with it.”Despite being published three years apart, the novel and poetry collection began in tandem, even sharing some lines. “The challenge was how to write them when I didn’t have many memories of my brother’s death. So I started with Matthies, and only during the writing arrived at the shape the novel has now. I saw Calf’s Caul as preparation for writing The Discomfort of Evening.”The collection, which has yet to be published in English, is full of the anxieties that Rijneveld’s chosen identity has created in a family who are god-fearing members of the Reformed church. “Papa has been searching for a daughter for years,” reads one poem. “It’s difficult for my parents to understand that I’m not the girl that they raised,” Rijneveld says. “It’s not in the Bible.”Whether the papa of the poems is any more Rijneveld’s own father than Jas’s papa in the novel is left open by a writer who admits that they regard their public identity as a performance, to be donned along with the braces. “Writing is playing with who you are. Being an author makes me feel more confident.”Rijneveld was born on 20 April 1991 on a farm in the north Brabant, a province in the south of the Netherlands. The date is significant, they disarmingly disclose, because it means they share a birthday with Adolf Hitler. “As a child I thought it was a funny idea to be born on the same day as such a monstrous man, but it made me wonder if I was a good or a bad person.” In the novel, Jas builds a fantasy about a Jewish family her mother has hidden away in the basement. She acts out her social alienation by making a Nazi salute at school and cracking a joke which was judged too offensive for the English edition of the novel.It’s part of a strand of black humour that is as dangerous in its way as the children’s games (one gruesome scene involves a dummy cow and an insemination gun). Asked why the novel pushes so hard at boundaries of what is acceptable, the author shrugs: “It is related by a child and children are naive. They say these things. They don’t know any better, so they can get away with an innocent joke.”At nine years old, Rijneveld says, “I had a very strong belief in God and was convinced he was living in the attic.” The novel is full of glimpses into what it was like growing up in a strict religious household. Jas’s father restricts their TV channels for fear of nudity, which he pronounces “as if a fruit fly had just flown into his mouth – he spat as he said it” her mother daringly watches a quiz show involving words that are not in the Bible. “She called them ‘blush words’ because some of them made your cheeks turn red.” When her children try out these words, she attempts “to wash them out of our mouths with a bar of green soap, like the grease stains from our good school clothes”.Of their own experience Rijneveld simply says: “Behind the book is such a strong force. After leaving school I didn’t know what to do. I started living in a room in a new city and I just knew I had to write it. In daily life it’s hard to be as strong as I am behind my laptop.” They now live in Utrecht, and work on a farm that is not their parents’.There are only two responses to the death of a child, Rijneveld says: either it draws a family closer or rips them apart. So what happened in their own family? “I have to think about the answer to that … ” Rijneveld says solemnly. “No, it hasn’t torn us apart, but all the relationships changed.” One brother and sister are now teachers, and a second brother is in the police. None of them has read the novel. “I hope that my parents will read it one day and be proud that they will understand it’s a novel, it’s not all about them. But it is probably too soon.”Meanwhile Rijneveld’s writing has gained them a new cultural family, which stretches beyond the Netherlands to Italy and Germany. Calf’s Caul has gone through 11 editions to date in Dutch while The Discomfort of Evening has sold 55,000 copies in the Netherlands it will be published in French in April and is currently being translated into Spanish, Korean, Chinese and Arabic. A second poetry collection is already out, and Rijneveld is working on a second novel. All of which bears out their fervent belief that “there’s always light in darkness, just as there’s always humour in gruesomeness. It’s just the way things work. There must always be something to laugh about.” Claire Armitstead• Marieke Lucas Rijneveld’s The Discomfort of Evening, translated by Michelle Hutchison, is published by Faber in the UK and out now.As a young man travelling around Europe in the late 1990s, the Malmö-based writer Andrzej Tichý remembers telling friends about the conditions endured by marginalised groups in Sweden. “And they just would not believe me,” he recalls. “From the outside Sweden was this harmonious, social democratic paradise and people preferred to believe the folk hymn that here was a society that looked after everyone. But it was never actually true.” He cites historic state-sanctioned forced sterilisations of those deemed to be mentally or physically impaired, and discrimination against Jews, Roma and indigenous peoples. “And there has always been the day-to-day treatment of the poor and of immigrants, let alone the junkies and criminals,” he adds. “Of course there were places in the world that were worse, but Sweden was never perfect.”The poor and the immigrants, the junkies and the criminals, loom large in Tichý’s prize-winning novel Wretchedness (Eländet, translated by Nichola Smalley) which will be published in the UK in June by And Other Stories. It is his fifth novel, but the first to appear in English, and opens with a cellist on his way to a classical concert being asked for money by a drug addict on the street. The encounter summons a swirling sequence of flashbacks from the cellist’s own chaotic past. Graphic depictions of crime, racism, poverty, drug use and violence are rendered through paragraph-free slabs of text that propulsively veer between voices and minds, times and locations: “Suddenly my mouth is full of it again,” the musician declares, “of names and places, of events and movements, of memories and images.” The inescapable realisation is how easy it would have been for him to have become that junkie.Tichý was born in Prague in 1978 to a Czech father and Polish mother. His family moved to Sweden when he was three, and he was brought up on a Malmö housing estate with a large migrant population not unlike the one featured in Wretchedness. “I’m not interested in autobiography or autofiction, but I know there are always borderline areas between the writer and the subject and I am not a stranger to many of the things in the novel. Much comes from personal experience, although sometimes indirectly.”As well as the Swedish estates, the novel draws on Tichý’s experiences of living in Hamburg and London to paint a picture of a pan-European community of the excluded passing through squats, underground clubs, petty scams and cash-only employment.This internationalism is also reflected in the language he deploys. “A lot of it is written in a sort of slang encompassing many different languages. Some words have long been incorporated into standard Swedish, from Roma for example. But now there are also a lot of Arab words, Serbo-Croat, Polish, Spanish, Albanian. It’s all mixed together, but interestingly while one sentence can contain several different languages, people will know what you mean.”Tichý’s early creative life centered on music – playing guitar in the hardcore scene rather than classical cello – which led to him starting up fanzines for which he first wrote poetry and then prose. There is a sense of musicality inherent in the dense text of Wretchedness, as episodes from the composer’s past repeatedly return, with references ranging from Snoop Dogg and Mobb Deep’s hip-hop to the concert hall avant garde of Julius Eastman and Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi’s atonal drones. (There is a coolly eclectic Spotify playlist that accompanies the book).Literary and philosophical influences include Simone Weil and Thomas Bernhard, and Tichý admits that his is a potentially demanding kind of literature. “I sometimes go out and talk to young people on the estates, people not really interested in books, and some of them find it hard. But they are interested in the themes, which is partly why rap lyrics have always been a huge influence on me. They can be complex and sophisticated yet can describe street stuff in a wonderfully direct and concise manner and so make art out of what is thought of as low life.“That is partly my project too. I’ve always wanted to depict lives and environments under-explored by literature. These lives not only deserve to be chronicled, they deserve to be elevated.” Nicholas Wroe• Andrzej Tichy’s Wretchedness, translated by Nichola Smalley, will be published by And Other Stories in the UK in June.It is no longer the curse of the Irish author to be compared to James Joyce: these days, if they happen to be sharp, socially conscious and writing about twentysomethings living now, they will be announced as the new Sally Rooney, and also as some kind of child prodigy, even when they are well into their 20s. Naoise Dolan, 27, finds this all hilarious. “In any other career, it is completely normal to get going in your 20s – we’ve just normalised the desperate state of affairs around writing,” she says. “And the idea that young women couldn’t ever have had an emotional or interesting life, or that it’s somehow cringeworthy to capture the present moment – both are ridiculous to me.”Despite the inevitable comparisons, Dolan’s debut, Exciting Times, published in April by Weidenfeld, is more caustic and cynical than Rooney’s writing, if just as clever. It follows Ava, a 22-year-old who had “been sad in Dublin, decided it was Dublin’s fault and thought Hong Kong would help”. There she meets 29-year-old banker Julian, an only child who went to Eton. (“These were the two least surprising facts anyone had ever told me about themselves,” Ava notes.) Their relationship is sexual, if carefully ambiguous, and is built mostly on their mutual enjoyment of acidic banter over any deeply-felt romance. Ava admires Julian’s cushions and willingness to give her his credit cards his highest praise for her is that she is “good company”: “Really it was amusing that we were having sex,” Ava muses. “He was attractive and confident, whereas I was willing to centre my emotional life around someone who treated me like a favoured armrest.” When Julian temporarily moves away, Ava meets Edith, a young and wealthy Hong Kong lawyer. It is here that Dolan’s novel feels most contemporaneous all the fretting over love and class could be compared to Austen or Wharton, but her light treatment of bisexuality and polyamory is utterly 2020. Ava, Julian and Edith are never really a love triangle but a hinge, with Ava in the middle of two people who benignly tolerate each other. The only drama in their arrangement lies in the choice Ava feels she must make, despite Julian’s indifference and Edith saying things like: “I have many opinions about the nexus between monogamy and patriarchy, opinions which are available on request should they interest you.”Dolan is less interested in sexuality than in relationships: “Sexuality only affects the ability to be attracted to someone – how that manifests is more about who that person is. As a queer person, I have no understanding how it might feel different to experience heterosexual attraction, though I’m quite interested in that. But there are plenty of novels about straight people already. And I think it is more interesting to write about relationships without the assumption that it has to be a monogamous one.” She suspects older readers will be baffled by the dynamic. “There is this expectation that you should write to people who are powerful in ways that you’re not, to explain to them why you’re different. I think it’s better to just throw it out there and if they don’t like it, fine. For people my age, the most important question is: are you treating your partners well or poorly?” When in conversation with older writers, she says, “I sometimes feel like I’m trying to prove that it’s OK to write stories about people who aren’t them. It’s not a gendered thing, there is a class element too. A lot of things that we call ‘the millennial experience’ were always part of a universal experience for some social groups – middle-class people are just upset that those things are happening to them now.”Dolan grew up in Dublin, studied English at Trinity College and was published in Stinging Fly magazine – by Rooney, who was editor until 2019. (This makes Dolan “such an Irish cliche”, she says.) She was always interested in literature, but never had any aspirations to write – “firstly because it’s not financially possible for most people, and secondly, I don’t stake a significant amount of my self-image in how I relate to the modes of production. It was a hobby, not a career goal. I have a limited amount of patience for the writer-as-personality thing – it is a very mechanical and somewhat distant thing for me. I just make things up. I don’t relate to accounts that people give of being struck by ideas or their characters taking over. Writing was always just kind of something that I plugged away at.”Dolan, who is autistic, “doesn’t like talking to people”, so to get away from colleagues and students at her teaching job, she spent five months hiding in coffeeshops on her lunch breaks. “I find it easier to relate to people by thinking about why they are the way they are. I aim to observe people rather than empathise with them,” she says. And her observations are brilliant, often simultaneously comic and bleak. “Julian often reminded me to eat. It made him feel better about liking that I was thin,” Ava notes. Or, at a party: “Ralph’s girlfriend Victoria was good at wearing clothes. She was so beautiful I couldn’t see why she was talking to me. Sometimes her eyes said: I don’t know why, either.”With the emergence of Rooney, Eimear McBride, Lisa McInerney, Nicole Flattery and others, Ireland has been held up for its almost mythic ability to cultivate brilliant women writers – but Dolan puts this down to Ireland being a more egalitarian playing field than the UK. “Ireland isn’t perfect, but we still have relatively good support for the arts so literary writing doesn’t have as much of a bourgeois connotation as it does in the UK. We have a better range of writers here. UK journalists always ask the oddest questions, like, ‘have you had a job before?’ I’m a normal person – yes I have.”Dolan stopped travelling by plane in September, after the fires in the Amazon moved her to reconsider her impact on the environment. “It might hold me back from promoting the book, but to be pumping all that CO2 into the air to push a novel just seems like such a ridiculous thing. If my novel doesn’t get promoted, someone else’s will. The literary world will be much unaffected.” Her decision, she thinks, comes back to her feelings about being a novelist. “I don’t think that I’m a special person who has an innate entitlement to exist writing novels while demanding other people do less pleasant things with their time. I’m lucky to, but there are a lot of things that I’m not willing to do to keep that situation going. Flying is just one of them.” Sian Cain• Naoise Dolan’s Exciting Times is published by Orion in the UK in April.“The thing I write best,” Hassan Blasim says, “is violence.” His acclaimed short-story collections, The Madman of Freedom Square and The Iraqi Christ, are fervent, unblinking depictions of post-invasion Iraq, the country of his birth, though their violence is focused through the lenses of surrealism, humour and poignancy. The former was longlisted for the Independent foreign fiction prize in 2010, and the latter won it in 2014, becoming the first title translated from Arabic to do so.In 2000, Blasim left Iraq, where he had been persecuted for his film-making and where his writing is still banned. He spent four years walking illegally across Europe, eventually settling in Finland. His debut novel, God 99 (translated by Jonathan Wright and published in July by Comma), draws on his experience: its protagonist (called Hassan) is an Iraqi refugee attempting to establish himself as a writer in Finland. But he stresses that “the book puts reality and fiction in dialogue. Autobiography is a fiction – we lie about things we misremember and misrepresent. So too fiction has truths. Luckily, I’m not famous enough for people to know my life, so I can still play with it.”God 99, he says, is “born of dialogue – always in conversation are death and life, war and peace”. In the novel, Hassan traverses Europe and interviews 99 refugees, examining the effect of war on their lives, and their impact on the countries they make home.Blasim is ambivalent about the label “European writer” – more ambivalent than he is about “debut novelist”, which he flatly rejects (“I just write. This shift to long-form is not important”). In his mind, his identity is simply “writer”. “In England,” he says, “and other parts of western and southern Europe, you have a history with immigrants. In Finland, it’s relatively new, and while some people embrace me as a Finnish writer, others resist.” Because he writes in Arabic, he is ineligible for Finnish literary prizes, and cannot join the Union of Writers.This context, combined with censorship of his work in the Middle East, means translation into English has been vital. But although Blasim attributes his success to translation, he stresses that it was never something he sought: “When I came to Europe, I didn’t know where to go. I had this romantic idea of reaching France, because of the literature. But you just go wherever you can. How can you think about the future, when life is like this? How can you think about succeeding as a writer? About reaching English-language readers?”Translating Blasim’s work – which is as experimental linguistically as it is formally – is no light task. The Arabic of God 99 is what Blasim calls “street Arabic”, and it’s another reason he’s reviled by some in Iraq: “They call me a ‘dirty writer’ – they say that I do not respect the language. Nobody can touch classical Arabic because it is a holy language. But nobody uses holy language on the street. And when I dream it is not in classical Arabic.”Does he still feel at risk? “Of course,” he says. He has returned to Iraq only once, secretly, and does not believe he will again. But his new home in Finland is not one of undiluted Scandinavian peace he is working on a project about the Finnish far right, and confides that he fears for his safety if he publishes it. “Maybe I’ll meet you in England, a refugee again,” he says. “As a refugee, you are always between two fires. Your first home, and your new one.” Will Forrester• Hassan Blasim’s God 99, translated by Jonathan Wright, will be published by Comma Press in July.A Russian writer of Armenian origin, Narine Abgaryan is already renowned as a children’s author and blogger in Russia. Her novel Three Apples Fell from the Sky has sold more than 160,000 copies since it was first published in 2015 and won Russia’s most prestigious literary award, the Yasnaya Polyana prize (founded by the Tolstoy estate). A magical realist story of friendship and feuds, published in English this month by Oneworld, the book is set in the remote Armenian mountain village of Maran, where the villagers pick mulberries and make baklava. An ancient telegraph wire and a perilous mountain path that even goats struggle to follow is their only connection to the outside world. Abgaryan cites One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez, set in the isolated fictional village of Macondo, as her favourite book. But she was haunted by the ending of Márquez’s multi-generational saga of the Buendía family, as all traces of Macondo’s existence are wiped away. In Three Apples Fell from the Sky (translated by Lisa C Hayden), she resolved to write a fable that did exactly the opposite. “I wanted to write a story that ends on a note of hope,” she says. “Humanity is in dire need of hope, of kind stories.”“We live such fast-paced lives, barely managing to speak to one another, to ask how things are going,” she says. “The thing that bothers me is how young people are leaving their elders behind.” Abgaryan, who now lives in Moscow, points to how the villagers in her novel spend their days “cultivating wine that nobody wants or needs”. “Globalisation has benefits, of course, but also negative side-effects, when national customs, the things which define people, are taken away.”Her work has already been translated into 12 languages, and with English being the 13th, she now calls this her lucky number. “When you’re published in English there’s a greater chance that your work will resonate more widely,” she says. “When your work is translated, you start to work with greater joy and hope. You start to believe in yourself more.” Jade Cuttle• Narine Abgaryan’s Three Apples Fell from the Sky, translated by Lisa C Hayden, is published by Oneworld and is out now.Pauline Delabroy-Allard’s first novel took the French literary world by surprise. She wrote it to get the story out of her head and then stuck it in a drawer. “I didn’t expect anyone would want to publish it.” A few months later, with her 30th birthday approaching, she decided she had nothing to lose by posting the manuscript to a few French publishers. “I told myself I would get a load of rejection letters and then I could stop dreaming and get on with my life.” When publishers began calling the following week, “I thought someone was playing a joke”. Delabroy-Allard eventually chose Les Éditions de Minuit, whose catalogue includes the writers she most admires, including Annie Ernaux and Marguerite Duras. “I signed the contract on my 30th birthday. That was a real party.”Ça raconte Sarah (All About Sarah) won a literary award even before it was published in 2018 to almost unanimous praise. The book was shortlisted for a the Prix Goncourt, the most prestigious literary award in France. Translated into English by Adriana Hunter and published this month by Harvill Secker, it is a story of desire and desolation. Its narrator is a bored secondary school teacher and single mother in Paris whose comfortable but humdrum life is upended when she falls in love with Sarah, a professional musician, who is loud and impetuous.The narrator and Sarah embark on an all-consuming, passionate relationship. The first part of the novel concludes when they separate and Sarah reveals she has breast cancer. In the second part, the narrator flees Sarah’s apartment, telling nobody and leaving her child behind. It is unclear whether Sarah has died or dumped the unnamed narrator, who descends into despair.Like the book’s narrator, Delabroy-Allard is a teacher, has a daughter and is in a relationship with a professional violinist called Sarah. But that is where the similarities end, she insists. “I’m not bothered if people think it’s me, but it isn’t. I find it difficult to invent things from nothing, so I use reality as a base. Once I have that base I can create the rest.”She says she left Paris to live in isolation in the countryside to complete the second part of the novel. “It was very hard being in her head – almost physically painful. I was happy to finish it.” She is now working on a second novel that she is racing to complete before she and her pregnant partner have a baby in July. The 31-year-old says she wanted to write about a passionate relationship between two women because there are so few “lesbian novels”. “But really this is a portrait of one woman, because everything we know of Sarah is through the narrator and in the second part there is no Sarah.”The novel ends leaving readers in limbo. “Several editors wanted me to rewrite it, but I didn’t want to change it. Everyone is free to imagine their own ending.” Kim Willsher• Pauline Delabroy-Allard’s All About Sarah, translated by Adriana Hunter, is published by Harvill Secker on 12 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf975a86a3181548971868d2ec421fd43befeb0d/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=542548b439be9dcd49e2dd53aa15d67e","title":"coronavirus joe biden epidemic washington obama","story":"Suddenly being the experienced Washington insider who was number two to Obama could be more of an asset than a liabilityJoe Biden is a candidate whose performance on the stump ranges from badly flawed to awful. He is a meandering, unfocused speaker, often unable to complete a sentence, let alone a thought, with a record in office that is decidedly patchy, marred by several past positions he struggles to defend. And yet Biden is now the frontrunner for his party’s nomination to take on Donald Trump. What’s more, the current mood, and specifically the threat of coronavirus, might just turn his defining weakness into a strength – and give him a serious shot at the White House.I saw his limitations for myself last month in Hudson, New Hampshire, as he paced around a high school gymnasium delivering a rambling monologue that suggested a politician well past his prime. Stronger on autobiography than policy, he strung together childhood memories, mottos taught him by his father and a kind of perplexed outrage that Trump’s America was not a country he recognised any more: “What’s this all about?” he asked, as if befuddled. “What do we stand for?” In New Hampshire, he finished fifth.Yet in the last seven days Biden has staged what is surely the most remarkable turnaround in modern US political history, a massive win in South Carolina setting off a chain reaction that brought victories across the south and midwest on Super Tuesday. Only Bernie Sanders now stands between Joe Biden and the nomination, with the map of upcoming primary contests tilted in the latter’s favour.Sanders likes to say it was the “political and corporate establishment” that handed victory to Biden, but that’s a stretch. For one thing, the Biden campaign was all but broke going into Super Tuesday, outspent by Sanders by a ratio of seven-to-one (and outspent by Mike Bloomberg by 100-to-1). Biden had only a skeletal presence on the ground, dwarfed by Sanders’ vast grassroots operation. Besides, it was not the establishment that turned out for Biden, but African-American voters – the most consistently faithful group within the Democratic coalition – who backed him over Sanders by huge, crushing margins. Along with suburban women, it was black America, not corporate America, that made the difference.There are plenty of lessons here. One is that money and organisation are not the decisive factors they were assumed to be: just ask Bloomberg, who spent $500m and won not a single state, while Biden won states he didn’t even visit. Another is that sexism and its offshoot - second-guessing other people’s sexism - pervades US politics. Elizabeth Warren was the smartest candidate in the Democratic field, the most accomplished debater and may well have made the best president, but she could not make headway. I saw part of the explanation for myself in New Hampshire, speaking to countless women who admired Warren enormously, and were desperate to see a woman in the White House, but who had ruefully concluded that their fellow citizens were just not “ready” to make that happen. They had seen how misogynistic unease with an older, opinionated woman had proved fatal to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and they were not prepared to risk a repeat of that in 2020. So they voted vote for a man instead. Perhaps inevitably, the face it chose was a familiar one, belonging to a man whom Democrats feel they’ve known for ever, whom most of them trust and like. Even the voters I met who were not backing Joe Biden described him the same way: as a “good man”, as a “really decent person”, as someone of warmth and “empathy”. Americans know the losses he has endured. His first wife and daughter were killed in a car crash when Biden was 30 his eldest son, Beau, died of cancer aged 46. Biden’s best moments in Hudson came as he listened to people talk of the pain they had endured. “Like most of you, I’ve lost a lot in my lifetime,” he said. “But I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand by and lose my country.” That ability to show basic human empathy could count in a country that is currently fearful, even bracing itself for disaster.Which brings us to the coronavirus. For four decades, the US right has had great success in persuading voters that government is the problem, not the solution. That’s found its most extreme form in Trump, elected on an implicit pledge to shake the whole thing up, if not burn it all down. He’s gutted government departments and run down federal agencies, left posts vacant or filled them with pals, cheered on by a base that for years has heard the fire-breathers of Fox News and talk radio cast “government bureaucrats” as the enemy.But how does such talk sound now, when people are trembling at the prospect of a pandemic? In a moment like this, people don’t turn against government, they turn to it. In good times, you might get applause railing against “federal officials” or “elite experts”. In a crisis, those are precisely the people with the authority to get a grip and offer reassurance.Suddenly, Biden’s 50 years as a Washington insider can be presented less as a liability than an asset, because that’s half a century of valuable experience. Better still, Biden is remembered as the number two in the most unflappably efficient administration most Americans have ever known, namely the one headed by Barack Obama. The fact that Obama chose Biden as his deputy has meant that, even without making an explicit endorsement, Obama has long served as Biden’s chief character witness. Now that line on the résumé counts for even more, with Biden’s presence in the team that presided over an economic recovery and governed with stability and calm – “No drama Obama” they called it – a prime credential.That will help Biden if he faces Trump, but it could also ensure he does. For Bernie Sanders’ brand is not one of steady calm so much as upheaval and “revolution”. That thrills his most devoted supporters but, Tuesday’s results suggest, it scares off those who yearn for stability. (At a crucial moment a fortnight ago, after he’d won in Nevada, Sanders could have moved to assuage those fears instead he reinforced them, defending his past praise for the record of Fidel Castro.) At any other time, Biden’s age, manner and CV could have doomed his candidacy. But with a plague looming, Americans might just view a flawed man of undoubted empathy and with an intimate knowledge of loss, a man who’s spent a lifetime inside the US government, as something like a remedy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a683d71411f243981ca2f6ef02c4b15a2752eb/0_121_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8efd2e96fa0bd3888d2de5a62e3ad80d","title":"labour politics of cruelty elections","story":"If you’re ever on a train going north through Wolverhampton, look out of the window just after you pull out of the station and you’ll see the privately run HMP Oakwood, one of the largest prisons in the country. It was commissioned and built by a Labour government that lost to the Tories shortly after building work began. I pass that prison – so close to the railway you can clearly see the cell windows – on the train every couple of weeks and remember that the attitude of Priti Patel didn’t come from nowhere.New Labour also built Yarl’s Wood, the immigration detention centre for women and children. It built Brook House and Colnbrook immigration removal centres, near Gatwick and Heathrow airports, and turned Dungavel open prison in Scotland into a detention facility for people refused asylum. It revoked the asylum claim of Jimmy Mubenga, who died in October 2010 after being restrained on a flight intended to deport him from the UK to Angola.Labour did these things because it had decided that voters wanted a political culture defined by its cruelty and mean-spiritedness. In so doing, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown upheld a seam of deliberate brutality, both in rhetoric and policy.In my lifetime we have seen Margaret Thatcher speaking of “holding out the prospect of an end to immigration” in 1978 and, as prime minister, declining to offer her condolences after the deaths of 13 young black people in a house fire in New Cross, London, in 1981. In 1993, John Major responded to the death of two-year-old James Bulger by insisting that “society needs to condemn a little more, and understand a little less” and refusing to stand in the way of two 10-year-old boys being tried for his murder.Then came New Labour’s attempt to elide condemnation with understanding, and what the theorist Stuart Hall called the “double-shuffle” of entrenching Thatcherite ideology under the guise of pragmatism. The more we were encouraged to believe that Labour was being as tough on the causes of crime as on crime itself, the more politics became a game of seeing what you could get away with in plain sight.HMP Oakwood is run by G4S and Yarl’s Wood by Serco, a pattern of farming out the Home Office’s dirty work that began under Labour. I can’t imagine that, on the doorstep in 1997, 2001 and 2005, anyone promised to vote for the party on the condition that prisons were privatised. Yet Labour went ahead with the policy all the same, as it did with private finance initiatives – again, was this a compelling doorstep argument? – and the continual bullying of lone parents and council tenants as though they were, by definition, among the “causes” of crime.At least for council tenants, stigmatisation brought funding. Children’s centres, new school buildings and renovations under the Decent Homes Standard made estates better places to live in than they had been. For these reasons and a multitude of others, despite Labour’s loss in the 2019 election, it’s important not to capitulate to the notion that the party’s leftward turn was a fundamental mistake. It was necessary not only for the soul of the party, but for the soul of the society we live in – the one we seek to change in part by voting.For what it’s worth, I don’t think we did “win the argument”, as Jeremy Corbyn suggested. If we’d won the argument, we wouldn’t have lost the bloody election. The argument that did win in the 2019 election was the one for cynicism. When you grow up among cynics you imbibe a sense of what causes this mindset, and what it fuels in turn. Coming from a working-class background I’m always astonished when things work out or go well, as I always expect things to go wrong. (Years of good fortune haven’t done much to change this: it’s hard to unlearn.)Translate this sense of cynicism into a political context and the kinds of defeats, both large and small-scale, experienced by anyone who isn’t from a comfortable background living in comfortable circumstances can drive votes based upon resentment and the expectation of disappointment. The rightwing press is well aware of this potential – and has constructed a worldview that takes resentment as its starting point.Yet liberal and leftwing journalists ridicule the idea that Labour might win on a platform that doesn’t pre-emptively include hanging and flogging, just in case. A sort of belt-and-braces approach: we’ll accept the green new deal as long as you promise to press the nuclear button the first chance you get. That’ll show ’em!Since the turn of the 1980s, the electorate has colluded in this game with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Cruelty and reaction are seen as a necessary pretext for political communication: all appeals to “the people” must begin from the assumption that people in general are venal, tight-fisted and vengeful. The kinder interpretation of these impulses is that people are often afraid, and that fear makes them lash out.Fear and insecurity can’t be allayed by hanging and flogging. The lesson from the Home Office, for many years now, has been that you can always get someone else to do the jobs you don’t want to do. One of those jobs is understanding how class warps society: how disappointment and struggle curdles into a resentment that can never be remedied by “giving people what they want”.Class is the dirtiest laundry of all. No one wants to hang it out, let alone attempt to clean it. The consequence is that we’re all trapped on this grim recriminatory carousel until a party or movement obtains the power, and the courage, to reject cruelty as an electoral strategy.• Lynsey Hanley is a freelance writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/068912708193baff559ffd92a4aec33664f8b4d3/5_0_1127_676/master/1127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=291d1aed6c14ee7f17e3f95968154b05","title":"ban supertrawlers from uk waters after brexit say green campaigners","story":"Environmental groups fear link between huge ships and spikes in dolphin deathsBrexit offers the perfect opportunity to ban industrial supertrawler fishing boats from UK waters, according to campaigners.The factory-sized ships can be hundreds of feet long and have been criticised for indiscriminate fishing as they catch hundreds of thousands of fish in relatively short periods. Environmentalists fear their presence correlates with spikes in numbers of dolphins washing up dead.Use of the ships is heavily regulated in some countries, as trawling has been criticised for the physical damage it inflicts on seabeds, but under the common fisheries policy, EU-registered vessels are legally entitled to fish in UK waters, subject to licence conditions, quota allocation and relevant fishing restrictions.Campaigners fear supertrawlers are incompatible with sustainable management of fisheries and argue that the UK’s departure from the EU presents an opportunity for a new approach, as fishing rights to British waters are up for review.“Our government likes to boast about its credentials as a global oceans champion, but what about protecting our seas here at home?” said Chris Thorne, Greenpeace’s oceans campaigner.“Ministers should take a long, hard look at whether allowing supertrawlers to operate in UK waters is compatible with sustainable management of our waters, as well as investigating the impact of the UK’s industrial distant-water fleet in other countries’ waters.”Calls for a ban on supertrawlers were made last year when the Lithuanian-registered Margiris – a 142-metre (465ft) boat with a deadweight of 6,200 tonnes, once considered the second largest in the world and banned from Australian waters – spent time off the south coast of England.According to analysis by Greenpeace, Margiris was fishing in an area of the Channel designated by the government as a marine conservation zone. However, the government said it was monitored closely and no infringements were found.The overall number of voyages in UK waters by supertrawlers each year is unclear. One ship, the Kirkella, based in Hull, can catch 2.3 million fish on every two-month voyage but it is far smaller than Margiris.Conservationists claim that anecdotal evidence suggests the ships wreak havoc on sea life.“It’s just been a long stream of dolphin deaths, I have never seen anything quite like it,” said John Hourston, from the Blue Planet Society. “We have had several storms but dolphins do not die because of weather, they are great swimmers.”He believes the evidence points to supertrawlers being responsible for an increase in stranded dolphins off the Sussex coast and the west of Ireland, but that scientific study is needed to incontrovertibly prove the link. “We have just got mass dolphin die-offs and mass fishing fleets and the two correlate, but we need more evidence.”At the very least, he said, these ships should fitted with CCTV cameras or have independent observers on board to monitor which fish are being caught.“I am not talking about the inshore fishermen, I am talking about the industrial supertrawler fleets,” he said. “We should not be allowing supertrawlers in British waters.”French campaigners have also highlighted how rising numbers of dead dolphins are being washed up on the coast of the Bay of Biscay after becoming caught up in large trawler nets. In 2017, researchers said the number of dead dolphins washing up on British and French shores was at its highest level in more than 14 years, echoing observations from Ireland. The website of fishing company Parlevliet \u0026amp Van der Plas, the owner of the Margiris, says it has an “excellent reputation for sustainable fishing”.It added: “Our catch quotas are dictated by government and EU regulations, and are based on scientific advice. We fish without causing damage to the seabed, and without disturbing the ecological system.”A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “As an independent coastal state, we will have the right to decide who fishes in our waters and on what terms.“This means we can design our own domestic fishing policy, one that supports our coastal communities and lets the UK lead the way on sustainable fishing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe5e4d762623ce5452b52de6008f936afc85098/0_49_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=1900\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7d77e063477ed1c8f12c818211fef996 3800w","title":"meera sodha vegan recipe polenta balsamic radicchio mushrooms","story":"A well-balanced dish of soft polenta, bitter leaves, sweet agave and tart balsamic all rounded out by earthy mushroomsRadicchio, in its many varieties and hues of pink, is nature’s most outrageous flirt.The castelfranco is big and blowsy, like a giant rose that’s almost too good to eat.

If you can’t find them, use red ene (chicory) instead, but because bitterness varies between the different breeds, so add the agave syrup to taste.1 litre vegetable stock180g instant polentaFine sea saltOlive oil, for cooking1 large head radicchio taro (around 500g), cut into 1cm shredsBalsamic vinegar2 tbsp agave syrup (or to taste)1 tbsp lemon juice12 sage leaves500g chestnut mushrooms, sliced4 garlic cloves, peeled and mincedExtra-virgin olive oil, to finishPut the stock in a saucepan for which you have a lid and bring it to a rolling boil. Pour in the polenta in a thin, steady stream, whisking as you do so, then keep whisking for another minute. The polenta will quickly thicken to a paste, and the moment it starts bubbling like molten lava, turn off the heat (if you let it bubble too much, it will get too thick). Stir in half a teaspoon of salt and cover the pan with the lid.Heat three tablespoons of oil in a wide frying pan and, once it’s hot, add the shredded radicchio. At first it will look like it will never wilt, but six minutes later, the radicchio will be soft and tender. Add two and a half tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, agave syrup to taste, lemon juice and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Cook for another two minutes, transfer the radicchio and all the pan juices to a bowl, then wipe out the pan.Line a small plate with a couple of pieces of kitchen paper(or a clean cloth). Heat three tablespoons of oil in the same pan over a medium-high heat and, when hot, add the sage leaves. Cook until the sage crisps up in the pan (around three minutes), then transfer with a slotted spoon to the paper-lined plate to drain. Add half the mushrooms and garlic to the hot oil, cook for about 10 minutes, until the mushrooms are bronzed, then tip into a bowl. Repeat with the remaining mushrooms and garlic. Return the first batch to the pan, then add a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt.Ahead of serving, stir the polenta to check the consistency – it should be like thick custard – if not, boil the kettle and add just enough hot water to loosen it. To serve, portion the polenta on to plates, flatten with the back of a spoon, then top first with some radicchio and then some mushrooms and crisp sage. Finish with a drizzle of your finest olive oil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/042fda317ed2bd9f2fdd5271efa7d5ab2814d40e/0_1995_5792_3474/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=598236bd23c68bd8f4c9210a8ed947a9","title":"rhubarb and custard portuguese tarts liam charles recipe","story":"A very British, seasonal rhubarb filling makes a cameo appearance in these Potuguese custard tartsI will always celebrate the combination of rhubarb and custard, whether it’s in a cake, crumble or even a chocolate. However, this year I’m expressing my love for this classic pairing through a Portuguese tart, with a cameo appearance from some ground almonds. It’s a real winner.You will need a 8.5cm round cutter, and a 12-hole muffin tin.400g rhubarb, topped and tailed100g golden caster sugarFor the pastry3 tsp ground cinnamonZest of 3 oranges1 x 500g block all-butter puff pastryFlour, for dustingButter, for greasingFor the custard8 egg yolks100g golden caster sugar 1 tbsp cornflour 250ml whole milk250ml double cream 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 tsp almond extractTo finish 80g ground almondsA knob of unsalted butter, melted (optional)Heat the oven to 160C (150C fan)gas 3. Put the rhubarb sticks in a baking tray, sprinkle over the caster sugar, then cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for a further seven minutes, until completely soft cut into 24 pieces.Combine the cinnamon and orange zest in a small bowl. Roll out the pastry a little on a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle over half the cinnamon mix, then roll again, pressing in the spice and zest until you have a rectangle measuring roughly 20cm x 50cm and about 5mm thick. Wrap and chill for 30 minutes. Turn the oven up to 200C (190C fan)gas 6½.Make the custard: put the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour in a bowl, and mix smooth. Put the milk and cream in a medium-sized pan, add the vanilla and almond extract, and warm over a low heat until just below boiling point. Pour the warm milk over the egg mixture, stirring quickly. Once fully incorporated, transfer to a jug.Remove the pastry from the fridge and stamp out 12 discs using an 8.5cm round cutter. Press them into a lightly greased 12-hole muffin tin, pushing the pastry into the base and up the sides to form a cup.Pour the custard into the pastry cases, leaving a 1cm gap at the top, then carefully put two pieces of rhubarb on each tart. Bake for 20–22 minutes, until set with a crisp pastry edge and a slightly caramelised custard.Leave to cool for five minutes in the tray, then pop out each tart and put on a wire rack. While the tarts are still slightly warm, roll the edge of each one in ground almonds, brushing with a little melted butter to help them stick, if needed.

It’s impossible to deny the differences between the continent’s various cuisines, true, but you also can’t ignore its common spirit, which here in Britain is evident wherever you look. We may have left the EU six weeks ago, but we are still proudly (and greedily) European.This may sound an unlikely combination, but nutty tahini brings rich creaminess to crisp schnitzel. The same treatment also works with pork chops, but adjust cooking times accordingly. Serve with a green salad or a more traditional potato salad, if you prefer.Prep 15 minCook 50 minServes 4 as a main2 shallots, peeled and sliced into very thin rounds (90g net weight) 1 tbsp lemon juiceSalt and black pepper2 large eggs80g good-quality tahini2 tbsp dijon mustard130g panko breadcrumbs50g sesame seeds50g plain flour4 large skinless chicken breasts (680g net weight)300ml sunflower oil, for fryingFor the dressing60g good-quality tahini2 tbsp lemon juice1½ tbsp dijon mustard1 garlic clovtahini e, peeled and crushed2-3 tbsp parsley leaves, finely choppedHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. Put the shallot, lemon juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a small bowl, toss to combine, then leave to soften while you make the rest of the dish. Whisk all the dressing ingredients in a small bowl with 50ml water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, until smooth.Whisk the eggs, tahini, mustard, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of water in a shallow container (or on a plate with a lip). In a separate container (or plate), mix the panko, sesame and a teaspoon of salt. Put the flour on a third plate.Lay the chicken breasts on a board and, using a meat mallet (or the base of a heavy saucepan), lightly bash them, until they are about 1½cm thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, then, one by one, coat the breasts in the flour and shake off any excess. Dredge them one by one in the egg mixture, then coat in the breadcrumb mixture. Put the oil in a saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, fry one chicken breast for about two minutes on each side, until golden, then transfer to a rack set on an oven tray (the rack ensures the bottom of the schnitzels won’t go soggy in the oven). Repeat with the remaining chicken, one breast at a time, then bake for seven minutes, or until cooked through.Cut each schnitzel widthways into 2cm-wide strips, then use the knife to transfer each breast neatly to a large platter. Scatter the shallots on top, drizzle on half the dressing and serve with the rest alongside.This German bread dumpling gets its name from the way it’s traditionally shaped and cooked in kitchen cloth (serviette). It’s like a savoury bread pudding and would make a great side for a Sunday roast with lots of gravy. Get ahead by cooking the dumpling the day before and leaving it to set in the fridge, ready to be sliced and fried the next day.1 large baguette, crust removed and cut into roughly 1½-2 cm cubes (340g net weight) 500ml whole milk 70g unsalted butter 3 large eggs3 onions, peeled and each sliced into 5 rounds (450g net)4 garlic cloves, peeled3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasingSalt and black pepper20g parsley leaves, roughly chopped20g chives, sliced into 1½cm lengths, plus 1 tbsp extra, finely chopped, to serve1 generous grating nutmeg1 lemon – zest grated, to get 1½ tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp 120g soured cream, to serve (optional)Heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Spread out the bread on an oven tray lined with baking paper and toast in the oven for eight minutes, to dry out but not colour. Leave to cool a little, then transfer to a large bowl.Put the milk and 50g butter in a medium saucepan on a medium heat and leave until the butter has melted and the milk is steaming. Whisk the eggs in a large, heatproof bowl, then very slowly pour in the hot milk, whisking continuously. Pour this over the bread cubes and leave to soak for 30 minutes, stirring every now and then – the bread will soften and absorb lots of liquid.Put a well-greased griddle pan on a high heat. In a bowl, gently toss the onion rounds and garlic with a tablespoon and a half of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Once the pan is hot, grill the onion rounds in two or three batches for about five minutes on each side, until well charred and softened. Remove the onions, then griddle the garlic for two to three minutes, until well charred. Finely chop all the garlic and half the onion, and add to the bread bowl with the herbs, nutmeg, lemon zest, a teaspoon of salt and lots of pepper.Cut out three pieces of foil roughly 40cm x 30cm in size, and cut out one piece of baking paper of similar size. Top the paper with the bread mixture and use the paper to roll and shape it into a roughly 22cm-long x 9cm-diameter cylinder. Wrap in a piece of foil, twisting the ends to seal it tightly, then repeat twice more with the remaining foil sheets, so the parcel is as compact as possible.Fill a large, 28cm, cast-iron saucepan for which you have a lid with water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium, then lay in the dumpling cylinder seam side up – it won’t be completely submerged. Cover the pan with the lid and leave to cook for an hour.Use tongs to lift the dumpling from the pan and, when it’s cool enough to handle, gently unwrap the foil and paper. Leave to set for 30 minutes, or longer, if time allows (the longer it’s left, the easier it will be to slice), then use a serrated knife to cut it into 2cm-thick slices – you should end up with 10.Melt 10g butter and half a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on medium-high heat. Once hot, sear a third of the dumpling slices for two minutes a side, or until nicely browned. Repeat with the remaining slices, using up the last of the butter and oil as you go.Gently toss the reserved grilled onion with the lemon juice, extra chives and a pinch of salt, and put on a large platter. Arrange the dumpling slices alongside and serve with soured cream, if using.This makes more crumble than you need: save the excess for sprinkling on yoghurt or ice-cream. All the dish’s different components can be made up to a day ahead. And if you really want to save time, used just crushed Biscoffs instead of making the crumble.2 x 410g tins sliced peaches in juice, drained (500g net)1 lemon – zest finely grated, to get 1 tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp 1 tbsp caster sugar1 tbsp thyme leavesFor the custard700ml whole milk100g piece fresh ginger, skin-on and thinly sliced1 vanilla pod, split in half lengthways and seeds scraped out5 large egg yolks55g caster sugarFor the crumble50g plain flour45g unsalted butter, fridge-cold, and cut into 1½ cm cubes30g caster sugar½ tsp ground cinnamon40g Lotus Biscoff biscuits, blitzed or crushed by hand into a coarse crumble1 pinch flaked sea saltFirst make the custard. Put the milk, ginger and vanilla pod and seeds in a medium saucepan for which you have a lid. Bring to a gentle simmer on a medium heat, pressing down on the solids to extract as much flavour as possible, then turn off the heat, cover and leave to infuse for at least an hour (if you’re getting ahead, now refrigerate overnight). Strain into a second pan, discard the solids and bring back to a simmer on a medium heat.Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl until smooth. Pour in the warm milk in a slow, steady stream, whisking, until everything is combined and the bowl is warm to the touch. Pour the lot back into the pan, put on a medium heat and cook, stirring continuously, for about 15 minutes, until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Strain through a sieve into a large bowl, cover the surface of the custard with clingfilm and refrigerate until ready to use (you want it fridge-cold).In a bowl, mix the peaches, lemon zest and juice, and sugar, and refrigerate (again, so it’s fridge-cold).Heat the oven to 170C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. For the crumble, put the flour in a large bowl and, with your fingers, rub in the butter until the mix resembles coarse crumbs. Add the sugar, cinnamon, crushed biscuits and flaked salt, toss to mix, then spread out on a medium oven tray lined with baking paper. Bake for 18 minutes, stirring once halfway, or until nicely browned, then set aside to cool and crisp up further.Divide the custard between four shallow glass bowls. Top with the peaches and their liquid, followed by a generous spoonful of crumble and some thyme leaves. Serve with extra crumble in a bowl on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d5488ee267a75977834fc47bb8e9b8684f41af/64_61_2562_1537/master/2562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=880ec73dff350155340825aa353e8dd7","title":"liverpool v bournemouth premier league live","story":"46 min: Gomez slips a pass down the right for Oxlade-Chamberlain, who wins a corner off Ake. Alexander-Arnold to take.Liverpool get the second half underway. They’re kicking towards the Kop.Half-time entertainment: Meanwhile, across the city ...Another good 45 minutes for Jordan Henderson.45 min +3: Gomez tries to release Salah down the right. Blooter! Overhit! Out of play. Goal kick.45 min +2: Fraser works hard down the left to win a corner off Alexander-Arnold. Stanislas takes. Milner slaps it clear. Both teams are pushing for a goal that would significantly change the picture at half-time.45 min +1: The first of four added minutes. Stacey nearly gifts Mane possession in the Bournemouth box, but just about gets away with it.45 min: Smith barges Salah off the ball down the left, and slips a pass upfield for Wilson. Adrian races out of his area to punt clear, just in time. On the touchline, Klopp is ranting and raving. You’d pay cash money to be a fly on the wall in the Liverpool dressing room during the break.43 min: Fraser dinks a ball down the left to release Stanislas. Milner does well to track his run, ensuring he can’t slip Wilson in down the middle. Stanislas lays off to Fraser, who dinks into the box for Billing, but Gomez is on hand to clear. Bournemouth are still carrying a threat. Liverpool don’t look secure at the back at all. Lots of space.41 min: Mane is penalised for being kicked by Lerma. The referee is currently doing a splendid job of riling up both sets of players.39 min: Stanislas makes good down the inside left and pearls a shot towards the bottom left. Adrian parries, although not in a particularly confident style. The ball spins out for a corner, which Adrian clears with a much more definitive punch. Liverpool attempt to break upfield, but make a Horlicks of the three-on-two.38 min: More ill feeling, as Gomez nudges Smith off the field and into the advertising hoardings. Smith whacks his noggin. He’s up soon enough, rubbing his head and moaning at the referee. Speaking of Gomez ... “If Gomez goes down from the initial push the ref would probably blow for a foul before it got any further,” argues Dan C. “Maybe not a ‘clear and obvious error’ for VAR to overturn, but it doesn’t encourage honesty either. Which would we rather see?”37 min: Salah, dropping deep on the right, rakes a diagonal looper towards Milner, coming in from the left. Milner connects, but volleys softly into the arms of Ramsdale. Bournemouth are holding on a bit.35 min: Mane loses the flight of a long ball and sticks up an arm as it sails towards the stand. He’s still in play, though. Lerma and Fraser want him booked, and tell the referee so. The referee isn’t minded to flourish a yellow. The crowd aren’t too happy with Bournemouth’s demands. There’s a bit of an edge to this now, for one reason and another.34 min: Klopp celebrated that goal with a wild scream, and a pointed holler in the ear of the linesman, who happened to be passing. He’s clearly still livid about that opening goal.Van Dijk intercepts as Bournemouth consider a quick break. He rolls a straight ball down the middle for Mane, who is in acres. Mane advances towards the box, draws Ramsdale, and slips the ball past the keeper and into the bottom right. Easy as that.31 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain has a dig from 25 yards. It pinballs around the Bournemouth box before the visitors clear. Liverpool are beginning to dominate.29 min: Another corner for Liverpool ... but this one is whizzed straight out of play by Alexander-Arnold. Bournemouth are getting pushed back again, their early verve suddenly lost.28 min: This is much better from Simpson! Van Dijk floats a left-to-right diagonal for Alexander-Arnold, who fires across the face of goal. Mane is waiting to tap in, but Simpson somehow hooks behind for a corner, from which nothing occurs. That makes up for his earlier error ... a bit.27 min: Salah dug Mane out of a hole there. That move looked like falling apart, a superb chance about to be squandered, but Salah ensured it would count with a magnificent finish from the edge of the box. Mane will get an assist for that, but really.Anfield is making some noise now! Mane robs Simpson, who was ambling out from the back, yet to get up to speed. Liverpool are two on one! Mane thinks about shooting, but rolls the ball to Salah on his right. It’s a dreadful pass, behind the man, but Salah checks, shifts inside, and threads a shot into the bottom right.23 min: You could hear a pin drop at the minute. In the dugout, Klopp tries to whip up his charges. It’s all extremely flat. Penny for Pep Guardiola’s thoughts at the moment.21 min: Liverpool win their first corner. Alexander-Arnold takes it from the right. Play is stopped as Wijnaldum takes an accidental whack from Ake’s flailing arm. Anfield wants a penalty, but there was no intent. Mind you, elsewhere, Lerma shoved Fabinho to the floor, so perhaps everyone was claiming for that. Either way, Liverpool are getting nowt, and the hosts look extremely agitated.19 min: Simpson comes on for the Bournemouth captain Steve Cook. “I assume we can stop talking about VAR favouring Liverpool now, right?” asks Oliver Loksa. BT Sport refereeing guru Peter Walton certainly thinks it should have been a foul, as the “clear and obvious” bar is lowered significantly for an “upper body foul”. And he usually just parrots the official line, so make of that what you will.17 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain plays a cute ball down the inside-right channel. Steve Cook stretches but can’t intercept. Firmino has space to shoot, but his effort is parried by Ramsdale. Bournemouth clear ... but it looks like Cook has done his hamstring.16 min: Lewis Cook plays a ball down the inside-left channel for Wilson, who beats the offside trap and zips upfield. Liverpool are again short at the back, and lucky that Wilson’s pass forward for Stanislas is too strong. Adrian claims.14 min: Milner is forced to concede a corner out on the right. Fraser takes. Ake pearls a glorious header goalwards. Liverpool are fortunate that it’s straight at Adrian, who can tip over the bar. The second corner comes to nothing, but you can be sure most of the punters inside Anfield are currently thinking about Devon Loch.13 min: Let’s see if James Milner’s pre-match team-talk had any effect. There’s no immediate sign, as Fraser crosses from the right. The ball only just flies over the head of Stanislas in the middle.11 min: Liverpool have only themselves to blame for that one. Wilson did shove Gomez in the back, and off the ball, but everyone in red then stopped. Bournemouth played to the whistle, and VAR official Michael Oliver saw nothing wrong with Wilson’s challenge. Anfield falls silent, bar a few boos, and a cheer in the away end. On the touchline, Klopp throws his hands around, urging the crowd to get going.Billing takes up possession, feeding Lerma down the right. He rolls the ball across the face of goal for Wilson, who taps home. VAR checks, decides there’s no shove on Gomez, and Liverpool are trailing again!8 min: Wilson barges Gomez out of the way as the pair chase a long ball. It looks like a foul, but ...6 min: Bournemouth are sitting deep. Liverpool hogging possession. It already looks like being one of those games. Can the title hopefuls break through? Can the relegation strugglers hold out? Alexander-Arnold crosses for Salah. Steve Cook heads behind for a corner, but the flag goes up, correctly, for offside.4 min: It’s a lovely late-winter, early-spring day at Anfield. Not much in the way of breeze. Liverpool stroke it around the back in a similarly mild style. Then suddenly there’s a little space for Alexander-Arnold down the right, but his cross is easily hoicked clear by Ake.2 min: Otherwise, it’s a slow start, and Anfield has quickly fallen silent. Expect this to be a tense affair, unless Liverpool score early.40 secs: A mazy dribble by Oxlade-Chamberlain down the right. The ball’s slipped inside for Van Dijk, who lumps forward and nearly releases Salah down the right. Ramsdale is out quickly to claim. An early statement of intent from the hosts.Bournemouth get the ball rolling. They’ll be kicking towards the Kop in this first half.The teams are out! Liverpool are four wins from the title, and the atmosphere at Anfield is accordingly hot. A huge roar as the players take to the field of play. Much amusement as the players meet, the hosts trooping along the line offering no handshakes, as per the coronavirus edict. Smiles all round at the oddity. Let’s balance out the fun with some pre-match misery, courtesy of Ian Copestake: “Despite defending Lovren far better than Lovren actually can himself, Juergen has not included him on the bench. Kudos to the Croatian for self-isolating. I am going to say this out loud, but I think this will not be a win for Liverpool. I’m no psychologist but until they get the game with Madrid-lite done and won then and only then will the burden they seem to be playing under will be lifted.”BT Sport have been lugging into Liverpool stand-in captain James Milner’s pre-match pep talk. Here’s what he told the rest of the team as they were warming up. “Those reactions, straight away, as soon as we lose it, bodies round it, then we play all that area, eh? Doesn’t matter who scores, we score, they score, we lift it again. Every kick-off is a trigger for us.” Well that’s fate tempted. Goalless draw ahoy!Jurgen’s version. “The results in the last four games were not exactly how we wanted them to be. So we have the chance to change the situation. Bournemouth have to fight for the league, so we have to fight, make it as difficult as possible, and get a result. In football you always have to find a solution.” Is Robertson rested or injured, BT Sport’s Des Kelly asks. A long pause, before a considered response. “Something in between?! He would have started today but he felt slightly bad, so he will be good, fine for Wednesday, but not today.”Cherries boss Eddie Howe throws down the gauntlet. “It’s the ultimate test and that’s how we have to look at this game and approach it. It’s a great opportunity to show how good we are. You learn from every opponent’s gameplan and see if there’s anything that can help your team, but we are us. We are our unique team with the strengths that we possess, and I think we can cause them problems. We have to believe we can get a positive result today. Being in the bottom three should focus our energies in a positive way. We know we have to do something. The onus is on us.”BREAKING NEWS: Liverpool will be playing in red ...... while Bournemouth will sport robustly couriered second-choice blue.Liverpool make three changes to the team that went down so spectacularly at Watford last week. Adrian in for Alisson Joe Gomez for Dejan Lovren James Milner for Andy Robertson.Bournemouth make one change from last weekend’s draw with Chelsea. Junior Stanislas replaces the injured Josh King.Winning the league isn’t meant to be easy. Liverpool supporters are all too aware of this, into the 30th year of the search for their holy grail. Mind you, this time last week, it felt like the Reds were leading a procession, four wins from their first English championship since 1990. But one no-show against Watford later, plus a KO in the cup, and the mood-o-meter has switched from Party to Pensive. If they fail to beat Bournemouth this lunchtime, it won’t exactly be crisis time ... not yet ... but a few nerve-ends will start to jangle, twitch and yip, you can be darn sure of that.As Liverpool have just found out, a lot can change in a couple of matches. But then spin it another way: if they see off relegation-haunted Bournemouth today, as they surely should, then pull off a recovery in the Champions League against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, the entire picture will suddenly look a hell of a lot brighter. It doesn’t take much for the dial to shift either way. And what better opponent to shake off the post-break blues against than Bournemouth? Liverpool have won their last five games against Eddie Howe’s side to the aggregate tune of 17-0. They quite literally couldn’t Cherry-pick a better fixture in which to bounce back.And yet Bournemouth won’t be without hope. They haven’t won in three, but came mighty close to beating Chelsea last weekend. They’ve also claimed a couple of big scalps this season: Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Manchester United at home. And they earned a 2-2 draw at Anfield back in April 2017, the same season they turned Klopp’s side over at Dean Court, coming from behind for a famous smash-and-grab 4-3 victory. It’s not totally been a one-sided relationship. Plus the fact Anfield may get a little nervous if things don’t go to plan for the home heroes in the early exchanges.This could be the match that steadies the champions-elect after a brief, uncharacteristic wobble. Or it could go some way to saving Bournemouth’s Premier League skin, while planting more seeds of doubt in Liverpool’s collective mind, with big away games at Everton and Manchester City coming up. Plenty riding on this, then, and it’s going to be fun finding out how it all comes down. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51b2ab3f71707c8c727bb366d08cf89ff40a099b/0_30_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2783e8893149b05e3974493bdb763a2e","title":"alys fowler how to breed perfect pumpkin","story":"If you can grow pumpkins, you can breed them, says the Austrian who is creating the heirloom varieties of the futureKlaus Brugger loves pumpkins. In particular, he loves a certain flesh quality and the nutty flavour in winter squash, and because he is a curious type and a passionate gardener, the Austrian wondered whether he might be able to make his perfect pumpkin. I know this because his Instagram account (@klaus_brugger), which is full of pumpkin pinups, is documenting this journey. It’s a brilliant educational tour of how to go about creating your own vegetable varieties on a small scale.In his late teens, Brugger came across Carol Deppe’s influential book Breed Your Own Vegetable Varieties and finally got it: “If you want a variety with certain characteristics that are not available, you have to do it!” He is not alone in wanting his own pumpkin he’s part of a growing band of independent breeders creating the flavours of the future. Plant breeding can be complicated and scientific, using gene-splicing and the like but there’s a simpler side that’s been going on for as long as we’ve been gardening. If you can grow a pumpkin, you can breed one: take two pumpkin varieties that you like and cross-pollinate the flowers by hand, then isolate the flowers from further pollination, grow the pumpkins to maturity and collect the seed. The next year, sow that seed and select the pumpkins that represent the traits you are looking for. Then stabilise the population, by further selecting and often back-crossing, until you have a pure-bred pumpkin.In the UK, Kate McEvoy and Ben Gabel at Real Seeds have set up the Breed Your Own Squash project. For £2.39, you get 12 seeds and a chance to create your own vegetable. Many heirloom varieties were bred by ordinary folk, our great-grandparents, saving seeds. We need ersity in our vegetable gene pool because no one knows what a future climate will be like. “I like to think in my backyard are the heirloom varieties of coming generations,” Brugger says.

Luca could do his times tables in reception. Nathan had a book deal by eight. Meet the child prodigiesJeeva was British Mensa’s youngest member when she joined just after her third birthday. (Muhammad Haryz Nadzim, three, from Durham, beat her record earlier this year.) But Jeeva began impressing her parents when she was still a baby. At seven months, she started sounding out words like “cat” and “grandma” at 11 months, she finished bedtime stories, sometimes from memory, sometimes by recognising words and by 15 months was reading independently. Now, with an IQ of 160+ (the same range as Einstein and Stephen Hawking), she devours books like the Isadora Moon series, aimed at five- to eight-year-olds, or Enid Blyton’s The Magic Faraway Tree, reading in her head for up to an hour at a time, when most children her age are learning phonics.Her mother Malveen, is a dentist, and her father Hardeep, is an actuary. Both 32, they are high-achievers: Malveen has always been academic, gaining 10 A*s at GCSE and now studying for a postgraduate degree in orthodontics Hardeep gained a postgraduate distinction in actuarial science and is now studying wealth management. Jeeva also has an older cousin in Mensa.“Malveen has often called her a little Matilda,” says Hardeep, of the book-loving bright spark imagined by Roald Dahl. Jeeva, who has the comprehension and mathematical ability of a child twice her age, says: “I like reading and learning about things in the world and how they work.”She is chatty and sociable despite the fact that, for most of her babyhood she was the only child in her year group who could talk. “I wished they could, because then I could have lots more friends,” she says.Teachers at her private preschool (including Mrs Smart and Mrs Brain, their real names “It’s like a Mr Men book,” Jeeva is quick to point out) invite her to read to classmates. “No one else can read the words that I’m saying,” she says. She goes to gymnastics, and is learning chess and coding. She also has high emotional intelligence and describes feelings in depth. A simple question about her day can trigger lengthy conversations about outer space or how blood pumps around the body. Her parents limit screen time to once a week, during which she has watched the animated film Cars 2 and set her sights on becoming a racing driver, she tells me.Malveen remembers how she used to turn toys upside down to look at the workings: “We decided early on to ignore the age range on games – these immediately put limits on a child.” But when we discuss her intelligence, her parents are quick to remind her that she is kind, too. “We don’t want her to only be in one box: clever,” Malveen says. “My main thing is that she feels happy and fulfilled, because that isn’t always the case when chasing perfection. We model failure for her, making mistakes in front of her. We ask each day what her successes were, and what she failed at, and celebrate both.”“Most of all she loves to talk to us,” Hardeep says. “She’s always trying to crack a joke and is very playful. She’s just a child who needs to enjoy being a child.”“When I was six years old, my mum asked me what I wanted for Christmas,” Nathan says. “I asked for a book about how to be your best self. We searched online, and on bookshop and library shelves, but it didn’t exist. So the opportunity to write it myself was born.” He finished the book two days before his eighth birthday, recruiting Paralympic archer Danielle Brown as co-author after hearing her speak at a Mensa event. “We went to the book fair together,” Nathan says. “I told publishers the backstory and they said yes right there and then. I was very proud.”Nathan is plucky, eloquent – and more painstakingly polite than any adult I have met. “I’ve always been interested in self-development,” he says. “I want to spread that message to all children. Everyone I meet says this is rare for a child, but it comes naturally to me. I’m full of confidence and gratitude for my opportunities.”The book was published in the UK last year and launches in the US this month Nathan hopes motivational speaking bookings will follow. “I hope I get to fly all over the world,” he says. “That’s my dream – to travel and learn about different cultures. I want to go to Disneyland, and I’d like to stay with indigenous tribes to learn about plants and medicines.”Nathan now plays the piano at grade five standard his favourite composers are Bach and Beethoven. He is in a swimming team and a European title-holder in Brazilian jiu-jitsu (“I love the discipline and ethos,” he says. “It’s quite tactical, like 3D chess”). He also practises yoga and meditation: “It’s all about harmony and balance, to ground yourself after a busy day.” He watches TV only occasionally, usually David Attenborough documentaries, and is a “huge bookworm”, preferring books on geology, world history or motivational titles.Two years ago, Nathan’s father moved out of the family home, leaving him, his mother and two younger siblings, Simeon, eight, who is also in Mensa, and Oriana, three. Nathan says: “I think having a high IQ made it harder when my dad left,” he says. “I felt I should be able to understand, but I just can’t. We all have a story.”All three children are home-schooled. Their mother, Anna, 40, a lawyer and psychotherapist, says she was known as “the brains of the family” as a child, but frequently felt misunderstood. She didn’t start Nathan in mainstream education, but he attended for a year aged six, when she was unwell. His unhappiness led the family to visit an educational psychologist, who revealed the extent of Nathan’s intellect. Soon after that, Anna took him out of school again.“One school teacher nicknamed him ‘glum Nathan’,” Anna claims. “He hated every moment. The minute you mention intelligence, there’s a stigma a perception of silver-spoon upper-class kids on their way to Oxbridge, and a bragging, pushy parent. Gifted children can have barriers to break through and come from every background and life circumstance.”Nathan says: “I tried school, but no one understood my jokes or really got me. Everyone’s different. I try not to sweat the small stuff. I’ve got better friends now that I follow my passions instead of the crowd. I can discuss physics or marine biology with them, and they don’t make me feel weird.” He reels off a huge list of academic interests: Latin and classical studies Mandarin and Chinese Spanish, nutrition, debating, Stem subjects and psychology. He is working on his second book, too. “But I’m keeping the details a bit hush-hush,” he says. He thinks clever children are often misunderstood. “We’re more than brains on legs. We have hearts and souls, dreams and feelings, too.”Abbey lists her interests as architecture, space exploration, inventing and home science experiments, and is hoping for a place at grammar school next year. Her IQ of 144 was not tested until a year ago, when teachers called her parents into school, expressing concerns that she was depressed. Five minutes into an appointment with a private psychologist, her parents, account manager Belinda, 43, and Duncan, 45, a director of an IT company, were told: “This child is not depressed, she’s a genius.”Abbey is creative and methodical. At 18 months, she cut perfect circles with scissors aged two, she described a seven-mile car journey to her parents using simple directions (“go there, turn here”) because she wanted to visit a cafe, but didn’t know its name. At six, she would craft intricate fishermen and animals from tinfoil.While Abbey enjoys playing with her younger sisters, Cameron and Erin, she has not celebrated a birthday with friends since she was six, and has already moved schools once since emigrating from South Africa to the UK last year. “I see that I’m a bit different, but in a good way,” Abbey says. “If someone tells me I’m really clever, it makes me happy and proud, but kids can be mean. At break time, I like to talk about science and things, but the others like to play. Once they agreed to talk about maths with me, then ran away. That made me feel really sad.”Abbey is dyslexic and more comfortable in the company of adults, but has found like-minded friends through Mensa. “It’s easier to be with clever kids, because you can talk about stuff you like doing,” she says. “I usually finish my schoolwork so quickly that I have to do extra worksheets, fetch stuff from the printer or help others with their work.“In year one, the maths was really easy. I told my mum and she spoke to the teachers to ask for something harder, which she still does,” Abbey says. “I’m in a higher maths class than my friends. They finish their work as quickly as they can, but I want to stay in class longer. It’s fun and challenging when you’ve not seen something before and you get it for the first time.“At home, I love baking and cooking. My dad lets me cook dinner with him. I like reading animal encyclopaedias and trying experiments. I know, for example, that octopuses have three hearts – but what do they do with them? I watch TV, but mostly enjoy art and teaching my puppy, Simba, tricks.”Abbey shows me her sketch book, containing silhouettes of a boat and a page of perfectly spherical doughnuts, shaded with coloured pencil. In South Africa, she was spotted as a “future talent” by a Johannesburg art dealer, and has won competitions here, too. “I sold some of my art to the psychologist who did my assessment and asked for a microscope instead of payment,” Abbey says. “I won a hotel talent competition when I was little with a one-minute drawing of a unicorn.” This facility with art and science is not unusual among children with high IQs. Educator and psychologist Lyn Kendall, Mensa’s gifted-child consultant, explains: “Research shows that the majority of exceptionally able children are good all-rounders due to their highly competitive and driven natures. When they are younger, art may not be a strong point for them, but once their coordination develops, it becomes something else to excel at.”Abbey hopes to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, but her ambitions do not end there. “I’d like to go into space or build a hover car that flies over water and mountains,” she says.By the time Zayan was two, he could count to 100. Today he is in year two, but is given year five work. “Maths is my best lesson because it’s really easy,” he says. “My favourite part is doing ides in my head. In maths, my best friend does easy sheets. I do fractions and multiplications.” He enjoys other lessons, too. Excitedly, he says: “We’re learning about dreams and goals right now. Mine is to become an engineer. I would make stuff, like a Lego drill that can drill for metal.” He runs to get his favourite Lego creation: a 1,167-piece, VW Beetle for ages 16+. He is learning the ukulele and recorder, and enjoys using music apps. “I’ve got something where I can make any beats I want.” His mother and father, Sameela and Adeel, both 29, run a footwear business and were young parents. They are graduates, but wouldn’t describe themselves as being above average intelligence, and have found Zayan’s ability overwhelming. By three, he could count in four languages – Arabic, Urdu, English and Spanish – and knew the English and Arabic alphabets. “He’d hear something in Arabic once or twice at his grandparents’ and pick it up,” Sameela says. “He brought home a picture book from kindergarten and asked, ‘What kind of book is this, there are no words?’ He had a huge interest in numbers, and little quirks, too. He didn’t like foods touching on his plate, and would never get muddy.”It was only when his brother Raafi, four, arrived that his parents realised Zayan was different. Raafi hit milestones in line with most children and long after his brother had they were able to compare the boys’ behaviour, too. As well as an inquisitive mind, Zayan had the heightened emotions common in gifted children. At nursery, he experienced separation anxiety and would cry until he was sick. When Zayan was five, a psychologist confirmed an IQ of 150, the mathematical comprehension of a nine-year-old and the reading age of a 10-year-old.“At first I didn’t think he was gifted,” Sameela says. “I just needed help. I struggled with how to occupy him or answer his questions.” She sometimes feels obliged to play down his intelligence: “People stare or listen once they hear him speak. They ask what I do to make him so smart. When I say I don’t do anything, I often get a shocked face, as though I’m lying. The only thing we push him to do is to work on his confidence.”Now Zayan attends private school – a choice the family might not have made if he wasn’t so bright – but still struggles emotionally. “He’s never just gone somewhere and started playing,” Sameela says. “He stands back and analyses. His best friends are girls because they’re less boisterous. He feels safe with them, but has huge meltdowns. If they don’t need a boy for their princess game, he gets really upset, really quickly. Emotions are extreme. I book lots of clubs for him at lunchtime so he doesn’t have to deal with playtime.”In Zayan’s bedroom, his shelf is stacked with Roald Dahl and Horrid Henry collections he’s read them all. He shows me his newest invention – a “rocking rover” vehicle – and his toy drone. “I love flying my drone or paper planes,” he says. Today is Tuesday, which is homework day. “I’m glad when that’s out of the way. The worst thing about school is comprehension, and going up the tiring stairs. But the best thing is having a long lunchtime. And maths.”Luca was found to have an IQ of 158 when his academy tested its brightest year eight pupils – a recent offer to schools that Mensa credits with bringing in more young members. “They’d give a complicated word and ask for a synonym,” he remembers. “I’m not saying it was easy, but I just worked through.” He describes himself as a “human calculator”, and is now doing GCSE-level maths.“I like studying variables and I’d love to use my maths inside Nasa,” he says. “People think of astronauts, but I want to understand how rockets are programmed and engineered.” Chatting at home after school, Luca is initially reserved, but talks with enthusiasm about studying. “I love having my mind challenged,” he says. “I knew my times tables in reception. By year two, I was doing year six multiplication and long ision. I was years ahead, so they would give me algebra. I knew I was bright. We had maths puzzles at home and mum would turn everything into a game. She filled our house with books.”Luca lives with his mother Patrizia, 42, an immigration officer, father Mark, 45, a transport worker, and younger brother Simone, seven. Patrizia was also a bright child, but did not have the opportunities or encouragement to pursue her love of learning. “I didn’t realise the importance of it,” she says. “As a mum, I try to support him practically and emotionally. I make sure there are books to feed his appetite for knowledge, and explain why children can be cruel, because they don’t understand the importance of certain things or have the right values. Our greatest wish is that our child fulfils his dreams. Being in Mensa is opening a lot of doors.”That doesn’t necessarily mean job opportunities – Mensa’s consultant Lyn Kendall says that some members don’t put Mensa on their CVs as it can make employers wary. But it is a place to network: the organisation hosts social events for youngsters, has junior newsletters and web forums. Kendall also runs a Facebook group for parents. She says many don’t realise how gifted their children are until they begin education and socialising while they fit in in their own, often intelligent, households, others notice their precociousness and impose identities on them. “The minute they go out into the world, they get people saying, ‘Aren’t you clever?’ at the time when they’re building an identity. They often don’t know how to fail or how to study. A lot of them refuse school or drop out of university because of their fear of failure. Unless you’re very careful, they can grow up to be very fragile people.”Still, Luca says his maturity has left him feeling lonely. “No one likes a know-it-all,” he says. “Mum and dad have told me that being intelligent has negatives now, but will have positives when I do jobs that bring me happiness.”Luca enjoys computer games and watching fantasy and action films, like Men In Black. “I’m always looking below the surface, wondering how creators came up with those characters.” At weekends, he hangs out with his younger brother and parents, or does extra maths papers. He has “a couple of friends”, but rarely goes on playdates and is happiest taking tests. “When I’ve done well, I’ve made myself and my family proud,” he says.1,991 Members of Mensa, the high IQ society, who are under 1710½ Age at which children can sit the adult intelligence test, comprising verbal and non-verbal reasoning papers£250+ Cost of Mensa assessment with a private psychologist for younger children, using puzzles and games• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea97687745a051e42eb7ca98446d475c5d38fedb/0_52_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3005d358d8dc0b75d2ea1504e1a6ffd5","title":"swedish graphics italian tiling rome flat","story":"Designer Liselotte Watkins raided flea markets across Europe to create a colourful jumbleWhen Liselotte Watkins moved with her family to Rome from Milan four years ago, it was in such a rush that she had time to look at only one apartment. The previous owner had lived there for 30 years, and wouldn’t let her take photographs, so “my husband, Jonas, had to take my word for it,” she says. It was painted dark colours and the layout wasn’t practical, but it was close to Jonas’s new job, a decent school for their children Wim, 10, and Ava, eight, and Villa Borghese park. Swedish-born Watkins, an artist, illustrator and designer who has collaborated with Prada, Marimekko, and the Italian porcelain company Bitossi, works from a studio at home.“It’s not your classic, elegant Rome apartment: the kitchen is small, the heating and water come and go, and there’s no storage. But it does have big windows, which can be hard to find here, and some lovely original flooring,” she says. “Though it turns into a greenhouse in summer.”Like most Romans, the family rent. But they were allowed to paint the flat white, and redo the kitchen and bathroom floors. Today, it’s a bright, colourful three-bedroom home, filled with vintage furniture and Watkins’ own pieces. Scandinavian and Italian design sensibilities clash happily: in the hallway, an original patterned tiled floor sits alongside a pair of graphic Marimekko curtains.Watkins moved to Dallas, Texas when she was 17 to study. There followed a spell in New York, followed by six years in Stockholm, before she moved to Paris, which is where she met Jonas. So where is home?“We lived in Milan for 12 years before moving here, so I do feel quite Italian now,” she says. “The kids were born here, and are extremely Italian. But the longer you stay away, the more romantic your idea of ‘home’ becomes. I miss the stillness of Sweden, the forests, the architecture. But it’s a tough climate, and it shows in the people – it took years for the lady in my local supermarket in Stockholm to say hello to me. Here, the weather allows people to be more open, more joyous. But I’ll never fit in completely. I’m always a bit on the outside.”Wherever she lives, Watkins loves picking up one-off finds, and the apartment is full of them: a retro Ikea sideboard, posters, oil paintings, a Thonet sofa, a bench and a steel cabinet, all from flea markets across Europe. “I am a collector, but there’s no intention behind it. Usually, I’ve no idea what things are, I just find cheap stuff I like.” This includes a pair of Eames chairs left out on the street on New York’s Upper East Side in the 1990s – sadly, no longer the fertile hunting ground it was. “People have wised up to the value of vintage now,” she says. The odd contemporary piece comes from Jonas. “He loves smart furniture – I bring the junk. It’s a reflection of who we are,” she smiles.Last autumn, Watkins collaborated with Swedish design company Svenskt Tenn on her first interiors collection – a series of colourful graphic vases, cushions, lamps, a tray, and a wall textile. She named it Via Sallustiana, after her address in Rome. It was a long-awaited dream to work with the company, which is still best known for its iconic textiles by Josef Frank from the 1930s onwards. “I just kept on asking, until finally, when I had a show at my gallery in Stockholm, they asked me,” she says.Since then she has worked with the British company, Established \u0026amp Sons, on a collection of four vases. “I like these small collaborations, where the focus is on craftsmanship,” she says. “And I like the fact that what I’m doing is both art and design – I’ve realised you don’t have to choose.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de73a78294eb3da92a6931c2aea32787400e66e5/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a57ef7dc331d0faae31f2b292e0c842","title":"tell us are money struggles making you lonely","story":"We want to find out how people are feeling isolated by their financial woesWe may be bad at talking about money but we are arguably even worse at talking about our difficulties managing it.Research by the Money Advice Service found that half of people in debt did not want to talk to friends and family about it because they didn’t want to worry them.Money struggles can lead to people feeling cut off from others for a range of reasons, but withdrawing into financial loneliness can make it even harder to solve your problems.We want to understand more about how people feel isolated as a result of their financial woes.How has your employment status affected your income?

These are three foreign words a British audience is guaranteed to understand. This imperative of the French Revolution was emblazoned in large letters on the Royal Opera House’s safety curtain at the start of Beethoven’s only opera, Fidelio, in a new staging by the German director Tobias Kratzer. Since the cameras were on us, the main drape transformed into a video screen on which we could see ourselves taking our seats, we knew we were implicated.Many had flown in specially to hear the German superstar tenor Jonas Kaufmann singing the role of Florestan, who doesn’t appear until Act 2. This was the year’s hottest ticket for an opera that is not an automatic sell-out. Kaufmann has unique allure even when he is under the weather. An announcement was made, indulgence asked. He still sang formidably, unleashing his opening line with typically magnificent control, though he looked utterly miserable when he took his final bow. In contrast, singing the title role, the young Norwegian soprano Lise Davidsen smiled winningly at the outburst of cheers that greeted her.Conducted with restless intensity by the Royal Opera’s music director, Antonio Pappano, the orchestra on bristling form, this keenly anticipated staging was Kratzer’s Covent Garden debut. I didn’t see his Wagner production at the Bayreuth festival last year, though one newspaper headline suggests what I missed: “Tannhäuser mit Clown und Drag Queen”. Nor will Kratzer’s Fidelio please all. With additional dialogue concocted by the director from various sources, this production featured live video of a woman eating chocolate, and the brief appearance of a glossy horse called Tys. It was booed (production, not horse) by a noisy few at the curtain call of the opening matinee. Yes, there were irritations, but the interpolations often deepened the possible meanings of this jagged and never comfortable masterpiece.The two acts of Fidelio differ radically from each other. Kratzer and his designer, Rainer Sellmaier, have run with this notion: not merely a game of two halves but unmatched halves of two entirely different sports. The prison setting of Act 1 will reassure traditionalists. A French tricolour hangs over the gateway. Frock coats, tricorns, breeches, all confirm the story’s Reign of Terror context. The opera’s plot is straightforward, even if the background details remain obscure: Leonore, dressed as a man and called Fidelio, wants to free her husband, Florestan, a political prisoner, held in a dungeon cell. To do so, she takes a job at the prison and wins the trust of the jailer, Rocco (Georg Zeppenfeld).But what’s this? We know Marzelline (Amanda Forsythe), the jailer’s daughter, has fallen for this stranger and lost interest in her boyfriend, Jaquino (Robin Tristschler). Normally confined to emptying the laundry basket, here Marzelline tries to pull Fidelio’s trousers off. Logically enough, she soon realises Fidelio is a woman, usually only revealed at the end. It’s an intriguing twist, which humanises Marzelline and fills out a flimsy storyline. There’s another side to her in this production, involving a trumpet and a pistol, which, despite the feminist instinct and Forsythe’s sympathetic performance, backfires. The villainous Pizarro’s loving attention to his horse while he squeezed the life out of a caged bird was well handled. Yet Simon Neal seemed out of sorts as this murderous governor (and pulled out of a subsequent performance). Pappano and the orchestra compensated with chilling volleys and explosions from the pit.In the second act, Kratzer shreds any pretence at good theatrical behaviour. All imagery from the previous act has vanished. The blackness of Beethoven’s score in the revolutionary prelude – a straight path to Wagner – heralds not the usual dark dungeon but a bright room full of people, bystanders. We’ve left the 18th century, indicated only by a pedimented doorway, and joined selfie-obsessed modern life. The scene could be a contemporary art gallery, with Kaufmann resembling a hair-shirted John the Baptist splayed on one of Richard Long’s slate circle sculptures: a mere exhibit.There’s too much messy activity here, not least at the end when the reunited Leonore and Florestan have to change their clothes mid-song. The live video would be more effective if curtailed. The point that society turns its back until forced into understanding is true enough, but clunkily hammered home. If you can, go and see it live in cinemas on 17 March. Davidsen, her voice soaring, rich, unstoppable, started a little anxiously and rose to glory. The grand, choral finale is as noisy, joyful and heartbreaking as you’re likely to hear, terrifically sung by the ROH chorus. For those of us who love this work, more mysterious symphonic struggle than conventional opera, any chance to hear it is a high day.Beethoven spent years reworking Fidelio – from the first performance in 1805 to the final version in 1814 – while also completing other scores, among them the Fourth Piano Concerto. The American Jeremy Denk was soloist in a fresh, inventive and engrossing performance with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Osmo Vänskä. It was part of the LPO’s 2020 Vision series of works ning three centuries (in which the orchestra also performed Krzysztof Penderecki’s tender Chaconne in memory of John Paul II, 2005, and Enescu’s rampant and colourful Symphony No 1). Denk gave the left hand its own emphasis and vitality, helping us hear the structure, as well as the humour in Beethoven’s familiar but never knowable work. As an encore, Denk wowed everyone with an outrageous ragtime version of the Pilgrim’s Chorus from Tannhäuser. Raise a laugh from Wagner? This pianist manifestly did.Star ratings (out of five) Fidelio ★★★ London Philharmonic OrchestraVänskä ★★★★• Fidelio is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 17 March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2b868c25958e899eaeaa84d0b0318f0e6f870dc/0_0_5134_3423/master/5134.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98fb033d694053e4bd8da939a8845d57 480w","title":"gold the ultimate safety asset or a shiny relic of the past","story":"At times of uncertainty, people view gold as a low-risk, reliable store of value. We take a closer look at the well-known investment safe havenGold is the original precious metal. It is rich in symbolism but it’s also rich in function. Over millennia, it has been used for coins, jewellery, ornamentation, medals, electronic components, the basis of monetary systems and the titles of countless James Bond films. But, recently, people have been reminded of its historic use as a comparatively safe store of value.The bank was explaining why it still kept gold reserves. But during these times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, its words sparked media discussions about investors buying up gold in a flight to financial safety.Unlike cash, the value of gold isn’t eroded by inflation. It is highly fungible and can easily be converted into hard currency wherever you are in the world. In extreme cases, such as in war-torn countries, if you lose everything else, you can carry a couple of small gold bars out with you. It also has a great heritage and global branding given that people have historically relied on it during times of political turmoil. “For thousands of years gold has been a store of value,” says Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, the online consumer investing platform.In recent months, the value of gold has increased amid concerns about the global economy and the spectre of a full-scale trade war between the US and China. The price of gold hit £1,278 an ounce last September as large numbers of investors bought into the precious metal during something of a rush to so-called “safe-haven” assets. These are lower-risk assets that are expected to retain their value or even grow in value when other assets fall – thereby helping investors to limit their exposure to losses. “You want assets that perform when the stock market doesn’t,” says Lowcock.Other safe-haven investments include defensive stocks that are less vulnerable to economic downturns, such as utility companies, supermarkets and other businesses that provide everyday essentials. Likewise, bonds usually offer more predictable returns than shares, and certain currencies such as the Yen and Swiss Franc are also seen as safe-haven investments.But while gold arguably remains the best-known financial safe haven, its safety as an investment largely depends on what you’re looking for.One of gold’s chief disadvantages as an investment is that it doesn’t provide you with an income. It pays no interest or idends, unlike shares or cash on deposit. The only money you make on gold is capital appreciation when the price goes up. However, in an economic environment where interest rates are very low (and bond yields are also very low), a lack of income from gold may not be that much of an issue.A bigger problem perhaps is that gold prices can and do fluctuate – and often considerably. In Davos, in 2010, George Soros famously said: “When interest rates are low we have conditions for asset bubbles to develop, and they are developing at the moment. The ultimate asset bubble is gold.”It’s also worth remembering that all safe-haven investments have potential downsides. Indeed, the only safe haven that can’t lose you money is cash – although it can lose you value in high inflation environments and it generally provides a poor return in low inflation environments such as the one we’re currently in.Of course, economic fundamentals aside, centuries of symbolism mean that gold’s emotional and psychological value is unlikely to fade any time soon. And as our faith in our financial system is continually tested, perhaps it will one day come to symbolise the important value of safety as much as wealth.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

She died a few years later, while still in her teens or early 20s.In 1885, workers renovating the parish church of St Mary and St Eanswythe close to Folkestone harbour found a lead container of human remains in an alcove – probably hidden to avoid the destruction of relics during the Reformation.The bones, which comprised about half of a skeleton, were assumed to belong to Eanswythe. But it was not until January this year, following a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, that a team of experts set up a temporary laboratory in the church, which was closed for five days.Initial analysis suggested the bones were consistent with Eanswythe: they came from one person, probably female, probably aged between 17 and 20, and with no signs of malnutrition, so potentially a person with high status.A tooth and a foot bone were sent to Queen’s University Belfast for radiocarbon dating. The tests confirmed it was highly probable the person died in the mid-seventh century. Fears that the remains might be part of a medieval fad for fake relics were allayed.Andrew Richardson, of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, said: “It was a brave move by the church. We could have come out and said: ‘Folks, it’s not her.’ I was 50-50 about it, and a lot of colleagues were sceptical. But everything is consistent with it being her.”He said the result of the analysis was of national significance. “It now looks probable that we have the only surviving remains of a member of the Kentish royal family, and one of the earliest Anglo-Saxon saints.“There is more work to be done to realise the full potential of this discovery. But certainly the project represents a wonderful conjunction not only of archaeology and history, but also of a continuous living faith tradition at Folkestone from the mid-seventh century to the present day.”Lesley Hardy, the director of the Finding Eanswythe Project at Canterbury Christ Church University, said: “Folkestone is an extremely ancient place but much of its heritage has been erased through development in the 19th and 20th centuries. Eanswythe was at the centre of the community – people would have seen her as a local hero. To bring her back into the light is something quite special.”The findings were revealed at an event at St Mary and St Eanswythe’s on Friday evening. Andrew Plested, a church warden, said: “Obviously it’s what we wanted to hear.” He said he expected the relics to lead to an increase in pilgrims to the church.Funds will now be sought for further scientific analysis of the bones – including establishing DNA – and to ensure they are securely housed and displayed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f3fcad139dc2ba2292aaa1b56363e39d39f6504/183_72_1855_1114/master/1855.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc80f5d52bbdda4e188bb6bafebd8e07","title":"wigan zak hardaker world cup england","story":"Full-back is rejuvenated at Wigan after ban and arrest had put career in doubt having found happiness away from rugbyAnyone who has seen Zak Hardaker perform during the opening month of the new Super League season will know there is a swagger to his game, and a smile on his face. Hardaker’s Wigan side top the embryonic table and his early form was rewarded this past week with a return to the England fold – but crucially for the 28-year-old there is a smile on his face away from rugby, too.Barely a year has passed since Hardaker returned to rugby league promising he had changed for the better following a period of his life that left many suspecting his career in professional sport was over. A failed drugs test resulted in a 14-month ban then he was arrested for drink-driving in late 2018 as he was preparing to make his comeback.He had been involved in other misdemeanours earlier in his career and Hardaker’s fiercest critics are still waiting for him to trip up again. This time, however, you suspect something may be different: life away from his self-professed happy place, the rugby field, is as enjoyable as it is on it. “To say I’d be here, in this position, two years ago would be laughable,” he says.Hardaker has also been named in Wigan’s leadership group, another significant step for a player seeking to prove to his doubters that he is a better man post-suspension. “That’s a massive moment, for all the trophies I’ve won in my career … to be respected by your peers like that was massive,” he says. “The first thing I did was ring my mum and tell her.”Hardaker’s mother has been inundated with positive phone calls lately. On Tuesday she was told by her son that Shaun Wane, the new coach, had given him his first England call-up since 2015, with the Ashes against Australia to come at the end of this year. There is still plenty of club rugby to be played in 2020 but Hardaker already has one eye on the prospect of righting some personal wrongs at international level. “I’ve never played against the Aussies for various reasons – some of them my own – so to be in Shaun’s first squad is a big moment,” he says. “It hopefully shows I’ve been doing something right since I came back.”Hardaker withdrew from the 2013 World Cup squad because of an off-field incident, then his drugs ban cost him a place in the 2017 tournament. With a home World Cup on the horizon next year, there is plenty of motivation for him. “It’s always been my fault why I’ve missed the World Cup, and that’s something I want to put right,” he admits. “Shaun wants to put the pride back into England and I think we might have lost our way with that in the last couple of years. To be in his squad is a great starting point to make an impact.”Before then, however, there is the small matter of continuing Wigan’s strong start to the season against Hull KR on Sunday. Thriving in a new role at centre is somewhat fitting for Hardaker, who seems at ease with his new life away from rugby across the Pennines after a turbulent few years that he may finally be putting behind him for good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1d1fbdd595670edfe990d1348a9406edd2e5cc4/0_64_4690_2815/master/4690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea58dd49bedfaf1f83b1edc66ba9cc5b","title":"france six nations scotland","story":"Les Bleus go to Murrayfield with the grand slam in reach and Gaël Fickou says they now have the tools to challenge the bestFrance have arrived in the danger zone. A team that were treated dismissively by Eddie Jones at the start of the Six Nations, were sublime and sloppy against Italy and showed a depth of character in Cardiff missing from the side for a decade now have the title, and a grand slam, in sight. Expectation has replaced hope.A young side have not had to wrestle with the demons of the past because, for the majority of the squad, they were in someone else’s nightmare. On Sunday Les Bleus are at Murrayfield, a ground where they have not won for six years, but there are only two survivors from the XV that went down to Greig Laidlaw’s boot two years ago, Virimi Vakatawa, who was on the wing that afternoon, and the recalled prop Jefferson Poirot, while Baptiste Serin is again on the bench.France have so far played not so much without fear as with discipline. A team that spent most of the 2010s concocting various ways to lose, not least through poor decisions suggestive of a side that had just been thrown together, now have a sense of purpose under Fabien Galthié and his assistants, who include Shaun Edwards, a serial winner who enjoyed three grand slams with Wales and the 2013 title.Four of the past eight grand slam winners have defeated Scotland at this stage, three at Murrayfield, including Wales last year. The home side started with two defeats and victory in Rome, and are set for another bottom-half finish, but they have the best defensive record in the competition and largely failed to defeat Ireland and England because of squandered opportunities.“We hear the praise,” Galthié says. “Our goal is to win matches and titles, quickly, but the danger is there. We are well aware of it. We have a shared ambition and mission. There are promises, pleasure and dreams. Everyone is in this together. We are very much a collective.”Galthié has dropped the wing Teddy Thomas, who scored two tries against Scotland two years ago but suffered defensive lapses in the first three rounds. He makes way for Damian Penaud who was injured in the buildup to the England match, a wing who established his reputation at a time when France were struggling.Galthié is bidding to join a select band of five coaches, most of them French, who have won the grand slam as a player and as a head coach, but he would be the first to do so exclusively in the Six Nations era, having as a scrum-half been part of the France side that achieved the clean sweep in 2002 under Bernard Laporte.“Of course we are targeting the grand slam,” says the wing Gaël Fickou, one of the more experienced players in the squad having made his international debut seven years ago. “It would be a lie to say otherwise. We know we have a match to play before we can think about Ireland in Paris on the final weekend and it will be one of the hardest we have this year.“While we are not afraid to talk about the grand slam, we are aware of where we have come from and we remain humble. We have taken a very big step towards it, but we are not there yet. It will be a huge battle against the Scots who will want to bring us down. We are the hunted now, not the hunters, but it is harder hunting. A difference for us this year is that now we have the weapons to compete with other teams. In sport the wheel turns and we are starting to see the sun again.”Referee: Paul Williams (New Zealand).\u0026nbspAssistant referees: Wayne Barnes (England) and Frank Murphy (Ireland).It has been turning slowly for Scotland who have finished in the top half of the Six Nations twice since 2006, and then no higher than third. Victories over France and England in 2018 suggested an improvement but their only two championship victories since then have been against Italy, although they drew at Twickenham last year.After failing to qualify for the World Cup knockout stage and falling out with one of his best players, Finn Russell, Gregor Townsend needs a signal victory. The head coach is known for his attacking gameplans but tries have been scarce in Scotland’s matches this year. They have scored three, all against Italy, and conceded two, against Ireland and England, more impressive at forward than behind.“France are a very exciting team who have some great players but they also have chinks in their armour we will look to expose,” says the prop Zander Fagerson. “It will certainly be a challenge but one we can definitely win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36bd31591d9178c524b0b022c195f2ea5e4b9d6/307_102_2299_1379/master/2299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80e2b2e9fbfd2bc294f415d4657bf6c8","title":"why shouldnt women coach men tokyo olympics are ideal driver for equality","story":"People love seeing the best athletes competing together so let’s celebrate it and use it to our advantageWhen my brother, Jamie, and I were growing up we lived very close to the local tennis courts in Dunblane.

Like me, Amélie Mauresmo had struggled with nerves and had got over that hump of winning major events, and I felt she would understand me in that respect.The reaction to Amélie’s appointment as my coach, even from people close to me, was when I realised there was a problem. The reason they were questioning her was purely based on her sex it was not because of her ability or what she’d done in her career.I did well with Amélie and reached grand slam finals, but a lot of people saw the period when we worked together as a failure because I didn’t win a grand slam title. People blamed her for that, but that wasn’t the case with my other coaches – it was always me who was the problem, and I would get the criticism when I lost. With Amélie, the questions I would get asked a lot of the time after losing matches would be about our relationship. I’ve never had that at any other time in my career.Out of all the global sports, tennis is the best in terms of equal prize money and male and female players competing at the same events. But the thing I find interesting is, rather than being celebrated, this is often questioned within the sport. It’s attractive to people watching, sponsors, TV, everyone, so don’t waste your time arguing about it let’s celebrate it and actually use it to our advantage to grow the sport around the world.The Olympic Games also has an important role to play in promoting gender equality. People love watching the Olympics because they see the best male and female athletes. They are entertained by the mix of athletes and that’s one of the reasons why it’s the most successful sporting event. When I first competed at the Olympics in Beijing in 2008, I went along to watch the badminton mixed doubles and absolutely loved it. Similarly, people love watching mixed doubles in tennis more sports should look at these formats and think about what they can do and what fans may want.When I played mixed doubles with Serena Williams at Wimbledon last year it was a good example of how the format draws a slightly different crowd to the sport. Normally when I win or lose at Wimbledon, people will come up to me and say “well done” or “bad luck”. But, with Serena, so many people said: “We loved seeing you and Serena playing together. It was brilliant.” People enjoy seeing that, and we should promote it. How can you not see that it’s a good thing?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e24ea05872bfd8a3644a556868b0cd7c7afd226/0_0_2164_1298/master/2164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a07b160cecf8e4a912f8cc73876da7a","title":"my europe 27 things we love european union","story":"To celebrate Europe, writers in all 27 EU countries share a favourite place that evokes the spirit of their nationI often dream of the journey over the Taygetos mountains from the western coast of the Peloponnese peninsula to the town of Sparta. It’s a trip I’ve done many times, most recently with my family. You start by the beaches of Kalamata, where my daughter was born, and a mere 10-minute drive up a small winding road takes you into the mountains, with the white houses and sea below. This is the route Telemachus (Odysseus’ son) took to visit Menelaus and Helen, newly returned from Troy.It’s Greece, so these are proper mountains. The road crests at 1,600 metres, taller than Ben Nevis, and there is a Swiss chalet-style cafe here that serves good hot chocolate. We tend to stop a bit before, at the village of Artemisia, where the Theotokos taverna has a balcony overlooking a valley on one side and a spring on the other.Locals sell herbs and honey down by the spring and the waiters (the owner’s kids) fill up your jug from it. Just before Sparta is Mystra, the ruins of a Byzantine city (pictured). The top of its battlements is my favourite spot on Earth – mountains on one side, the white splash of Sparta on the other. All of history in one spot.Andrew BostockIt started with a mug. That was when I knew I’d been accepted into the fold at Capitano del Popolo, a bar and restaurant in the Umbrian outpost of Orvieto. I’d sought temporary refuge in the hilltop town after losing my job in Rome in 2016, and was soon enraptured by its charms. Capitano del Popolo quickly became my stomping ground, a convivial place to drink caffè latte from my personal mug – a gift from the wonderful owner and chef, Valentina Santanicchio – or enjoy one of her dishes, such as handmade pappardelle with wild boar ragù, while sitting on the terrace under an often-piercing blue winter sky and marvelling at the 14th-century palace across the square.Italy is brimming with history and culture, places to visit and things to do. Venice, Rome and Florence are itinerary staples, Orvieto less so. The town, with its imposing cathedral, fresh air, sublime views of the Umbrian countryside and friendships made, is now my number one place to escape to from Rome. I often describe Orvieto as a comfort blanket, which wrapped me in its warmth at a time when it was needed most.Angela GiuffridaThe Ostend seafront is one of the places in the EU to which the UK is (geographically) closest. This two-mile strip of Belgian coastline also offers one of the loveliest strolls in Europe. A five-minute walk from the railway station, the promenade starts with stalls selling fresh seafood and chips.Continuing west, the route passes seafront cafes, museums, belle époque houses, a modernist casino, the splendid Thermae Palace Hotel, a spooky sculpture in memory of the Ostendais artist Léon Spilliaert, and children pleased to be at a favourite Belgian beach. But it’s the sea itself that will keep you staring. A hypnotic expanse of water, shifting through black and white, with blue, green and gold reflections of the sky. You can’t see Margate on the British coast but it’s only about 65 miles away.When Charlotte Brontë arrived in Belgium in 1843, she wrote of her “prosperous and speedy voyage” from London Bridge Wharf along the north Kent coast and on to Ostend. Following the suspension of passenger services from Ramsgate 170 years later, there are sadly now no ferries to this windswept haven for passengers leaving England today. Thank goodness for Eurostar.Emily WaterfieldWarsaw’s Old Powązki cemetery captures better than almost any other place the essence of a continent that so readily defines itself in terms of its history. A resting place for generations of poets, writers and composers, the cemetery is most famous for its thousands of iron, bronze and stone tombs and sepulchral sculptures, as well as the chestnut trees, oaks and lindens that shelter you from the heavens above. But what captivates me most is the beauty and variety of the names of the great and the good of 19th- and early 20th-century Warsaw that lie below them.Many have wonderful foreign names that provoke nostalgia for a long-gone Poland that was genuinely multicultural: names like Paweł Pellizzaro, Henryk Leon Malhomme, Kazimierz Wolff-Zdzienicki, Wacław Malcolm-Morris, Matylda de Castellaz-Abramowicz. While others are, to me at least, simply glorious names in their own right: Fidelis Matuszewski, Jan Habdank-Stpiczynski, Karolina Semelman Neugebauer, Hipolit Flock and my own personal favourite, Felicjan Szmakfefer.Poland’s cemeteries are known for All Saints Day commemorations (1 November), when millions of Poles gather to lay candles on the graves of loved ones and national heroes. But I find the living’s habit of making the day about themselves can be irritating, and Powązki is best visited on a winter’s weekday afternoon, when you have only the dead for company – a perfect place to reflect on the future of a country and continent that refuses to rest in peace.Christian DaviesA defunct church is potentially an eerie place, but the former church of Absalon in Copenhagen’s hip Vesterbro district is always buzzing with life and laughter. In 2014, Lennart Lajboschitz, founder of the Flying Tiger retail chain, bought the building for £1.2m and exchanged the pews and altar for long tables, comfy sofas and a bar. Now around 700 people visit this community space every day: some come to enjoy a coffee, a chat and a game of backgammon or chess, others to work on their laptops.Every evening at 6pm up to 200 people gather in the main hall for a communal meal. At around £5 a plate, it’s an affordable dining-out option that attracts people of all ages and nationalities.Others come to attend one of numerous activities: yoga, tango lessons, quizzes, drag queen bingo, table tennis, dodgeball tournaments, bridge, life drawing, a writers’ workshop and crafts such as pottery and bookbinding. Some of these may also involve drinking Baileys … because, well, why not?Andrea BakI could spend all day on the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, a unique suspension railway system in Wuppertal. Which makes me a Schwebebahnliebhaberin (floating rail aficionado), a word as slinky as the monorail system itself, an elegant, airy, 13km engineering wonder which snakes its way through the Wupper valley (between Düsseldorf and Cologne), humming along the track between Barmen and Elberfeld, and must be one of the nearest experiences to flying.“Why drive, when you can float to work?” was the thinking at the turn of the 20th century, when commuter numbers were growing and construction work on it began. Industrialisation had caused the western German region to develop so quickly that there was no room for broader streets to take the increase in traffic, and so the decision was made to go high. Steel girder construction was all the rage at the time – Paris got its Eiffel Tower, Wuppertal its floating railway, complete with the strident green limbs that give it its height and majesty.The Kaiser and his wife took a ride on it in 1900, hence the Kaiserwagen (carriage 5) with its velvet upholstery and gold trimmings, which has since been restored and can be ridden at weekends. An even more famous journey was undertaken by a circus elephant called Tuffi, who was put on it as a publicity stunt in 1950 but panicked in the overcrowded carriage and plunged into the river Wupper below. She survived with only minor injuries, as did her story, which has been retold to German children ever since.Not only is it a pleasure to ride – ideally kneeling on a seat at the back looking out of the window on to city and river life below – but also very efficient, with a train running every four minutes and reasonably priced (€2.90 for an adult single, €7.20 for 24 hours). It remains the transport of choice for Wuppertalers, moving around 25 million passengers a year.Wuppertal is also home to the dance company of the late choreographer Pina Bausch, and the Schwebebahn features in the 2011 film Pina, Wim Wenders’ tribute to Bausch.Kate ConnollyIt’s not the tallest structure in Bulgaria. It’s not even the tallest TV tower in the country (that accolade goes to Rousse). But Kopitoto, or the Vitosha Mountain TV Tower to give it its official name, has defined Sofia’s skyline since the mid-1980s.Most people are quick to laud Kopitoto (which means “the hoof”) for the spectacular views it offers over the city – it stands at 186 metres (about double the height of Big Ben) on an outcrop of the 2,290-metre Vitosha mountain, around 20km from the city centre.As a sucker for brutalist architecture, I’ve always loved the sheer scale of this concrete marvel of engineering, which is hexagonal in shape – but with three of the six sides extended, it appears almost triangular. From the 1960s until the beginning of the 90s, there was a cable car that took you up the mountain. Now the defunct graffiti-laden terminus station, right next to the TV tower, attracts urban explorers. My only regret is that it doesn’t do tours. • Svetoslav Petrov, editor-in-chief of Boyscout magazine in BulgariaThe lifeblood of the trendy Letná district, Bio Oko cinema is the perfect place to immerse yourself in Czech culture. When I arrived a decade ago, I was here all the time, devouring every Czech-produced movie I could, trying to get to grips with the country’s dark history and offbeat humour. But it’s far more than just a cinema, and the bar outside the deckchair-strewn auditorium is a great hangout. It’s ideal for a quiet espresso during the day, but in the evening it springs into life with hip locals spilling out from the tables all the way up the stairs, drinking craft lager and eating delicious homemade quiche.The walls are lined with old communist-era movie posters, and many of these original prints are available to buy at the Terry Gilliam-inspired shop, Terry Posters (in sister cinema Kino Svtozor), from as little as €6. Mark PickeringIt’s fair to say that a few years ago Douglas Street, in Cork’s south inner city, an area blighted by the ill effects of anti-social behaviour, did not have the best of reputations. Walk along it today, however, and the historic thoroughfare, just five minutes from the city centre, has significantly been transformed.At the western end is the oasis of Nano Nagle Place, a former convent that in 2017 was converted into a complex that celebrates the extraordinary life of the eponymous 18th-century pioneer of Catholic education. There is a museum, a garden and a “sustainable foods cafe”, the Good Day Deli, in an airy modern glass pavilion.At the eastern edge is the primary engine of the area’s positive change: Coughlan’s. An almost 200-year-old “backstreet old man’s bar” taken over by musician and creative force Edel Curtin in 2012, Coughlan’s – which with pure Cork perverseness is pronounced “CAW-lans” – has since become the award-winning best music venue in the country.The intimate listening room in the formerly unloved lounge bar has a total capacity of no more than 65 seated, and yet Coughlan’s has managed to attract star American singer-songwriters Anaïs Mitchell, Ryley Walker and Sarah Jarosz, and leading Irish musicians such as Lisa O’Neill, Glen Hansard, Lisa Hannigan and Mick Flannery.It’s like a major venue in a music-savvy friend’s sitting room, with the added bonus of – so Coughlan’s claims, and with some justification – the best pint of stout in Cork.Philip WatsonThe village of Pyrga lies between Nicosia and Larnaca in the east of Cyprus. It’s a pretty place, the sort that Peter Mayle might have settled in had Provence not got him first. As it is, Pyrga’s only claim to fame is that it is home to a remarkable stone building. It could be mistaken for an old storeroom, except the gothic detail above the door hints at something more special. This building is a medieval royal chapel.Inside, damaged but beautiful frescos look as if they have been transported from medieval France. They tell the story of the marriage of King Janus to Charlotte de Bourbon in 1411, and betray the fact that Cyprus was a medieval French kingdom. Its rulers were the Lusignans, cousins to the English Plantagenets and as the chapel’s garrulous caretaker will tell you, Queen Charlotte is an ancestor of the UK’s current queen.Cyprus has not always been comfortable with its medieval heritage. For some, celebrating this French period and subsequent Venetian rule undermines the claim that Cyprus is a Greek island. Yet the Lusignans and their heirs left some stunning monuments, which easily overshadow the Roman remains at sites like Kourion. Apart from Pyrga, Kolossi and Limassol have two of the most intact Crusader castles , and the capital, Nicosia, is encircled by massive Venetian walls.Most dramatic of all, in the middle of Nicosia, sits the huge 13th-century French gothic Cathedral of St Sophia, which was converted into the the Selimiye Mosque in 1570. For a lover of medieval culture like myself, these gothic churches – many of which have been converted into mosques or subsumed into Byzantine structures – make Cyprus an unexpected revelation.Michael Paraskos, novelist and lecturerTwo former railway sheds are now home to one of the most exciting cultural spaces in Luxembourg City, which is aimed at sharing ideas and fostering new talent. Built in 1877 to store steam locomotives, the Rotondes remained underutilised throughout the 20th century (one was a warehouse, the other a bus garage). A decade ago the ministry of culture started to renovate these national monuments to host cultural activities, reopening them five years ago.The Northern roundhouse now hosts exhibitions, lectures, dance, secondhand markets and other events. The Southern roundhouse is a dark, cosy bar that holds quiz nights, concerts and theatre performances. The building between them houses Radio ARA, where I work.Once winter is over, the outdoor courtyard is filled with pallet furniture and people drinking and eating – bankers, hipsters, mums, musicians – the place is a magnet for all types, like Luxembourg itself.Wendy Winn, radio presenterRiga is an architecturally eclectic place with an incredible variety of coexisting styles: you can see the finest examples of art deco, alongside brutalist Soviet architecture and neoclassical buildings. One of my favourite places to visit is Riga Central Market, a Unesco world heritage site on the banks of the Daugava a few hundred metres from the old town. It’s a wondrous blend of art deco and neoclassicism, and when it opened in 1930 it was recognised as not only the largest, but also one of the best marketplaces in Europe.The five pavilions are former zeppelin hangars, and beneath each cavernous ceiling is a specialist market selling vegetables, dairy, meat, fish and local specialities. Riga doesn’t have a historic cafe tradition like Paris or Vienna, but the place to meet artists and bump into writers or musicians is the Cafe Osiris restaurant, which has had a loyal clientele for 25 years. Owner Andrejs Žagars says: “It’s the only cafe that reflects part of Riga as it was at the beginning of the 1990s. This place ... is an authentic proof of the time when Riga was changing, when Latvia was changing.”With its simple yet refined menu, Cafe Osiris is one of my favourite places to eat in the city, and we’ve used it to host Riga Biennial dinners for visiting artists on many occasions.Agniya Mirgorodskaya, founding director of the Riga Biennial FoundationAs the Eurostar makes its way through northern France’s post-industrial heartland, passengers en route to Paris or Brussels just want to be on their way, which is a pity. In Roubaix, one of the grittier towns in a region once famous for its mines and factories, sits a jewel called La Piscine, an art deco swimming baths transformed into a museum. It doesn’t look much from the outside, but step into the pool hall, with its mosaic tiles and enamelled-brick showers, and the starburst stained-glass windows cast a magical glow over a collection of nude statues and sculptures from various artists and periods posed around the pool.When I visited for the first time, the museum was almost empty and the effect was breathtaking. The frozen figures look as if they’re about to take – or have just taken – a dip in the rippling water.There is more to La Piscine: its permanent collection, which has now been extended into a former factory next door, includes works by Giacometti, Rodin, Claudel and Picasso. But the pool hall alone is worth the visit. Get off the train at Lille and take the metro for 30 minutes to Roubaix. Paris and Brussels can wait.Kim WillsherUnlike most European capitals, Bratislava is not overcrowded. Even so, it’s hard to believe that, tucked just behind the Eurovea shopping mall, there’s such a relaxing, crowd-free spot. I discovered this Danube river walk when I was working in the city and would slip off at lunchtime to stroll beside the water and watch the ducks foraging for food. There are usually couples and colleagues picnicking along the bank, but it’s also dotted with great cafes and restaurants. My favourite is Primi, a chic, Mediterranean-style eatery that serves terrific sea bass and bowls of tasty gazpacho. I actually had my first date with my now husband here – it must have had a certain kind of magic.If you head over Starý most – a newly renovated pedestrian and tram bridge – the opposite bank offers an incredible view of Bratislava castle, especially dazzling at sunset. The “botel” and restaurant Dunajský Pivovar offers a good gawping spot, as well as some excellent Slovakian cuisine. For the complete Bratislava experience, order a plate of traditional halušky (potato dumplings with sheep’s cheese) and a summery pint of the homemade brew. Markéta HorváthováWay up north, surrounded by meadows and forests, the border between Sweden and Finland consists of lively rapids called Kukkolaforsen, part of the larger River Torne. The area has a long history of log-driving, war and smuggling, and four languages are spoken here: Swedish, Finnish, Sámi and Meänkieli – a minority language closely related to Finnish. Midsummer the sun is up all hours at midwinter it never rises.The tiny village of Kukkola is the unofficial sauna capital of Sweden. I warmly recommend a sweaty session in the village sauna, a large log cabin that can accommodate 65 fiery enthusiasts on three levels of long benches, heated by a large aggregate that holds 600kg of stone. Afterwards you can take a cooling dip in the stream, then head to the local inn for specialities like moose, gravadlax in a cup and coffee cheese with cloudberries.For a historic sauna experience, follow the river north a bit to the aromatic 300-year-old smoke sauna of Matkakoski – thought to be the oldest sauna in Sweden still in use. Nearby you can fish for whitefish and salmon and forage for berries and mushrooms. Jens Linder, chefVisitors are always impressed by Tallinn’s old town and fall in love with the local cuisine. But, when they venture out of the city they’re even more amazed by the open spaces, untouched nature, long empty beaches, and bus stops seemingly in the middle of nowhere.Estonia is small (about a fifth the size of the UK) and around half of the country is covered in forest, making it very easy to escape and not see another person. Approximately one-fifth is protected under its five national parks and nature reserves. A network of hiking trails crosses the country, quite literally off the beaten path. Lahemaa national park has a mix of forest, bog and seashore Kõrvemaa nature reserve is great for birdwatching and Soomaa national park is unique – it floods every year, so is only accessible by kayak.But my favourite national park is Matsalu, known for birdwatching – it is home to over 200 different species. In spring the trees come to life with the sound of thousands of birds chirping. The birdsong is indescribably beautiful it’s like a symphony and therapy for the soul. Like many Estonians, I have a country house that I escape to – mine is near Matsalu and has a hot tub and sauna for soaking in post-exploring.Kristina LuppBudapest has long been marked by grand cafes, pastry shops and, above all, by the Danube flowing between the steep hills of ancient Buda and the expensive villas of Pest on the other side, comprising a wild profusion of building styles.In the heart of Pest there is a small interior courtyard: 10 Magyar utca.You can cut through it by day, proceeding through the quiet Magyar utca gate, stepping over silent wooden cobbles, to the busy Múzeum körút. Built by Miklós Ybl in 1852, four years after the failure of the 1848 revolution and 15 years before the establishment of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the courtyard is an eclectic, beautifully proportioned, faintly Venetian blend of classic and romantic.Much of Budapest is empire grandeur under bombardment. This is not. There are spaces that hold you through colour, air, texture and proportion. The first time you see Giotto’s Pazzi Chapel in Florence, you feel it.If Budapest has a humane soul, it is something like this. You breathe differently here. You hope for more. George SzirtesOne of my favourite places in Bucharest is the National Museum of Contemporary Art (MNAC). It was here that I discovered avant-garde Romanian art, which has flourished ever since the 1970s, when dictator Nicolae Ceausescu stopped imposing the socialist-realist style.The museum is in the neoclassical Casa Poporului, or the Palace of the Parliament, the second-largest government building in the world after the Pentagon and the embodiment of Ceausescu’s ego and ambition: building it required an entire neighbourhood of about six square kilometres to be bulldozed and 57,000 families relocated.Getting to the museum is an adventure in itself, especially if you’re wearing high heels, as it’s a walk of a good seven minutes from the gates to the entrance.It’s not just the contrast with the totalitarian undertones of the Palace that sets MNAC apart. On the top-floor terrace of the museum, you can enjoy a glass of lemonade or an occasional gig, and take in the best view of Romania’s isive new People’s Salvation Cathedral, which cost the country about €400m. Paula ErizanuHook of Holland is an odd place to love. Go there and look south, and you’ll see one of the densest concentrations of industry in Europe: giant cranes, chimneys smoking like upturned cigars, and massive cargo ships rumbling their way from the Rhine into the North Sea. Yet head north and you’ll see something different: an arc of empty white sand stretching for miles. On a sunny day, you could almost be in Thailand.The appeal lies partly in the beach’s beauty, but also in the way it captures the spirit of the Netherlands: beautiful but industrious, peaceful but dynamic. It’s a crossroads where culture and history have always blended, like ingredients in a cocktail.I first came to the Hook a decade ago, soon after I moved to the Netherlands, when I lived just up the coast. Later, my wife and I were married in the sand dunes. Now, I come here often with our little daughter and watch her play in the waves. Sitting on the sand with a plate of fresh fish, we’re nearly as close to Essex as Maastricht. Britain feels tantalisingly close, yet also very far away.Ben Coates, author of The Rhine: Following Europe’s Greatest River from Amsterdam to the Alps (John Murray Press, £9.99)If you’re a wise enough traveller to know that Slovenia is well worth a visit, then you’ll be sure to see the delightful capital, Ljubljana, and will doubtless head off to fairytale Lake Bled, dolloped by a church-topped island and with a Grimm castle looming on a clifftop above it.The question, then, is: what else you should see, beyond the Big Two attractions? My favourite place in my adopted homeland is the medieval town of Kamnik. Once a far more important city than Ljubljana, it was the feudal stronghold of the Bavarian Andechs clan, who made it a stop on trade routes between Budapest in the east and Venice to the west.Today the town boasts three castles, hiking trails close to the centre, an important rare books library, rich industrial heritage (the KIK factory here once produced much of the gunpowder for the Austro-Hungarian army and the Stol factory exported Thonet rocking chairs to the US), and may have the most microbreweries per capita in the world (six for a population of around 10,000). At the foot of the Kamnik-Savinja mountain range, it is also an ideal gateway to the sunny side of the Alps, a 10-minute drive from the Velika Planina mountain plateau , the closest you’ll get to Middle Earth in Middle Europe. Noah Charney, author of Slovenology: Living and Traveling in the World’s Best CountryMy favourite place in Vienna – and indeed in Austria – is one that conjures up the most vivid image of the former multi-ethnic and multilingual western half of the Habsburg empire: the chamber of the former House of Commons (Sitzungssaal des Abgeordnetenhauses) in the old Imperial Parliament (Reichsrat). It’s largely unused since the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918 (except for the swearing-in of the president) miraculously, it also escaped wartime bombing.What is splendid and moving about it, aside from its size, beauty and sense of history, is the fact that representatives from almost all parts of the empire gathered there from 1883. German speakers from Austria itself and also from Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Carniola and Bukovina, as well as Czechs, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Italians, Romanians and even one member of the Jewish National Party, all elected on the basis of universal male suffrage after 1907, met in this chamber. For all the linguistic chaos and political isions, the riotous and boisterous filibustering, the subterfuges and boycotts, it somehow functioned as the world’s first multinational parliament.In 1918 it became redundant and the inidual nations went their own way, leaving the leaders of the new Austrian Republic too few to fill the former Imperial Chamber. Subsequent decades saw conflict between many of the nations that had been part of Austria-Hungary, culminating in the Balkan wars of the 1990s this chamber is reminiscent of gentler times, when all nations of the monarchy – no matter their disagreements or even hatreds – were able to contain themselves in a usually civilised arena rather than resort to violence.The modern-day EU parliament, with its 705 MEPs representing 27 countries, is perhaps its heir, though it lacks its magic and gravitas.At the moment, the Imperial Parliament building is closed for rebuilding and refurbishment, and will remain so until 2021. The glorious former House of Commons chamber itself will undergo a mere clean-up and a few repairs, and will return to its full splendour.Christopher BrennanMO museum, which opened in October 2018, changed everything in Vilnius. Not only is it an incredible place for Lithuanian modern art, it’s also an example of new-wave Lithuanian philanthropy. The museum was funded by two Lithuanian scientists and designed by architects at Studio Libeskind. It’s a striking building, at the intersection of the old town and the city’s more recent westwards expansion.MO museum recently had a wildly successful exhibition called The Origin of Species: the 1990s DNA. I went four times, because it really was a way to relive our recent history – the wild 1990s, the starting point of capitalism in Lithuania, the foundation of our modern, democratic state.You could relive experiences such as trying on new jeans in winter while standing on a piece of cardboard in Gariūnai (the infamous open-air market 20 minutes outside Vilnius) buying one cigarette from a kiosk and watching movies on a VHS player.There are permanent exhibitions of Lithuanian modern art as well – my favourite painter is the postmodernist Šarūnas Sauka. The museum also has a boutique cinema, a cafe and a small shop full of great Lithuanian art, jewellery and books. At the moment, preparations are being made for a huge exhibition showcasing the works of cult British film director Peter Greenaway. Artificial rain is said to be part of the show’s experience. Neringa RekasiuteTwo or three times a week for the past 18 years, I have shopped in Barcelona’s Santa Caterina market. It’s a social event as much as a shopping expedition and not somewhere you can go in a hurry because there are always updates on children, illnesses, operations and deaths to be discussed. It has a very Mediterranean, familial vibe.I often have breakfast in the market bar, Bar Joan, a family affair run by Joan and his sons and daughters. They know their customers well and no sooner do I pull up a red vinyl stool than one of them is fixing me a café con leche and calling to the kitchen for a bikini (toasted ham and cheese). They also make a fine tortilla de patatas.One morning I sat next to a man who breakfasted on tripe and beer followed by a carajillo (coffee with a splash of cognac). Spanish men of a certain age often kick off the day with a hit of booze, frequently red wine. Even after living here for 20 years I can’t imagine drinking wine at 8am, which is probably just as well.Stephen BurgenIn Malta’s capital city there are more than 25 churches displaying incredible baroque paintings and architecture. In the oratory of the church of the Order of St John, which is a true gem of high baroque, there is a painting that I really admire and always moves me: Caravaggio’s Beheading of St John the Baptist.Included in the ’s list of the 10 greatest works of art ever, and once described as “the painting of the 17th century”, it is as alive now as it has ever been, and with a message that is still relevant: life and death, youth against old age, the contrast of colours, with light and dark captured by the astounding chiaroscuro technique of the eccentric genius. It reveals not only the story but the very self of the artist, and engulfs the observer in its theatrical action, sparking our emotions too.There are many historical sites to visit in Valletta – the Grand Master’s Palace, Casa Rocca Piccola (a “living” 16th-century palazzo), the Malta National Community Art Museum – but Caravaggio’s masterpiece is the one I always come back to. A visit to the cathedral and its oratory is by far the highlight of the Valletta experience.Fra Nikola Soukmandjiev, diplomat, priest and tour guideThe air is heavy with the scent of wild rosemary, sage and pine as I cycle along the path that skirts Lošinj’s north-western headlands.They call Lošinj “the island of vitality”, and this is more than mere marketing guff. Wild herbs blanket this long, spindly island that dangles into the Kvarner Gulf south of Rijeka, and the smell of them instantly gives me a lift during my meandering bike ride through the pines.Every now and then I park my bike and plunge into the impossibly clear water. I love the fact that the beaches that ring Lošinj are – like most of those in Croatia – pebbly rather than sandy. Some of them take a bit of effort to reach, usually involving a long hike down a rocky trail, if you don’t have your own boat.This all adds to the rough-and-ready ruggedness you get away from the big beach resorts. Simplicity is the key, and you can taste it in the grilled fish served at waterside restaurants and the giant rounds of bread baked under a cast-iron bell.It’s this gentle assault on all the senses that I appreciate every time I go to Croatia’s Adriatic coast – from the vivid blue-green of the sea to the heady fragrance of herbs and pine that have been baked in the heat. Total bliss.Mary NovakovichWhen democracy returned to Portugal in the spring of 1974, the Portuguese celebrated by throwing themselves into building a “modern” nation state (with the aid, later, of EU funding). While I love the bright lights and cosmopolitan vibe of Lisbon and Porto, it is the vestiges of “old” Portugal that really enchant me. To find them, just step into any neighbourhood pastelaria (cafe-bakery). You’ll find the day’s newspaper on a table, the footie on the TV and friends shooting the breeze over average-tasting but cheap (less than €1) café expressos.In Portugal, pastelarias double as repositories of local pride. Aside from the ubiquitous pastel de nata (the famous creamy custard tart, now available in M\u0026ampS), every self-respecting Portuguese town boasts its own speciality sweet. Cernache do Bonjardim has its almond cartuchos (shells) Castro Daire its bolo podre (literally, “rotten cake”) Chaves its meat-filled pastel. My favourite is the sugary, eggy palha (straw) sweet from the historic city of Abrantes in the centre of the country. For the real deal, head to Confeitaria Palha de Abrantes on the main square: Portugal, in a single bite. Oliver BalchThe Midnight Sun Film Festival, established in 1986, enjoys a stellar reputation among cinephiles and moviemakers. A true celebration of the craft, the five-day festival skips the red carpets and invites the audience and acclaimed international directors to the small village of Sodankylä, in Finnish Lapland, to enjoy the round-the-clock feature film screenings each June, when the sun blazes above the horizon day and night.The programme ranges from premieres and rarities to classics and oddities, from silent films to karaoke singalong shows in a former circus tent. The morning discussion sessions with directors are a much-loved tradition, but not everybody makes it to those – the price of wrecking one’s circadian rhythm with high doses of sunshine.The laid-back atmosphere and lack of hierarchy encapsulate something of the Finnish propensity for happiness (Finland has topped the world’s “happy league” for the past two years). At an intimate festival whose whole ethos is to celebrate a love of cinema, one feels comfortable sharing a drink, a story or even a sauna with a random film buff or a world-famous film director – former guests include Francis Ford Coppola, Mike Leigh and Terry Gilliam.

We are in a cafe down the road from where she lives in south London, and as she gets the coffees in, she explains that she was up for most of the night with her two young daughters, who are five and two. They wanted to ask her questions about space. Having established the location of the sun and the moon, her two-year-old then started going through a list of everyone she knows. “And saying who she likes, and who she doesn’t like – oh my God, it’s three in the morning,” says Haggard, giggling. “So this will be a really bad interview.”It isn’t usually proper to describe any person over the age of 12 as giggly, but Haggard is irrepressibly giggly, and it is infectious. She has the air of a person who seems either delighted by everything, or delighted by the potential of everything to be entertaining. It makes sense that her career has been heavy on the funny stuff because, in person, she is very funny, and she appears to have been in almost every decent British comedy of the last 20 years or so, from Man Stroke Woman to Uncle to Psychoville to Episodes. Last year, she wrote and starred in her own, the brilliantly idiosyncratic Back to Life, about a woman returning to her home town after serving a life sentence. It rightly appeared on many of 2019’s best-of lists.Today, though, and appropriately, given the bad night’s sleep, she is here to talk about Breeders, in which she stars. Haggard plays Ally, who is married to Paul (Martin Freeman), and the show deals with the more exasperating side of parenthood. It came from an idea Freeman had, and as Paul he regularly loses his rag, occasionally calling the kids rude names to their faces. They have stunt scripts that they use for the scenes with the child actors that substitute the swear words for less crude language. “Unfortunately, I find it hilarious,” says Haggard, setting herself off. “You have fudge, which is a bit boring, but the one that just killed me was that rather than cock, it was clock. I couldn’t get through that scene. I got hysterical.”Along with comedies such as The Letdown and Motherland, Breeders shows the unvarnished side of life with young kids. Why does she think there is an appetite for that? “There’s a line I say, which is: ‘Who is happy with two kids under the age of seven?’” she says. “It’s not shiny, parenting. I am someone who genuinely loves it, but it is lovely when you see people behaving worse than you as parents.” Try as she might, however, Haggard can’t hide the fact that, unlike the characters in Breeders, she does seem to love being a parent. She admits this in exaggeratedly hushed tones. “Me and my husband were saying: ‘We’re really having fun.’ I think because I’m a bit of an idiot and so is my husband. So we were like: ‘Two more total twats to play with.’”When she auditioned for Breeders, she had only just had her second baby, and she taped herself for it in her kitchen. “I had the newborn baby in a car seat that I was jigging, and my other child was watching In the Night Garden, and I was a bit angry because I was tired.” She laughs. “We had such a small window before she started screaming, and I thought: ‘I’m never going to get it.’” But for a show about harried parents it is easy to see why it did the trick. The tape went down well enough for her to be called in to read with Freeman.Haggard shot a pilot for Breeders, then went straight into filming Back to Life, which she co-wrote with Laura Solon. Haggard has been writing since she was a child, but this was the first of her scripts to make it to screen. She was 40 when it came out (she’s 41 now), and seems thrilled by the fact her previously steady career has taken off when it has. “My priorities are so clear: I don’t need to be rich, I don’t need to run the world, I just need to earn as much as I can to support everyone, then have a big break and be with them.” She is careful to acknowledge that it’s different for everyone, but she has worked more since she’s had kids, and has made that work for her. On the Nick Helm comedy Uncle, she asked for a clause in her contract that allowed her to take breaks for breastfeeding. “We need to make sure people don’t feel like they’re out of the game just because they decide to have a family.”Back to Life came from Haggard’s curiosity about the way women are vilified for serious crimes in a way that men are not. It tells the story of Miri, a curiously optimistic woman who returns to her parental home having served 18 years in prison for an initially unspecified but clearly very bad crime. “We’re so much less forgiving of women, aren’t we? When a guy kills someone, we’re like, awww.” She puts on a cute voice. “‘Poor guy. Got so much testosterone.’ And I always found that really fascinating.”Even though it is a comedy, Back to Life has plenty of dark moments, and I wonder if it changed the perception of her as a familiar funny face. “I think probably, yes. I think people thought: ‘Oh, she doesn’t just do a strange noise.’” As Myra, the humourless comedy exec in Episodes, she did do a strange noise, as well as appearing alongside Matt LeBlanc. “I had someone babysitting, and she’d Googled me, and … ” she giggles, “she started crying because I’d met Joey.”Haggard had not planned to specialise in comedy. “I thought I was very serious,” she says. “I remember being down to two jobs, and one was a serious gritty northern drama, playing a footballer. I did not do well in the football audition. And one was a comedy.” It felt like a fork in the road, and she got the comedy. “But actually, comedy is brilliant. If you’re not afraid to be a complete idiot, which I’ve never been afraid to do, then just do comedy, because it’s really fun.”I ask which shows she thinks were turning points in her career. She gamely says she thought they all were. “I always think: ‘This is the one!’ I worked in a gym on reception and I quit six times. ‘Goodbye! I have got the job! The one! I am in Green Wing, I’ve got six scenes, I’ll see you around.’” She leaves a perfect beat. “‘Hello, can I come back?’ That was my life.”She has spoken before about how her father Piers Haggard, who directed Pennies from Heaven and the John Mills version of Quatermass, was not keen on her becoming an actor and tried to dissuade her from it as a teenager. “I think now he’s OK,” she concedes. He had, she says, always supported her writing. “So I think he’s really happy I wrote something that was made.” When she was 11, she wrote a film that, astonishingly, has never seen the light of day. “It started off all right, then you can see where I hit puberty. Suddenly, the painter-decorator arrives, he removes his top and it all gets a little bit horny. I remember my dad reading it and going: ‘This is quite good at the beginning,’ then going, ‘Oh, God ... ’”We finish our coffees. Haggard wants to get some more writing done on the second series of Back to Life, and she is excited about what she is going to write next when that is done. She has four ideas, she says. Will the painter-decorator make an appearance? “Maybe not the Brad Pitt handyman,” she giggles. “Not that, but something else. I’m going to write some films and a drama.” And, of course, she’ll still be funny. “I want to write something really silly, as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0423aab395e588566738a55caff1665d0c06d2a/0_0_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859c5cd1b667f5bf12ceb9a64db043e3","title":"tell us how is coronavirus affecting your day to day life","story":"We want to hear about how coronavirus has impacted your daily life.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 6 March, the global death toll was 3,404, while more than 100,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.The death toll has passed 3,000 in China, where there have been over 80,000 cases. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, has had 6,593 cases. More than 55,000 people in China have recovered from Covid-19.There have been 164 recorded cases and two fatalities to date in the UK, with 20,338 people tested. There are 60 recorded cases in Australia, with two deaths.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecab4c1eedc808de960a5088d780bbb89dc657cf/13_153_2187_1313/master/2187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00ddca71735ecda6d7ed23be17a75c9","title":"coronavirus thousands stranded on grand princess cruise ship after 21 cases confirmed","story":"Crew and passengers from more than 50 countries stuck on ship moored off San Francisco, as global infections pass 100,000 markNearly half of the 46 people tested for coronavirus onboard the Grand Princess cruise ship moored off San Francisco have returned a positive result, vice president Mike Pence has said, and the fate of its more than 3,500 passengers and crew from more than 50 countries remains unclear.Pence said 21 positive results had been recorded – 19 crew members and two passengers – and that “those that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those who will require medical help will receive it.” He urged elderly Americans to consider carefully taking future cruises during the crisis.There is little detail as to where quarantined and sick passengers will be taken. Previously, military sites have been used to quarantine holidaymakers from the Diamond Princess, moored off Yokohama. On the Grand Princess, some passengers have already complained about the handling of the situation, saying they learned of the coronavirus cases from media reports, and there are concerns for one passenger who has stage 4 cancer.There are 2,422 guests and 1,111 crew on the vessel, with more than 140 Britons and four Australians among them.Meanwhile, Florida reported two deaths, the first US fatalities outside the west coast. Health officials said two people in their 70s who had travelled overseas died, one in Santa Rosa County and the other near Fort Myers. The US death toll is now 16.Globally, the virus has now killed nearly 3,500 people and infected more than 100,000 across 92 nations and territories. Italy and Iran have become the latest hotspots with sharp rises in confirmed cases, recording 4,636 and 4,747 respectively.The US government plans to take the Grand Princess to a “non-commercial port” where all the passengers and crew would be tested, however, President Donald Trump said on Friday he would prefer not to allow the passengers onto American soil.“I like the numbers being where they are,” said Trump, who appeared to be explicitly acknowledging his political concerns about the outbreak: “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.”Closer to the epicentre of the global outbreak, Hong Kong further sealed itself off from the outside world, with authorities advising Hongkongers against all non-essential travel abroad, and making all arrivals complete a health declaration form.Previously, the measure, which will come into force from Sunday, was required only for mainland Chinese passengers. The city has reported 106 cases and two deaths in the past six weeks, according to its health officials.In Australia, authorities are working to trace about 70 patients of a doctor who continued to see patients despite falling ill with coronavirus-like symptoms. He fell ill in the US during a flight from Denver to San Francisco on 27 February before flying back to Melbourne and working throughout the following week. He was later confirmed to have the virus and Toorak clinic, where he works, has since been closed.Victoria’s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said: “I have to say I am flabbergasted that a doctor that has flu-like symptoms has presented to work,” Mikakos said.Equally astonished were police in Sydney, who appealed for calm after a brawl broke out between three women in a supermarket over toilet paper amid continued panic buying. “We just ask that people don’t panic like this when they go out shopping,” said acting inspector Andrew New from New South Wales police. “There is no need for it. It isn’t the Thunderdome, it isn’t Mad Max, we don’t need to do that.“There is no need for people to go out and panic buy at supermarkets, paracetamol and canned food or toilet paper.”In the meantime, passengers aboard the Grand Princess remained holed up in their rooms as they awaited word about the fate of the ship. Some said ship officials only informed them of the confirmed coronavirus cases after they first learned about it from news reports.Passenger Kari Kolstoe, a retiree from North Dakota has stage-4 cancer and is particularly concerned. Kolstoe, 60, said she and her husband, Paul, 61, had looked forward to the cruise to Hawaii as a brief, badly needed respite from the grind of medical intervention she has endured for the past 18 months.Now facing the prospect of a two-week quarantine far from home in Grand Forks, she worried their getaway cruise will end up causing a fateful delay in her next round of chemotherapy, scheduled to begin early next week.“It’s very unsettling,” she said in a telephpone interview from the ship on Friday. “It’s still a worry that I’m going to not get back.”Besides the implications for cancer treatment is the fear of falling ill from exposure to a respiratory virus especially dangerous to older people with chronic health conditions and suppressed immunity. “I’m very at risk for this,” said Kolstoe, whose rare form of neuroendocrine cancer has spread throughout her body. “Me staying on here for a lot of reasons isn’t good.”Steven Smith and his wife, Michele, of Paradise, California, went on the cruise to celebrate their wedding anniversary. They said they were a bit worried but felt safe in their room, which they had left just once since Thursday to video chat with their children. Crew members wearing masks and gloves delivered trays with their food in covered plates and left them outside their door.To pass the time they have been watching television, reading and looking out the window, they said. “Thank God, we have a window!” Steven said.An epidemiologist who studies the spread of virus particles said the recirculated air from a cruise ship’s ventilation system, plus the close quarters and communal settings, made passengers and crew vulnerable to infectious diseases. “They’re not designed as quarantine facilities, to put it mildly,” said Don Milton of the University of Maryland. “You’re going to amplify the infection by keeping people on the boat.”Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public-health failure, with the vessel essentially becoming a floating germ factory.In the US, officials in Austin cancelled this year’s SXSW festival, a major tech and music conference, amid coronavirus concerns. SXSW, which draws 400,000 visitors, was scheduled for 13 to 22 March.Austin’s mayor, Steve Adler, said: “I’ve gone ahead and declared a local disaster in the city and associated with that, have issued an order that effectively cancels SXSW.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c64159171038b3bdd957d444ad8d36057fc633a/0_39_1860_1117/master/1860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=324c877008364c559902c8e974156db0","title":"saudi arabia detains three royal family members in latest crackdown","story":"Royal relatives accused of plotting to oust King Salman and successor Crown Prince Mohammed bin SalmanSaudi authorities have detained three royal family members including two senior princes, according to US media reports, signalling the crown prince is further tightening his grip on power.Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch’s nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were taken from their homes early on Friday by royal guards after being accused of treason, the Wall Street Journal reported citing unnamed sources. The pair were allegedly plotting to oust King Salman and the son he has designated to succeed him, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, it reported.The New York Times also reported the detentions, adding that Prince Nayef’s younger brother Prince Nawaf bin Nayef had also been detained.Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The detentions mark the latest crackdown by the de facto ruler crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated his reign with the imprisonment of prominent clerics and activists as well as princes and business elites.The crown prince, the king’s son, has also faced a torrent of international condemnation over the murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate in October 2018.Prince Ahmed, said to be in his 70s, had returned to the kingdom from his base in London in the aftermath of the Khashoggi scandal, in what some saw as an effort to shore up support for the monarchy.In June 2017, the crown prince had edged out Prince Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister, to become heir to the Arab world’s most powerful throne.At the time, Saudi television channels showed the crown prince kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence.Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities.“Prince Mohammed is emboldened – he has already ousted any threats to his rise and jailed or murdered critics of his regime without any repercussion,” Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based Rand Corporation, said of the latest crackdown.“This is a further step to shore up his power and a message to anyone – including royals – not to cross him.”The detentions come at a sensitive time as Saudi Arabia bars Muslim pilgrims from Islam’s holiest sites to contain the coronavirus outbreak.The kingdom has suspended the “umrah” year-round pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading to Mecca and Medina, raising uncertainty over the upcoming hajj – a key pillar of Islam.The oil-rich kingdom is also grappling with plunging price of crude, its major source of revenue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6c51af39939e25805f0a8c71bd3560d5dc0d3ea/0_1991_4644_2786/master/4644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9241cee33a2993f914c2e20ea4cb9868","title":"we have a no politics rule how families can heal their brexit rifts","story":"Now Britain has left the EU, the fractures remain. Is it possible to bury the political hatchet?A bigoted old bastard: that’s how Letitia Clark thought of her dad, Tony, when she found out he had voted to leave. She worked in a restaurant, where many of her colleagues were EU migrants, and was dating an Italian. “He disappeared for a while,” she says of her father. “I think it was a wish to avoid conflict.”The vote played a significant role in Letitia’s decision to move with her then boyfriend to Sardinia, where she still lives and has written a cookbook, Bitter Honey, about Sardinian cuisine. She and her two brothers – a journalist in Cape Town, and a captain in the Royal Marines who travels all over the world – lead very different lives from Tony’s in quiet, rural Devon.Tony gets a good shoeing over Brexit whenever they see each other, most recently at Christmas. “We have so little time together as a family anyway, it seems a shame to focus on the things we don’t agree on,” Letitia says. Tony, 70, agrees: “I would never actually fall out with family or friends about it. You shrug your shoulders and get on with it.” He and his daughter share an inability to take themselves too seriously, and clearly love each other very much.Yet we all have to live together on these little islands, so how can we begin to find a way forward? What strategies are people using to address conflict with loved ones?Laughing about it has helped James, 32, from Maidstone, defuse conflicts that arose as a result of his leave vote. Most of his friends voted to remain. “It’s usually in the pub. Some of them take it personally, like I’ve attacked their sense of being, when I really haven’t. I decided to vote that way because I didn’t think there was any accountability in Europe,” he says. He found social media especially hard. “I was called an idiot, a racist, and accused of not knowing what I’m talking about. I don’t mind if you disagree with me, but it was the language used.”Then, about a year ago, a girl he had been talking to on a dating app ghosted him because he had voted leave. “All my friends, even my remainer friends, found it hilarious. That sort of brought us together. You get some perspective, realise that politics isn’t the be-all and end-all,” he says. James says the election did momentarily reignite tensions. “Now, when I go out with friends, we have a no-politics rule. It has got a lot better. They have been a lot less argumentative now that Brexit has happened.”Olivia Whelan, 38, from London, has reached the “resignation” phase: “I can’t have the same argument over and over with people.” Having studied in Germany and worked there for a decade, she was dismayed by the result and by the fact that her parents – who had lived in Spain for seven years – voted to leave. “When I found out, I was very upset. I found it very difficult for that whole first year to talk about anything else, especially with my dad, who had told my mum how to vote.”But she has come to understand her parents’ reasons for voting leave. “They really did think there would be that £350m a week for the NHS.” She is now, “amazingly”, dating a man who voted leave, which she says would have been unthinkable 18 months ago. They first went on a date in 2017, but ended up screaming at each other about Brexit. “I felt quite sad. I was still so angry and all I could see was that, if you voted for that, you must be terrible, your politics must be terrible, you must hate this country. I couldn’t see past it at all.”Has Olivia been through a grieving process of sorts, and come out the other side? “Yes, life has to go on. We have to find a way to live together after this.” Whether the harmony with her parents and her partner will continue, she doesn’t know. It depends what happens politically. “It’s calm at the moment, but if things get hairy again, I’m going to find it quite difficult.”Alison, 75, a British citizen who lives in Portugal, doesn’t know anyone else in her community of expats who voted to leave and, while her husband didn’t vote, he was pro-remain. “I was subjected to a constant barrage of criticism,” she says. “I frequently felt bullied, sidelined and isolated. I love Europe. I’ve always travelled in Europe. It’s the EU I don’t like.”Things have calmed down a little since the election, but it is clear from talking to Alison that she is still hurt. “I can stand up for myself and make my reasons known. But if you’re totally alone in that argument with no support from anybody else, it’s intimidating.”What about her husband? “We argue every time we watch the news,” she sighs. “You can’t orce your husband because of different political views. We’re fine.” It doesn’t sound fine – how does she think things will progress? “I’m not sure. We’re in a bit of a limbo at the moment. I think more war could break out.”There’s something particularly British about many of the stories I heard from families trying to resolve Brexit conflict, after a callout on the  website. Many of them were simply burying it. Does banning politics as a conversation topic simply repress negative emotions until a later date? Or does it allow people the time and space to focus on what unites them?One person struggling with a politics moratorium is James Turner, 41, from Buckinghamshire. James, who voted remain, and his family live close to his wife’s parents and siblings, and their families, who all voted leave. Brexit sparked conversations that shook his understanding of the people he thought he knew. “I couldn’t believe how emotional I found it,” he says. “When that leaks into family dynamics, it’s really hard.”A lack of communication following several disagreements has left James second-guessing his own feelings. “It occurred to me that it might not even be an issue to them, they might not have even realised how much it has affected me,” he says. This isn’t simply a difference of opinion, though, but extreme right ideologies. What would help James move forward? “Just a conversation that would go a long way to making me feel better about it. I’ve tried so hard to make that happen. But everyone seems terrified of engaging.”Ana, 43, lives in London, and is Spanish-Italian. She has lived in the UK since she was 15, when her anglophile parents sent her to study. She stayed, marrying a Briton who had been raised in Spain, and they have two children, aged eight and 12. When her mother-in-law and husband voted for Brexit, she felt betrayed. “I feel Brexit has been a validation for people expressing anti-immigration feelings,” she says. Pete, 37, who is British and lives in Germany, wept at the Brexit result – voted for by both his parents and their respective partners. It sent him down a long and stressful path towards German citizenship. He became snappy and withdrawn with his mother. “I resented her for what I saw as her supporting people who were working against my way of life, causing chaos for my friends and family, and stripping people in Britain and in the EU of important rights,” he says. What helped was channelling his energy into remain causes and working on his own responses. “I have made personal efforts to change my thinking, and I have the impression she has, too. I am lucky that both my parents are still here, and I want to have enjoyable times with them, and appreciate the good things about our relationship.”Simon, 48, from Solihull, was the first in his family to go to university. He voted remain. He told me how his Brexit-voting father had called him a “liberal elite” and he had called his father “a fucking stupid builder” during years of beer-fuelled arguments in the pub. “For a while, I was using all the hard data. I’d print out arguments with experts and statistics. He’d look at them, but it took me years to realise that it wasn’t the data that was going to change his mind. He hadn’t used reason to get to that position he just wanted out.”What was a logical question to him, Simon realised, was an emotional one for his dad. “It became clear that we were on different wavelengths. If your criteria are completely different then you could be speaking a different language.” But, Simon says, it would never have got to the point where father and son stopped speaking.When Simon wrote to me in January, his father was very ill he died before the month was out. Despite their political differences, the men were close. “As I used to say, ‘Dad, you are a complete arse but I love you.’ Him being ill crystallised the whole thing: some things are more important than politics. Ultimately, this is just an argument in the pub – it’s not going to change how we feel about each other.”Some names have been changedWe tend to make presumptions about the wider set of values other people hold on the basis of one or two that are salient. This is particularly evident post-Brexit. People assume that a person’s stance on Europe is a reliable indicator of all sorts of other values, often negative. Healing requires recognising the complexity of our value systems, and that holding a single view you find intolerable is consistent with holding any number of other values you share.Julian BagginiI usually prefer to avoid seeing a orce as a place where you win or lose. As a lawyer who deals with matters involving a high level of emotions, my number one priority is to keep my clients focused on the desired outcome, instead of seeking cheap wins and ego boosts. In the context of Brexit, the comparison should be that of a orce with children, where the best interest of the child should always come first. It is my job to help people see beyond the emotional hurt and seek common groun1d on which to build a future for themselves, unburdened by past hurts, as well as for their children. With Brexit, things are similar: accepting the new reality, and finding common ground with those who have chosen a different path to the one we would have preferred, is the only way forward.Rakhi SingalIf you’ve fallen out with someone over your views on Brexit, and want to get your relationship back on track, talk – ideally face-to-face. Say you know you have had your differences recently, but you’re still familyfriendspartners and your relationship is important to you. You don’t have to come round to their way of thinking, but you will need to agree to disagree and draw a line under it. If the other person is ready to move forward, try talking through some of the things that you do agree on, and looking back at some of the good times you’ve shared. Keep in mind that you are two different people with unique perspectives – it’s just that the polarisation around Brexit has made these differences more visible. Difference can be a good thing – it’s how you manage it that counts.Peter Saddington, at RelateGet perspective: trying to understand where someone else is coming from is tough but helpful. Try to see things through their lens. If you can understand their starting point, you will be in a better position to come up with solutions that give them some of what they want. This is critical to being able to move forward – if you are offering them nothing, don’t expect them to agree. Learn what triggers negative reactions in you – is there a specific point of disagreement that winds you up? Whatever it is, identify it and practise staying calm when thinking about it, or experiencing it.

They derived their power from the trick of collapsing time and space. In his classic 1983 book Time and the Other, Amsterdam-based anthropologist Johannes Fabian described how this illusion operated. It was as if the further the colonial explorer travelled from the metropolis, the further back in time they went – until they found themselves, whether in Africa, Tasmania, or Tierra del Fuego, no longer in the present, but in the Stone Age.Anthropology museums – which hold “world culture” collections – first developed in Europe, especially Germany and Britain, in the late 19th century. They were designed to realise these exoticising time-warps. In these places, the racist ideologies that sought to justify and naturalise European imperialism were institutionalised, helping create the idea of a distinction between “primitive art” and “civilisation”. Today the colonial mindset of European anthropology museums is being questioned and rethought – and we should all be paying attention.In the quiet Brussels suburb of Tervuren, the Royal Museum for Central Africa reopened in December 2018 after a five-year renovation. Originally built in 1897 to showcase the personal collection of King Leopold II from his private colony Congo Free State, the museum displays stuffed animals and geological specimens alongside African art. Its gardens once housed a short-lived “human zoo” of more than 260 Congolese people. New museum texts attempt to communicate Belgian colonial history and the circumstances in which objects were taken.But this “decolonised” redisplay is both a failure and a cautionary tale. No matter how fully and honestly the story of the Belgian Congo – in which millions of people were killed – is told, the very presence of these objects and the building does what it was designed to do: extend racist ideology and colonial violence through the objectification of Africans. Europe’s museums, as Sumaya Kassim puts it, “will not be decolonised”.The contrast with Senegal’s new $35m Museum of Black Civilisations, which opened to the public in the same month as Tervuren, is stark. As its director, Hamady Bokoum, has explained, the museum is not about ethnology or the past conjured by a European model of museums, but about duration, the future, youth and Africa “looking at itself”, not gazed at by Europeans. An American colleague recently back from Dakar complained that some of the gallery displays seemed “sparse” and “unfinished”. She was not wrong. Across Africa, from Dakar to the new Royal Museum in Benin City in Nigeria, which David Adjaye has been commissioned to design, modern spaces for the display and care for African art and cultural heritage are being constructed hand-in-hand with renewed calls for the return of plundered objects.Last year, the 15 nations of the Economic Community of West African States agreed an action plan for the return of African cultural property, and in February 2020 13 African heads of state convened as part of a new strategic group to champion 2021 as a Year of Culture for Africa, and “to speed up the return of cultural assets”. African institutions are reimagining museums not as an endpoint but as an ongoing, living process.This new African thinking challenges Europe to look at itself through its own “unfinished” anthropology museums. Foremost is the question of cultural restitution and the return of sacred, royal and culturally iconic artworks and material culture taken under colonialism. In Britain, our tired and familiar national narrative conflates returning the Parthenon marbles, Easter Island statues, the Rosetta Stone, the Benin Bronzes and even the Lewis chessmen into one intractable issue. By contrast, Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy’s report on restitution, commissioned by Emmanuel Macron in France, calls for us to distinguish between the different circumstances of “acquisition” – from violent looting to colonial collecting, archaeological fieldwork and even purchase – in which questions of “consent” and “duress” are relevant. Times are changing for Europe’s “world culture” museums. How can they participate in this global present, rather than just representing some old colonial vision? We must let go of our old obsessions with cultural ownership and the spectre of “empty galleries” (a common refrain from those who defend the status quo and envisage western museums stripped of their collections if restitution requests are granted). It is time to reimagine museums as sites of conscience – unique public spaces for understanding, remembering and addressing the legacies of empire and enduring cultural infrastructure of “race science” – for the restitution of knowledge and memory as well as of property.The recent revival of eugenics at the heart of Britain’s political conversation is a wake-up call. Far from just places for retelling the history of empire through world culture collections, in the old contemplative mode, museums are unfinished projects, and crucial resources to be rethought and repurposed for the wider, urgent European task of understanding and facing up to the violence and loss wrought by colonialism.• Dan Hicks is professor of contemporary archeology at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming The Brutish Museums"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7af1fbe289375015d352f226b9ce96ac61c232/134_0_3743_2246/master/3743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4220feac7ad8713f54ffdacef2c8811","title":"coronavirus live updates australia sick doctor us cruise ship cases mike pence","story":"Twenty one cases reported on ship off San Francisco as leader of Italy’s Democratic party tests positiveA former passenger of the Diamond Princess cruise ship who was infected with coronavirus has died, bringing the death toll from the ship to seven, Japanese public broadcaster NHK has said.The passenger, a non-Japanese male, died on Friday, according to Reuters.US president Donald Trump remarks that he would prefer if passengers on the coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship were not allowed to come onto US soil.France has reported another jump in coronavirus cases from 653 to 716, an increase of 63, according to the French health ministry. The spokesperson said that 11 people had now died in France because of the virus. The pope will make Sunday blessings via a streaming service from inside the Vatican, instead of appearing in person in St Peter’s Square, in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The pope’s general audiences are also to be streamed and no participants at papal morning masses are to be allowed until March 15, Reuters reports.The measures are being put in place to protect worshippers and the pope from infection. The pope has been suffering from a cold. As Greece steps up measures to contain an outbreak of coronavirus in the west of the country, there is growing concern over the stance of Greek Orthodox clerics, who have refused to postpone church services and suspend Christian rites. Although the Holy Synod, the church’s ruling body, has endorsed many of the preventative measures, it has steadfastly rejected calls for practices such as holy communion to be halted. To the alarm of scientists, high-ranking bishops have invoked religious belief as a bulwark again Covid-19. In extraordinary exchanges on TV, clerics have argued that sacraments such as the holy eucharist should remain off-limits because they are God-given. “Whoever believes that holy communion and the church are life has nothing to fear,” the Bishop of Patras, Chrysostomos, told Open News. “There has been no case, anywhere, of a virus or any other illness being transmitted through holy communion.” Prominent virologists in the country have also come out in support of the powerful religious institution. One well-known professor of infectious diseases said that while people aged 65 and over with underlying health issues would be better off avoiding church, she belonged to those who would still attend services, which in Greece are often held in crowded chapels. “When you go to take holy communion, you don’t take it out of habit but because it tis he body and blood of Christ,” Eleni Giamarellou, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Athens, told local media. “Those who want to take the sacraments should not fear that germs could be transmitted through holy communion.” The stance has raised fears of further transmissions in a country where cases of coronavirus rose from eight on Monday to 46 today. Another leading epidemiologist has weighed in on the drop in cases in Hubei province, and what this might mean for the rest of the world. Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said it was a source of hope that China was currently seeing a substantial reduction in cases.“However, there are still unanswered questions, for example about the total number of infections and even how protected previously recovered people are from new infections, before we can give confident descriptions on how to contain the disease,” he said. “I would like to see detailed, population-based (as opposed to clinic-based) serological investigations to be conducted. This would allow an inidual’s history of the disease, including inapparent (or asymptomatic) cases, to be evaluated. And this needs to be done in large areas where cases have been reported, in order to find out how many cases were missed by the surveillance programs.”Hibberd added that such data could enable a more accurate analysis of the disease’s severity following infection, “in a similar way to how we are able to calculate this for Influenza”.He warned governments around the globe to get the balance in their response to the outbreak, by adequately contributing to the world’s attempts to delay the spread of coronavirus, while simultaneously “keeping their economies running as well as possible”, instead of “putting too much of their health care resources into Covid-19”. A 26-year old woman returning from London has tested positive for coronavirus in Vietnam, after the country went 22 days with no new infections.The Vietnamese woman, the country’s 17th case in total, has been quarantined and is undergoing treatment, the Vietnamese news outlet VN Express reported. Authorities said the patient had left Hanoi’s Noi Bai airport on 15 February to visit family members living in London. Three days later, she travelled from London to Milan City, in the province of Lombardy, Italy, and returned to London on 20 February. On 25 February, the woman travelled from London to Paris to visit her sister. She contracted a cough on 29 February, but did not see a doctor.On 1 March, she reportedly felt body pain and fatigue, but it was unclear if she had a fever. The same day, she boarded a flight from London and landed in Hanoi on 2 March. As Vietnamese authorities held an emergency meeting about the case, and 17 doctors who had been in contact with the woman were being isolated, Public Health England said it could not comment on inidual situations. Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of Italy’s Democratic party (PD), which governs the country in coalition with the Five Star Movement (M5S), has tested positive for coronavirus.“Doctors told me I have tested positive,’’ Zingaretti announced on Facebook. “But I’m fine and I will stay home for the next few days. From here, I will continue to follow the work that needs to be done.” Authorities in the US are preparing to test passengers on the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Grand Princess, after 21 people on board tested positive for the illness.Some 140 Britons are among those on board. US vice-president, Mike Pence, said on Friday that the Grand Princess, currently carrying more than 3,500 people, had been directed to a non-commercial port for testing, PA Media reports. So far 45 people on board the ship off the Californian coast have been tested, with 19 of those diagnosed with the virus being crew members.Lisa Egan, whose 90-year-old father is on board, called for the ship to be evacuated. “Keeping people on board is going to be a death sentence for many,” she told the  newspaper.Donald Trump appeared to suggest he wanted to see the ship remain off the coast to keep country’s infection numbers down.An infectious disease specialist has warned against mass panic and stockpiling as Covid-19 infections continue to spread across the world.Abdu Sharkawy of the University of Toronto’s Division of Infectious Disease wrote on Facebook that he was not scared of the virus, but feared the implications of people’s egoism, which could result in a mass panic.What I am scared about is the loss of reason and wave of fear that has induced the masses of society into a spellbinding spiral of panic, stockpiling obscene quantities of anything that could fill a bomb shelter adequately in a post-apocalyptic world. I am scared of the N95 masks that are stolen from hospitals and urgent care clinics where they are actually needed for front line healthcare providers and instead are being donned in airports, malls, and coffee lounges, perpetuating even more fear and suspicion of others. I am scared that our hospitals will be overwhelmed with anyone who thinks they ‘probably don’t have it but may as well get checked out no matter what because you just never know...’ and those with heart failure, emphysema, pneumonia and strokes will pay the price for overfilled ER waiting rooms with only so many doctors and nurses to assess.He added that he was scared about far reaching travel restrictions impacting communities harshly, and about “epidemic fears” limiting trade in multiple sectors.But mostly he was scared of the message children were told in this crisis. Instead of reason, rationality, openmindedness and altruism, we are telling them to panic, be fearful, suspicious, reactionary and self-interested.The fact is the virus itself will not likely do much harm when it arrives. But our own behaviors and ‘fight for yourself above all else’ attitude could prove disastrous.Lorenzo Tondo in PalermoItaly is considering setting up new quarantine red zones in northern regions amid increasing numbers of coronavirus cases, as the country grapples to contain Europe’s worst outbreak of Covid-19 which had claimed 197 lives by Saturday.Authorities are also considering locking down the entire region of Lombardy.Rome has announced it is making €600m available to hire 20,000 new health professionals to cope with the emergency.The government is evaluating the possibility of prolonging the closure of schools until 3 April.Some 3,916 people are now infected, 620 more than Thursday, the emergency commissioner and civil protection chief Angelo Borrelli said on Friday.A cruise ship on the Nile in Egypt with more than 150 tourists and local crew was in quarantine on Saturday in the southern city of Luxor, after 12 people tested positive for coronavirus.A Taiwanese-American tourist who had previously been on the same ship tested positive when she returned to Taiwan.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4196481.1583586977!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus some irish embassies cancel st patrick s day receptions","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            An emergency department nurse during a demonstration of the Coronavirus pod and COVID-19 virus testing procedures set-up beside the Emergency Department of Antrim Area Hospital, Co Antrim in Northern Ireland.

Photograph: Jack CahillA number of Irish embassies have cancelled their planned St Patrick’s Day receptions due to the coronavirus outbreak.Cancellation notices were sent out to invited guests by Ireland’s embassies in France and Switzerland and by the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in Geneva on Friday.“In light of the evolving Covid-19 situation, and having consulted the relevant authorities, we have decided to cancel our St Patrick’s Day reception,” the Irish Ambassador in Switzerland Eamon Hickey wrote to guests.Ireland’s flagship event on the diplomatic calendar is the latest to fall victim to the outbreak, which has forced the cancellation of mass business, cultural and sporting events across Europe. The outbreak has hit economies as people cancel plans to travel and socialise, and taken a heavy toll on Chinese manufacturing which has hit supply chains.“We have had no option but to cancel,” wrote the Ambassador Michael Gaffey of the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in Geneva.“I would hope that we will be in a position to re-organise the event in a few months, but obviously this will depend on the evolution of the situation.”The cancellation notice by the Irish Embassy to France said the St Patrick’s Day reception was being called off due to “current circumstances”, without specifying the disease.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe had been due to visit Paris for St Patrick’s Day events. He is one of nine members of Government due to be dispatched across Europe and the United States for the occasion.The Department of Foreign Affairs did not give a figure on how many St Patrick’s Day events would be cancelled, but said decisions would be taken on a case by case basis.“St Patrick’s Day receptions cancelled are local decisions made by the Embassy in consultation with local authorities and local Irish communities,” a spokesman said.The Government has said there are no plans as yet to cancel St Patrick’s Day events in Ireland. However, organisers of St Patrick’s Day parades in the Co Cork towns of Youghal, Cobh and Midleton have announced they will cancel their event this year. EffortsMeanwhile, efforts are continuing across the State to curb the spread of the coronavirus following news that the number of confirmed Irish cases had risen to 18. Five new cases of the virus were confirmed on Friday – three in the south of the county, one in the east and one in the west. One case is associated with travel from northern Italy, and one with close contact with a confirmed case. A third case involves a healthcare worker who was in close contact with a confirmed case.The last two new cases involve a male who travelled from abroad and a female who travelled from northern Italy. The country the man travelled to Ireland from is not one of the high-risk areas and the case remains under investigation.The State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan described 18 as “a small number of cases” and pointed out that the origins of all but one could be explained.“We are still in a containment phase and the chance of picking up this disease remains very low.”More than 102,100 people worldwide have now been infected with the virus and nearly 3,500 people have died. The disease has been detected in 89 countries with China, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Japan the worst affected areas. Germany, France, Spain and the United States have also see their number of positive cases rise rapidly in recent days. TestingIt’s expected staff at some Irish hospitals will be trained to provide testing facilities regionally with the National Virus Reference Laboratory in University College Dublin currently processing all tests. The National Maternity Hospital on Dublin’s Holles Street said it had applied visitor restrictions due to concerns about the potential spread of the virus. “The only visiting permitted is the birth partner of the pregnant woman or mother attending (no childen) \u0026amp the parents of a baby in NICU unless exceptional circumstances,” the hospital said in Twitter post on Saturday.Hospitals in Cork and the midwest, and Dublin’s Mater hospital, where cases are being treated, have also introduced visitor restrictions and many elective surgeries have been cancelled. Private nursing homes across the State have also restricted visiting to minimise risk to “vulnerable” older residents.Information notices are being distributed to direct provision centres around the country with details of “good respiratory and hygiene practices”, a spokesman for the department of justice has said. These notices, which are being translated into different languages, are being made available in all accommodation centres which includes emergency beds in B\u0026ampBs and hotels. However, fears have been voiced on Twitter that the cramped, overcrowded conditions of some accommodation centres could result in the virus rapidly spreading among groups of asylum seekers. Daily risk assessments are also being conducted and “any changing circumstances are responded to effectively”, said the department spokesman. “In accordance with best practice, contingency planning is also in hand to address any issues arising in the centres, should circumstances change”, he added. Confirmed caseTrinity College Dublin, which has one confirmed case among its student body, introduced a ban on Friday evening on any staff or student entering the university for 14 days after returning from a high-risk area. At present, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Iran, Japan and four provinces of northern Italy are designated as high risk by the HSE. Queen’s University Belfast is also operating as normal after a member of the college community tested positive for the virus earlier this week.Starbucks announced on Friday that it had stopped accepting reusable cups from customers to prevent the spread of the virus but that it would still honour the promised discount for anyone carrying one. Drinks will be served in paper cups, the company said.It’s understood a number of Irish-based coffee shops are following suit and refusing to serve drinks in reusable cups.

The National Virus Reference Laboratory in University College Dublin currently processes all tests. Up to last week, almost 400 people had been tested, but this number is expected to have risen sharply when new figures are published early next week.Other health service staff are to be drafted in to assist the 60 or so public health professionals who specialise in tracing contacts of people with infectious diseases. The requirement for contact tracing has escalated hugely since the number of cases grew in recent days.Three of the new cases in the Republic are in the south of the country, one is in the east and one in the west.One case is associated with travel from northern Italy, and one with close contact with a confirmed case. A third case involves a healthcare worker who was in close contact with a confirmed case.The last two new cases involve a male who travelled from abroad and a female who travelled from northern Italy. The country the man travelled to Ireland from is not one of the high-risk areas and the case remains under investigation.Containment phaseThe State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan described 18 as “a small number of cases” and pointed out that the origins of all but one could be explained.“We are still in a containment phase and the chance of picking up this disease remains very low.”Hospitals in Cork and the midwest, and Dublin’s Mater hospital, where cases are being treated, have introduced visitor restrictions and many elective surgeries have been cancelled. Private nursing homes across the State have also restricted visiting to minimise risk to “vulnerable” older residents.Trinity College Dublin, which has one confirmed case among its student body, has introduced a ban on entering the college for 14 days for staff and students returning from northern Italy or other high-risk areas.Ireland’s fifth round Six Nations clash away to France on March 14th will go ahead, the French Rugby Federation confirmed. Organisers of the St Patrick’s Day parade in Youghal, Co Cork announced their decision to cancel this year’s event.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar urged people “not to act unilaterally, whether that is crèche owners or business owners or event organisers”. “We need to act in concert, and if the response needs to be escalated we should escalate it altogether.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4196500.1583586173!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no current case for united ireland border poll alliance party","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere is no current case for a Border poll on a united Ireland, Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said at the party’s 50th anniversary annual conference.  File Photograph: HOPRUAFP via Getty ImagesThere is no current case for a Border poll on a united Ireland but there is space for a “civilised, rational and evidence-based discussions” on the issue, Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said at the party’s 50th anniversary annual conference.Dr Farry when addressing up to 400 delegates at the conference at the Stormont Hotel in east Belfast on Saturday said that Alliance recognised that Brexit and other factors have energised the debate around the constitutional question.“Given the nature of Alliance, some may suggest that this would be a particular challenge. But on the contrary, these are debates that in which we can engage with confidence,” said the North Down MP.Dr Farry ended up delivering the conference’s keynote speech as party leader Naomi Long was unable to attend due to a chest infection.A party spokesman said that Dr Farry’s speech also contained input from the Alliance leader. He also explained that her illness was not coronavirus.“Alliance is not a party that is defined by the constitutional question,” said Dr Farry. “While there may be some members who prefer the union, and some who prefer a united Ireland and indeed many who are open to persuasion, we are not only united, but defined, by our shared commitment to make this society work, to overcome ision and to build a better future.”Border poll“We don’t believe that there is currently the case for a Border poll, and nor are we pursuing one, but we do recognise that there is a very fluid situation and multiple active debates are underway,” he added.“We can with confidence, and without prejudice to any outcome, engage in civilised, rational and evidence-based discussions. In all respects, we will be guided by our vision and values and always advocate what we think is right for Northern Ireland. ”Dr Farry was addressing the conference after local, European and Westminster elections last year which saw the “Alliance surge” and the party’s overall vote more than doubling from 8 per cent in 2017 to 17 per cent in 2019.Analysing that success Dr Farry said that “for starters” more and more people were moving away from traditional labels, and expressing open, mixed and multiple identities.He added, “Second, we called Brexit correctly, right from the start, and have been consistent throughout. We have clearly articulated and defended Northern Ireland’s interests.“Third, we have channelled frustrations around the politics of deadlock and delay, and the desire to see change, reform and delivery. Success has bred further success.”Dr Farry said the “old canard” of a vote for Alliance being a wasted vote had been shattered. “We have proven that we can win anywhere in Northern Ireland. And we have drawn votes from right across the community. We have proven that in a political context usually framed around the constitutional question and a clash of identities that a liberal and cross community party can not only survive but flourish.”Dr Farry reaffirmed the party’s commitment to Europe and the European Union. “We should look forward and aspire to Northern Ireland rejoining the EU sooner rather than later,” he said.“But for now, Boris Johnson is set to pursue a reckless hard Brexit. The Brexit extremists exhibit the characteristics of revolutionaries, in this case fuelled by a libertarian ideology and wishful, delusional thinking. Dissenting voices are labelled as enemies of the people,” he added.Neighbours“The UK is turning its back on is biggest and most important neighbours for the pipe dream of a global Britain, all the time failing to acknowledge that it is through the EU that the UK can best project soft power and expand international trade.”Dr Farry said that the British government appeared determined to turn its back on international human rights standards and that British prime minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal risked “leaving Northern Ireland in a ‘No Man’s Land’, with the Good Friday agreement undermined and a renewed risk of the return of a hard border on this island”.“It is not in our interests to have a cowboy economy,” he added.Dr Farry said the recent New Decade, New Approach deal that restored Stormont was not perfect but was a “necessary starting point” to make politics work.He called for a reform of Assembly veto system, the petition of concern a change of the designation system at Stormont where politicians identify as unionist, nationalist or “other”, which is Alliance’s designation and reform of the North’s finances.And referring to the absent leader Dr Farry said that Naomi Long as Minister of Justice would work for victims of domestic, sexual and other abuse introduce a stalking Bill and “lead a cross-departmental approach to stamp out paramilitary control of communities, build a culture of lawfulness and confidence in the entire justice system and create safe, shared communities”.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Regional sources see move by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as effort to consolidate powerBrussels condemns Ankara use of migrants for \u0026lsquopolitical purposes\u0026rsquo at Greek-Turkish borderClashes between Syrian army and jihadis puncture uneasy truce after Putin-Erdogan dealTurkish-backed jihadis and insurgents based in Idlib squeezed into a reduced areaErdogan and Putin reach agreement on Syria after six hours of talks in MoscowPresident Erdogan to meet Russian counterpart Putin for talks in MoscowPrime minister\u0026rsquos Likud party needs support of 61 Knesset members to reach majorityExit polls leave his Likud party only one seat short of an overall Knesset majorityBardarash Letter: Camp\u0026rsquos occupants struggle on after having lost everythingOpen border sees Greece struggle with thousands of migrantsGhani says Trump had not asked for release of prisoners as part of peace deal talksTurkish president agrees to reduce tensions in region following consultation with PutinChances look slim that either Netanyahu or Gantz will be able to form governmentSyria warns it will take down any planes, drones breaching air space over northwestWashington will withdraw all troops from country within 14 months if Taliban upholds commitmentsRussia says two sides agreed to reduce tensions in Idlib while continuing military action thereWith the two main groups more or less remaining tied a fourth election cannot be ruled outTurkish call for Idlib no-fly zone not seriously discussed as fears of clash with Russia growMove comes day after 33 Turkish soldiers killed in attack in Syrian province of IdlibWomen still must obtain permission to marry, orce and seek shelter from domestic abuseStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4196490.1583582225!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"saudi arabia detains three senior royals for allegedly planning coup","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Reports suggest  that Saudi officials have arrested members of the royal family for allegedly plotting a coup. File photograph: Pavel GolovkinAP.Saudi Arabian authorities have detained three senior princes including Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, the younger brother of King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the king’s nephew, for allegedly planning a coup, sources said.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, King Salman’s son and de facto ruler of the country, which is the world’s top oil exporter and a key US ally, has moved to consolidate power since ousting Mohammed bin Nayef as heir to the throne in a 2017 palace coup.Later that year, he arrested several royals and other prominent Saudis, holding them for months at Riyadh’s Ritz Carlton hotel, in an anti-corruption campaign that caused shockwaves at home and abroad.Four sources said that Prince Ahmed and Mohammed bin Nayef were detained in the latest operation. Two sources, including a regional source, said Mohammed bin Nayef and his half-brother, Nawaf, were detained while at a private desert camp on Friday.Crown Prince Mohammed, who is also referred to as MbS, “accused them (the princes) of conducting contacts with foreign powers, including the Americans and others, to carry out a coup d’etat,” the source said.“With these arrests, MbS consolidated his full grip on power. It’s over with this purge,” the source added, indicating that no rivals remain to challenge his succession to the throne. Another source said the princes were accused of “treason”.The Saudi government media office did not respond to a request for comment on the detentions, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.ApprovedThe regional source said King Salman had approved the latest detentions. “The king signed off on the arrests,” the source said, adding that the king is in a mental and physically sound state.The king met British foreign secretary Dominic Raab on Thursday in the Saudi capital Riyadh. Both King Salman and the crown prince attended a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.Crown Prince Mohammed (34) has fuelled resentment among some prominent branches of the ruling family by tightening his grip on power. Some critics have questioned his ability to lead after the 2018 murder of a prominent journalist by Saudi agents and the largest-ever attack on Saudi oil infrastructure last year.The source said royals seeking to change the line of succession view Prince Ahmed, King Salman’s only surviving full brother, as a possible choice who would have support of family members, the security apparatus, and some Western powers.Saudi authorities have not commented on issues of succession or criticism of the crown prince’s leadership. Prince Mohammed is popular among Saudi youth and also has staunch supporters within the royal Al Saud family, which numbers around 10,000 members.Saudi insiders and Western diplomats say the family is unlikely to oppose the crown prince while the 84-year-old king remains alive, saying the monarch is unlikely to turn against his favourite son, to whom he has delegated most responsibilities of rule.Low profilePrince Ahmed has largely kept a low profile since returning to Riyadh in October 2018 after 2½ months abroad and Saudi watchers have said there is no evidence he is willing to take the throne. During that trip abroad, he appeared to criticise the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty.Ahmed was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling Al Saud family’s senior members, who opposed Mohammed bin Salman becoming crown prince in 2017, sources said. Mohammed bin Nayef’s movements have been restricted and monitored since then.The latest detentions come at a time of heightened tension with rival Iran and as the crown prince implements social and economic reforms, including an initial public offering by oil giant Saudi Aramco on the domestic bourse last December. Saudi Arabia is also the current chair for the Group of 20 major economies.The crown prince has been lauded at home for easing social restrictions in the conservative Muslim kingdom and trying to ersify the economy away from oil. But he has come under international criticism over a devastating war in Yemen, the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate, and the detention of women’s rights activists seen as part of a crackdown on dissent. - ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195320.1583511822!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"campaigning rules of thumb rewritten by democratic nominees","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders: With the primary field effectively down to two, focus now turns to the battle ahead. Photographs: Mark Felix and Mark Ralston After more than a year of uneven debate performances, inconsistent polling and a historically large field of candidates, America finally got some clarity this week as to who will be the Democratic nominee to face Donald Trump in November.The remarkable political comeback of Joe Biden saw the former vice-president catch the only other remaining contender, Bernie Sanders, who had clocked up victories in most of February’s primaries. Biden’s revival began a week ago in South Carolina. Having channelled his dwindling resources and time into the first southern state to vote, Biden won big, securing almost half the vote. Within 48 hours a cascade of endorsements followed as rivals like Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg fell by the wayside and lined up behind Biden. He then secured a better-than-expected victory on Super Tuesday, winning 10 of the 14 states. Sanders is still a formidable opponent, and is expected to sweep up most of California’s delegates when counting in the largest state finally ends.The dramatic events of the last week have renewed focus on the process of choosing an American presidential nominee. They have also turned a number of political truisms on their head. Is a good ground campaign necessary at state level? Not necessarily. Biden notched up surprise victories on Tuesday in states he did not even visit and where he had virtually no campaign infrastructure, such as Massachusetts and Minnesota. So much for the oft-cited argument that Hillary Clinton lost Wisconsin to Trump in 2016 in part because she never visited the midwestern state.\u0026nbspIowa’s prominenceDoes money talk in US politics? Not every time. Bloomberg found out the hard way that $500 million in advertising spending could only really buy him the pacific island of American Samoa, the only territory to vote for him, though he picked up some delegates in other states.But as analysts ponder the reasons for Biden’s resurrection, there are also questions for the Democratic National Committee. Serious consideration should be given to the continued prominence of Iowa and the other early voting states in the primary system.\u0026nbsp There has long been an argument that Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold their contests first, play too much of a role in the selection process. As overwhelmingly white and rural states, they do not represent the demographics of America, and more specifically the make-up of the Democratic electorate. The fiasco over the Iowa caucus, which saw results delayed for several days, also furthered calls to reassess the system – while also arguably depriving the winner, Pete Buttigieg, of the media coverage boost that typically accompanies an Iowa victory, given the focus on the voting debacle.The fact that Biden finished fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire also undermined the conventional political thinking that a strong showing in these early voting states is essential to secure the momentum needed for the rest of the contest. The Biden argument that he would do better in more racially erse states played out.Gaining groundThe Democratic Party needs to also examine how two white men in their late 70s have emerged as the frontrunners, given the ersity of the Democratic electorate.With the primary field effectively down to two, focus now turns to the battle ahead. Sanders faces a crucial few weeks as he takes on Biden and the bulk of the Democratic establishment who have backed him. The next states to hold primaries are naturally less friendly territory for Sanders, while the youth vote on which he was banking has failed to turn out in big numbers so far. A key state to watch will be Michigan, one of four states voting next Tuesday. Sanders had been leading there in recent weeks, but polls suggest that Biden is gaining ground.Biden too faces a myriad of challenges. His shortcomings have not gone away, and it will be interesting to see how he performs in the next TV debate in just over a week’s time. His campaign is also way behind Sanders in terms of ground organisation and digital advertising, so he will be hoping to inherit not only some of Bloomberg’s campaign money, but also his impressive campaign infrastructure, including in the field of internet advertising.With the candidates neck-and-neck in terms of delegates, the race is too close to call. But the packed primary calendar suggests we could have a good sense of who will be the nominee by the end of this month.Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4196486.1583583070!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus irish people among those stranded on cruise ship off us coast","story":"President Donald Trump has said  he would rather have passengers on a cruise ship, which was denied entry to San Francisco over coronavirus concerns, remain on the Grand Princess. There are a small number of Irish people  on board the vessel. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAirmen from the  129th Rescue Wing deliver coronavirus test-kits to the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California. Photograph: US Coast GuardHandout via Reuters.A small number of Irish people people are on board a coronavirus-hit cruise ship that is stuck off the coast of California. A total of 21 people on the Grand Princess have so far tested positive for Covid-19, just under half of all those who have been tested. Nineteen of those diagnosed are crew members on the ship, which has more than 3,500 people on board including four Irish people and 140 Britons. A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said: “The consulate in San Francisco is in touch with local authorities and monitoring the situation closely. “It is the department’s policy in providing consular assistance that commentary is not given on inidual cases and the people or families involved.”US vice-president Mike Pence said on Friday that the Grand Princess would be directed to a non-commercial port. Among those onboard is Co Donegal native Pat Kelly, who is the second officer on the cruiser. Mr Kelly is from Moville and only left the town a month ago to return to sea having spent Christmas and the New Year there. He trained at the National Maritime College in Ringaskiddy, Cork.A local source said Mr Kelly has been in touch with his family and friends in Co Donegal to let them now that he is in good health.“He is fine and he has been in touch by phone to reassure his family of that,” the source said.“Pat is young but he is a very experienced seaman and has been at sea all of his life. He has risen through the ranks quickly. This is just another challenge he will take on board and get on with it.”A British passenger on board the ship told BBC Radio 4 that she booked a space on the Grand Princess to mark her 70th birthday. Jackie Bissell, from Dartford in Kent, said passengers were told on Thursday that there might be something wrong.“We had a note popped through the door saying that this virus might be on the ship — they removed the salt, the pepper,” she said. “We could touch absolutely nothing, if you wanted sugar in your tea or coffee they would come along and do it for you rather than you touching any of these items.“You can’t go out, you can just go out in the hall if someone taps the door. They put the food outside, drop your menus inside and that’s about it.”Not too badBut Ms Bissell said life on board “has not been too bad” so far.“It was a bit mish mash yesterday but today they’ve got things a lot more organised,” she said.“We’re very comfortable and everything you need will be brought to you — eventually — and we are absolutely fine and the ship is fine.”Ms Bissell said those on board have been given very little information on what happens next.Fellow passengers Neil and Victoria Hanlon, from Bridgwater in Somerset, Englan, said they had noticed some people looking ill as long as a week ago.“We have passed a few people on the ship about a week ago who did look seriously ill, they had masks and stuff on,” Mr Hanlon told ITV.“We were in the lift with them which probably wasn’t a good thing. They were going down to where the medical centre was. We asked them if they were okay — their breathing was horrendous.”The Grand Princess is owned by Princess Cruises, and a spokesman for the company said on Friday evening that it was “awaiting official specific plans for future positioning of the ship from relevant authorities”.“Princess Cruises will continue to closely follow the guidance of the CDC (Centres for Disease Control) and other federal and state government authorities.”US President Donald Trump appeared to be in favour of leaving the Grand Princess’s passengers where they are — apparently to avoid increasing the nation’s infection total.‘Wasn’t our fault’Speaking at the CDC campus in Atlanta, Georgia, on Friday, Mr Trump said: “I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.”Princess Cruises also owns the Diamond Princess ship which was quarantined off the coast of Japan for several weeks earlier this year.The ship became a breeding ground for the virus as staff continued to carry out their cooking, serving and cleaning duties while the ship was immobile.Around 700 people caught coronavirus while in quarantine, more than a quarter of the 2,600 people on board.The Japanese authorities later admitted the approach was flawed.

However, it is only now - more than 1,300 years after her death and after carbon dating her teeth and bones - that historians believe they have finally identified England’s first abbess and one of the country’s earliest saints.The remarkable discovery was made by Kent archaeologists and historians, working with Queen\u0027s University in Belfast, who confirmed that human remains kept at the Church of St Mary and St Eanswythe Folkestone are almost certainly those of the saint.The discovery has been hailed as “a stunning result of national importance and has drawn comparisons with the exhumation of King Richard III after DNA confirmed that bones found beneath a Leicester car park in 2012 were those of the former king of England.The findings revealed at a special event at the church on Friday evening to mark the start of British Science Week 2020.Dr Andrew Richardson, FSA, from the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, said: This locally-based community partnership has produced a stunning result of national importance.It now looks highly probable that we have the only surviving remains of a member of the Kentish royal house, and of one of the earliest Anglo-Saxon saints.Tooth and bone samples were carbon dated and the results pointed to a high probability of a mid-seventh century death date.The relics mark a period that saw the very beginning of Christianity in England - and signify a continuous Christian witness in Folkestone that stretches from her life to the present day.St Eanswythe’s grandfather King Ethelbert was the first English king to convert to Christianity under Augustine. St Eanswythe is believed to have founded one of the earliest monastic communities in England, most likely around AD 660 on the Bayle - the overlooked historic centre of Folkestone. As well as founding the earliest institution for nuns in England, she was also almost certainly its abbess. In 1535, the church was a priory church which had monks. However following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, relics were destroyed across England. It is thought that St Eanswythe\u0027s skull was handed over by the monks. However the rest of her remains might well have been destroyed in the Reformation - along with those of her contemporaries - had they not been concealed in the north wall of the Folkestone church by the monks.St Eanswythe is the patron saint of Folkestone, and is believed to have founded one of the earliest monastic communities in England, most likely around AD 660 on the Bayle - the overlooked historic centre of the town.St Eanswythe is believed to have died between the ages of 17 to 22, however her cause of death is currently unknown. The discovery represents the conjunction of two projects: The Finding Eanswythe Project and Folkestone Museum.The project has been locally led and run, with many of the specialists and team involved originating from Folkestone or East Kent. The team has been supported by a large number of local colleagues and volunteers and  was funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.The project now needs to raise funds for the next stage of work, which will reveal more about St Eanswythe and to ensure that her remains are housed properly for the future and can be securely displayed for research and tourism purposes.The next analytical steps will include stable isotope analysis and DNA analysis.The Revd Dr Lesley Hardy, director of the Finding Eanswythe project, said: As you walk through the streets of Folkestone, you are walking, layer upon layer, over ancient history that is now largely hidden from view.Finding Eanswythe was about bringing that forgotten history back to the surface.Dr Richardson added: There is more work to be done to realise the full potential of this discovery.But certainly the project represents a wonderful conjunction not only of archaeology and history, but also of a continuous living faith tradition at Folkestone from the mid-seventh century down to the present day.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus uk map where cases","story":"Coronavirus reached Britain in late January, cases have been on the rise since late February and the first death was recorded on March 5.Thousands of people in the UK have been tested for Covid-19, and the government released an emergency action plan to deal with the potential pandemic.It warned up to one in five workers in the UK could be off sick during a coronavirus peak, while the police may switch to only dealing with serious crime.

It is sourced from Public Health England announcements and will be updated regularly based on trustworthy data.On Wednesday, Public Health England confirmed 36 new cases of coronavirus had been detected in the UK.And on Friday the Department for Heath and Social Care said an additional 48 patients had been infected - the largest single day rise to date - bringing the total across the UK to 164. Another death was also reported. Of those located in England, the largest number has been detected in London, with 29 cases recorded in the capital.Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said 29 of the new cases this week had travelled from recognised countries or clusters under investigation.He said three contracted the virus in the UK, but it was not yet clear if they contracted it directly or indirectly from someone returning from abroad. An elderly patient with underlying health conditions was the first person to die in the UK having been diagnosed with coronavirus, according to the Royal Berkshire NHS Trust.A second death was confirmed on Friday.The unnamed patient in his 80s is thought to have succumbed to COVID-19 on Thursday night while being treated at Milton Keynes, Hospital, Bucks.Prof Whitty said all UK cases were being investigated and contact tracing has begun.He told BBC Breakfast there could be a need to do extreme things to protect the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions in the event of a UK epidemic.He said the NHS would cope with a major spread of cases but could come under very high pressure in a large epidemic.He said: For the great majority of people this will be a mild or moderate disease, anything from a sniffle to having to go to bed for a few days rather like with mild flu.And there are some people who will get it with no symptoms at all, but for a minority of people - and this is particular in people who are older people or people with pre-existing health conditions - the risk is higher.The NHS will always cope because the NHS is an emergency service which is very good at adapting to what it finds itself with.But he said if the UK sees a very large epidemic, then it will put very high pressure on the NHS and there could be several weeks which could be very difficult for the health service and wider society.Prof Whitty said he believes there is now onward transmission between people in the UK - which could lead to spiralling numbers - although only two cases of this nature have been identified so far. Mitigation efforts in the UK will be driven by the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011 and fall into four main areas:At the end of December, the Chinese authorities sent out a public alert warning that a pneumonia of unknown cause had been identified in Wuhan, central China.Some 10 days later, on Jan 7, scientists announced that a new coronavirus was the source of the outbreak – quickly adding that it did not appear to be spreading between humans. At that point, fewer than 60 cases had been found. But now the virus, which has since been named Covid-19, has spread to well over 70 countries, infecting more than 93,000 people and killing nearly 3,200. Scientists believe that the virus has mutated into two strains: the older ‘S-type’ appears to be milder and less infectious, while the ‘L-type’ which emerged later, spreads quickly and currently accounts for around 70 per cent of cases. This map, which updates automatically, shows where the disease is now, how many cases there have been and how many people have died: More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/05/TELEMMGLPICT000227008933_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"covid 19 isnt just flu itis time take virus seriously","story":"Italy is shutting its schools and restaurants are desertedPublic libraries are putting away children’s toys. Supermarkets are running low on loo paper. Everywhere, you see the furtive rubbing of hands that indicates the breaking out of sanitising gel (while stocks last). In a somewhat unexpected development, sales of Corona beer have fallen through the floor.Yet still, for the most part, we remain nonchalant. Two American friends visiting recently were astonished to find Londoners going about their business largely as normal. There is even a faint air of contempt here for the drastic measures being taken in some parts of the world. China is welding people into apartment buildings, Italy is shutting its schools and Switzerland is cancelling luxury watch conferences, but we Brits know how to take on a little dose of the flu without so much hoo-ha! This air of confidence is misplaced.There is still a huge amount we don’t know about this new virus. Even the death rate is just an estimate. Taking only confirmed cases – recoveries versus deaths – results in a death rate close to 6 per cent. But scientists are pretty sure that there must be hundreds of thousands of “invisible” cases with symptoms so mild that the carrier hasn’t been tested. That is how they get to their best guess death rate of 1 per cent.The chances are that the real rate could be lower still. The NHS is better prepared than China’s health system was when this started, not least because it is better funded and we have had time to get ready. But the risk for the elderly is still uncomfortably high. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, did not manage to sound entirely reassuring when asked to calm fears amongst old people and he replied: “The great majority of people will survive this.” By which he means around 85 per cent, from the data so far.There is also a question-mark around smokers. One theory is that the higher death rate for men and the deaths among young, seemingly fit health workers in China is due to smoking, but there is no data either way. Brits, fortunately, smoke less than the Chinese.Unfortunately, efforts at containment are hitting an intractable problem. Of the 163 cases identified at the time of writing (of about 20,000 tested) in the UK, at least a dozen simply cannot be traced back to any other known case or foreign travel. In other words, the illness is already spreading undetected. One possibility is that children, who mercifully seem to be less vulnerable to the disease, are nonetheless getting it and displaying no symptoms, thereby acting as silent spreaders. This is one reason why schools for nearly 300 million children worldwide are now closed.These other countries who are shutting schools and cancelling conferences are doing so not because they are a bunch of overreacting wimps, but because it may be one of the most effective ways to slow the spread of the disease. Over here, UK policymakers are watching attentively to see whether it works and if we ought to do likewise. Whether this hesitation is sensible and proportionate or a historic mistake is not yet clear.The unspoken truth is that these decisions are ultimately about risk appetite. Scientists can offer advice, but the uncertainties are so great that politicians ultimately have to take decisions about how far to go. The government appears, so far, to be taking the risk that it is not worth implementing measures that cause enormous disruption China, because widespread contagion is ultimately inevitable.There are good reasons for this approach. We know that the epidemic has slowed down in China, but we have no idea if this is due to its drastic quarantine measures, which have plunged its economy into deep freeze. It seems more likely that China’s supreme effort at contact-tracing, which involves finding and testing everyone who has had intimate contact with virus sufferers, was the key factor in dampening down the virus’ spread. The UK has traced the contacts of confirmed patients as much as it can so far.Disruption also has other costs. There have been Chinese cases reported of people in need of urgent medical care for other illnesses but finding themselves trapped in their houses because of the shutdown. And you cannot keep an economy in lockdown forever. When workers return to factories and children go back to school, contagion may well flare up again. Even if we were to shut down schools now, who is to say the virus would not just come back when they reopened?The UK’s approach carries its own risks, however. It may turn out that a short, sharp period of disruption now would stop the virus in its tracks and that we are missing a vital chance. It is hard to imagine that this would not be the undisputed policy choice if those at most risk were young children, rather than the elderly.The virus planning paper released this week estimated that, in a worst-case scenario, 80 per cent of people could ultimately get infected. Such an enormous epidemic is unlikely, but if the virus grows on anything like that scale, the disruption to daily life and the health system will make a few conference cancellations look like a mere prelude. In Hubei province, for example, where the virus first emerged, there are just over 67,000 confirmed cases. That is equivalent to just 0.1 per cent of the population. Even accounting for the many “invisible” cases that have not been identified, the gap between 0.1 and 80 per cent suggests that scientists think there is a long, long way to go before this thing dies down.Boris Johnson is keen to put the country at ease. This week, he claimed to have visited a hospital of coronavirus patients and, “I shook hands with everybody!” But we should be under no illusions. This isn’t just a bad flu season and we don’t yet know what it will take to get it even vaguely under control.

They could be told to self-isolate if they’ve got symptoms, to call NHS 111, or simply be reminded to wash their hands.The plan is understood to have been devised by Public Health England, which then approached the telecoms firms through the DCMS. Companies will be asked about the cost and feasibility of adopting the system before the outbreak reaches its expected peak in the coming weeks. There are already more than 160 cases in the UK (see map below).Last night, Lord Harris of Haringey, who sits on the National Security Strategy Committee, urged the government to deliver the alerting system as soon as possible.This would appear to be a good idea, he said.Any way to get information out there quickly and easily must be welcomed. My only worry is that these messages will have to be quite long, so I do wonder whether people would actually read them.We can\u0027t be bombarding people, otherwise they\u0027ll just switch off.Under EU law, every citizen using their mobile phone when travelling to another member state must automatically receive a text message with emergency information on arrival.In the UK, the welcome messages are sent only to mobile phones registered in foreign countries. The coronavirus plan would see SMS texts sent to every phone, including returning British citizens.Officials from the Cabinet Office have also contacted telecoms firms to discuss a more ambitious cell broadcasting system, it is understood.Unlike the welcome message technology, the system would allow alerts to be sent to specific geographic areas deemed to be at risk. The technology is already used in other countries including the US to warn against nuclear attack or natural disaster.Supporters claim the message alerts could have saved lives during major incidents including the London Bridge terrorist attack and Grenfell Tower fire.Senior figures have raised concerns, however, that the messages could be hijacked by hackers or malicious foreign powers to induce mass panic.The project is being overseen by Dr Nigel P. Brown from the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, the government body responsible for emergency planning, and officials from Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Fujitsu, the Japanese telecommunications giant, was commissioned last year to examine how the system could be developed in the UK.The idea of a public alert system was also heavily backed by police and fire chiefs in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack, The  disclosed.During a secret summit on Dec 5, a week after the attack, senior fire and police officers asked why it was taking so long for the technology to be introduced in Britain.Held at the BT Tower in central London, the summit was attended by officials from the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, the government body responsible for emergency planning, and senior leaders from the NHS, National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council, politan Police and National Fire Chiefs Council. Multiple sources told The  of their frustration at the Government\u0027s slow progress in adopting a public alert system. One senior officer is said to have asked why emergency workers are expected to tackle major disasters with older technology than the public we are trying to help. A mass warning system using SMS technology was trialled in 2013 but returned “disappointing” results, according to government documents.The new cell broadcasting system would automatically send alerts to every smartphone regardless of whether the user had opted in. Major mobile phone operators have helped develop the technology for use in the UK while the Australian government, which uses the system during wildfires, has also been asked for advice.The approach is already used widely in other countries including the United States and India. In January 2018, an incoming missile alert plunged residents of Hawaii into panic before it was declared a false alarm. Later it emerged that a junior worker had accidentally pressed the wrong button.A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport refused to comment last night.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stocking loo roll may not bum idea","story":"Of all the household products that most people would fear running short of it is surely lavatory paper that tops the listAside from prescription medicines, of all the household products that most people would fear running short of it is surely lavatory paper that tops the list. And the panic-buying of is not as irrational as it might appear.In short, we don’t make much of it. This country is one of Europe’s biggest importers of lavatory paper and disposable nappies (which use pulp paper). Around 85 per cent – or 1.1 million out of 1.3 million tonnes – of all the toilet tissue used in the UK annually is imported, according to The Confederation of Paper Industries.The real question, as the urge to prep for the coming coronavirus outbreak takes hold, is how likely is the UK to run out? Australia, which is highly reliant on Chinese supply chains that have been crunched by draconian factory closures, has already seen panic-buying to the point where the government has introduced controls. Shopkeepers have had to call the police in to break up fights over the last few rolls available, such are the indignities of rushing to preserve one’s dignity in a crisis.For now, no-one expects European countries to face that kind of crunch since the levels of factory closures possible in Xi Jinping’s China are much less acceptable over here. The odds are still that the paper mills of Scandinavia will keep on turning, and the UK will still be adequately catered for – so long as nobody panics.Which is, of course, the problem. Back during last year’s no-deal Brexit preparations, Government advisers told me quietly that “the one thing I’d stockpile, if I was you” was loo paper, given the UK’s vulnerability to supply chain disruption. This, of course, I rapidly shared with  readers.Loo paper is bulky, so if everyone buys two or three extra packets, very quickly you start to see wide empty spaces opening up on supermarket shelves, which only redoubles the panic. If there’s no loo paper, even the most sanguine shopper will ask, then what next? Simultaneously, this shakes confidence in government assurances that there is enough of everything to go round – meaning that promises of plenty made in good faith in the morning media round can be rendered worthless by the afternoon.Which brings us back to Brexit. As things stand, the Government under Boris Johnson is charging much harder towards the Brexit finish line than that of his predecessor Theresa May, overtly threatening a no-deal Australian-style if the EU does not come to heel. The transport industry is very clear that this risks bringing back the spectre of long delays at the ports, clogging up the Channel Tunnel as hauliers battle with mountains of new paperwork and customs and safety declarations.If that happens, there remains a serious risk that the Australian-style Brexit might include some Australian-style loo-paper shortages. Those coronavirus stockpiles might come in handy yet.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

How do I self-isolate? Is it the same as social distancing? Why are things different in France and Italy? And what about my gran?Confusion is growing over the Government’s “contain, delay, research and mitigate strategy”. For some, it is provoking anxiety and in others complacency is setting in. The problem is fueled by its title. It mixes goals with actions and encourages the idea that its components must follow one another in strict sequence: contain - delay - research - mitigate. The Number 10 press team may have thought the sound-bitey title would appeal to a British sense of orderliness, but it’s a poor shorthand for the real deal. Even Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer and a man who knows an objective from an action, is struggling: We are now basically, mainly in delay, but we are maintaining some elements of contain, we are mainly in the second stage at this point”, he told MPs on Friday. The actual strategy we are following comes from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU’s main public health body. Its timeline is defined, not by objectives, but the likely progress of an outbreak in five scenarios (zero to four) as it moves across Europe. At one end of the continuum is “scenario 0”, a country like Bulgaria with no recorded cases. At the other end is “scenario 4”, a country like Italy with widespread infection.At each stage in the timeline, the principle objective a government should be pursuing is given - containment, delay and mitigation, etc. Below that are all the practical measures and actions it should be taking to achieve the objective - contact tracing, hand washing messages, school closures etc.  Laying out the strategy like this has benefits. It drives home that a disease outbreak is not a static thing but one which develops over time. Questions about differing national responses start to fade, because it becomes apparent they are at different points on the same epidemic curve but following common guidelines.Crucially for the designated “public face” of the response - Prof Whitty in England - it becomes obvious that things like containment, delay and research will be happening simultaneously much of the time. The UK sits at or about scenario 2 on the ECDC document, with cases that have been imported and some local human-to human transmission. The main goal for the moment is contain and delay and all the counter measures recommended for this phase have been implemented.Next stop will be scenario 3, roughly where France, Spain and Germany sit now. This is when localised outbreaks start to merge and sustained human-to-human transmission takes grip, putting pressure on the health service. A range of “mitigation” measures including the possible cancellation of mass gatherings, such as sports events and concerts, will then be considered. France has placed a ban on gatherings of over 5,000 people, for example.It is still not certain that we will move to the next phase, although it is probable. The UK response has so far been strong and it may yet prove possible to contain the virus. Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: I think we\u0027re doing relatively well, I think those that have been diagnosed positive seem to have been diagnosed quickly, which minimises their chances of spreading it and also maximises treatment possibility.  Prof Jones said there was also a degree of luck involved: It depends on the density of the population and frequency of travel within that population. If someone is in the middle of Cornwall in a farmhouse not going anywhere, they won\u0027t catch it or spread it. That\u0027s obviously a very different scenario compared to someone in central Manchester”. Others said the key to understanding the Government’s strategy was to regard it as “flexible”. In different phases, the Government\u0027s actions may remain the same but be re-emphasised. If a pocket of the country remained virus free it would be perfectly sensible to put in place containment measures there, even if the disease was widespread elsewhere and mitigation measures were dominant. The need for research will be a constant throughout.I think it\u0027s a strategy based on the evidence here in the UK and in my view it\u0027s one that should be as modified as risk assessments tell, said David Heymann, an epidemiologist and former assistant director general of the WHO. It\u0027s flexible and if there is new evidence it can rapidly change. Interventions can be singular or blended.There is also some confusion about what has become known as self isolation or voluntary quarantine, with many unsure what it entails and others interpreting it overly literally.  Do you lock yourself in the loo and avoid all people, or do you remain in the house but don’t go out? To what extent are you isolated alone or with other people? This is something that has to be judged on a case by case basis, said Prof Jones, who suggested a common sense approach - don’t self isolate with elderly relatives, for instance. If the outbreak progresses to scenario three or four in the UK on the ECDC scale, the major pinch point will be a squeeze on NHS services. Although the UK ranks number two in the world for pandemic preparedness, our underfunded health system is a weak point. Other issues include high levels of urbanisation, age profile of the population and the fact that some elements of our preparedness are not made available for external review.Jonathan Ball, professor of virology at the University of Nottingham, said that self isolation as a means to take pressure off the NHS was a necessary risk: There\u0027s just not the capacity in hospitals and there\u0027s no medical or clinical reason to keep someone with something that is essentially a cold in hospital.The only benefit of the hospital policy previously was containment - that\u0027s the risk, you\u0027re reliant on goodwill. In terms of care and health of the patient there\u0027s no problem, but the patients really do need to adhere to not wandering around the community if we\u0027re going to continue to slow this virus down.  Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"carrie symonds pictured first time wearing engagement ring","story":"Carrie Symonds has been pictured for the first time since announcing her and the Prime Minister are expecting a baby, showing off her blossoming bump and a prominent engagement ring.The Prime Minister\u0027s fiancée stepped out in a long floral gown with the large jewel on her ring finger during a reception at 10 Downing Street ahead of International Women\u0027s Day on Sunday.Her which is thought to be an antique, resembles a flower, with a square emerald in the centre surrounded by petal-shaped diamonds.Ms Symonds, 31, and Boris Johnson, 55, were seen greeting guests including environmental activist Lizzie Carr, the winner of the Points of Light award.Points of Light are outstanding iniduals who are making a change in their community, and every weekday the Prime Minister recognises an inspirational volunteer with the award.Ms Symonds announced her and Mr Johnson\u0027s engagement and that they are expecting their first baby together in a social media post last week.In a post on her private Instagram account, accompanied by an intimate photo of the pair, she wrote: I wouldn\u0027t normally post this kind of thing on here but I wanted my friends to find out from me.Many of you already know but for my friends that still don\u0027t, we got engaged at the end of last year... and we\u0027ve got a baby hatching early summer. Feel incredibly blessed.The date of their wedding has not been announced, but it will mark the first time in at least 250 years that a sitting prime minister has married while in office.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2019/12/20/TELEMMGLPICT000207042991_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7Co14yRc9LT310GoJETzTos.jpeg?imwidth=45","title":"dont want psychodrama science fiction want good old fashioned","story":"I can’t be alone in pining for the days when a space flick didn’t inevitably involve plumbing the dullest hours of Brad Pitt’s therapy sessionsIt’s that inevitable moment that most science fiction movies seem to reach nowadays, where the hero, tear rolling slowly down his manly cheek, says: “I love you, dad.” I couldn’t suppress a huge yawn. If the virus puts us all in quarantine for weeks, there could be a lot more of this. At least the movie in question, Ad Astra, has increased the portion of time I will spend reading over watching.I love a good, escapist sci fi. But lately, the genre has been wholly taken over by Hollywood psychodramas, usually involving some dysfunctional relationship with a parent or spouse (Ad Astra, Annihilation, Interstellar, even Star Wars) or loss of a child (Gravity, Arrival) and very often encompassing a Heart of Darkness-style evil genius who has decided to destroy the world (Sunshine, Ad Astra). It’s not that space travel isn’t a good vehicle for exploring age-old human problems, if it’s done creatively. But I can’t be alone in pining for the days when a space flick didn’t inevitably involve plumbing the dullest hours of Brad Pitt’s therapy sessions.Back in the day, science fiction was all about gallivanting around the universe, saving it from evil. That approach had its flaws too, not least the often very thin efforts at characterisation. Still, I wonder what it says about Western civilisation that so many of our escapist space fantasies keep leading us back into the troubled, domestic space of our own minds.Friedrich Nietzsche thought that creativity borne of such neurosis was a sure sign of decadence and civilisational decay. So not only do I have to sit through another scene in which a hero floating around in the ether struggles metaphorically and physically to hold onto his space-walking companion before travelling 1,000 kilometres through a ring of space rocks with only a dustbin lid for cover it also means that our way of life is doomed. I eagerly await the release of a Chinese Star Wars.The Science Museum’s “wonder lab” is billed as being for children, but on a recent visit, I saw little that wasn’t also interesting to adults. There were two long cables being spun by small motors on each end, whose speed could be adjusted with dials. As the speed changed, they formed dizzying, fascinating undulations of different widths and shapes.Nearby, you could drop a ball into a “double gravity well” (two big dips next to each other) and watch as it coursed around in a figure of eight before disappearing. In another corner there was a pool of ferrous liquid that formed itself into tight, hedgehog-like balls of cones when attracted by a huge magnet underneath.Next to that, you could experiment with camera shutter speed to capture the exact moment a drop falling into a beaker caused a glimmering coronet of water globules to erupt around it. A show about electric charge ended by releasing an enormous crack of electricity, a silver bolt part-way between an electric shock and a lightning bolt.The discipline of having to design something for children is helpful, because most children will not engage in something entirely abstract. Yet as we grow up we are expected to deal in abstractions more and more.Our willingness to do so is important because successful countries must nurture a strong culture of respect for scientific knowledge, even if we also keep up a healthy attitude of scepticism towards authority. This respect for science is an act of faith for most people, though. We cannot see the virus we are washing away when we follow public health advice, but thankfully, most of us will do it diligently all the same.Still, it is refreshing to visit a place where you can see scientific concepts at work with your own eyes. I might recommend waiting until the epidemic is on the wane, however. The place looked like a petri dish for germs. Fortunately, they remained invisible to the naked eye.The adult equivalent of a child play area is, of course, a gym. Mine recently sent out a note to members asking them to use wipes provided to wipe down equipment and asking us to stay away if we had any symptoms, even mild ones. Helpfully, it did not mention what the main symptoms are. At the bottom of the email, under its logo, was the gym’s usual, tough-guy strapline: “Anything goes”. They had forgotten to add a useful footnote: “Anything goes.

They operate 15 stages of a production line which transforms ordinary vehicles to make them accessible for people with disabilitiesWorkers at each stage have specialised expertise which can’t necessarily be replaced if significant numbers are off work. Clearly working from home is not an option.“It’s very difficult. We can move people from other parts of the business but at some point we would not be running efficiently,” says Pow. “We’re not just going to shut our doors and say, ‘Things are a bit difficult, let’s stop working.’\u0026nbspThere’s a bit of that wartime spirit.”For Allied, Brexit, and the\u0026nbspuncertainty over what it will entail, represent bigger concerns than the virus, says Pow –\u0026nbspat least for now.The company exports vehicles to countries across western Europe. It is already concerned about tariffs and the effect of a highly uncertain future. “Brexit is affecting both the reality of our business and our customers’ confidence,” says Pow, who is concerned the company will be less competitive in future with rivals based inside the EU.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Costs have shot up around 15 per cent so far as the company struggles to find enough ships to transport its products, says commercial manager\u0026nbspJohn Stephenson.\u0026nbspTudor Rose is losing sales as ships stay stuck in Chinese ports, causing a major backlog in the key arteries of world trade.\u0026nbspWith many Chinese factories shut down to contain the virus’s spread, there is much less to ship and so freight companies have cancelled sailings. That leaves British firms facing a shortage of containers to put their goods into, pushing up prices.“It has an effect all along those routes via places like Mumbai and the Middle East,” says\u0026nbspStephenson.Shipping is often seen as a canary in the coal mine for economic shocks to come. With a vessel taking about a month to make its way from China to Europe, the sharp drop in activity in China is still working its way through.Stephenson estimates that there are about 100 fewer vessels on the global routes along which Tudor Rose ships its food and drink. That may not sound like a lot but each one is vast, carrying an average 20,000 containers.Two million fewer containers has a real impact, says Stephenson. “It’s already been quite pronounced. We’ve had a customer already waiting for a large order that we haven’t been able to fill.”Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe effect coronavirus is having on shipping is unprecedented, he says. “We do see some seasonality of demand but we’ve not seen an event like this that’s had this much impact.”Tudor Rose has been looking to boost sales in North America where disruption has been less severe than Asia but there is a limit to this strategy.“We sell fast-moving consumer goods so we need a consistent, regular supply to our customers,” says Stephenson. The company anticipates some rebound in demand when the outbreak calms down but for the most part, sales lost now are likely to be lost for good.If Chinese ports open up fully again things will improve, but Tudor Rose fears there may be further shutdowns at other key points along the route as governments seek to contain the virus.“We are at the early stages of this. It’s only in the last 10\u0026nbspdays that it’s come to light how significant this could be,”\u0026nbspsays StephensonBack in Glasgow, Donald Pow is remaining vigilant but relatively relaxed, given the situation. “We don’t know what’s going to happen many of the experts don’t seem to know what’s going to happen.”“It’s like that old football manager cliche: we just take each game as it comes.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Or are companies in for disappointment?Hundreds of flights have been cancelled, major sporting events called off.Business has dried up entirely for some unfortunate firms.The economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak has already been significant.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd it’s likely to get worse.There’s speculation the Tokyo Olympics this summer might need to be postponed – a festival on which the Japanese government has already spent some $25bn (£19bn).But that’s why businesses and iniduals take out insurance isn’t it? To cover themselves for when unexpected and hugely damaging shocks like disease outbreaks hit?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Latest travel updates as coronavirus continues to spreadCan face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe UK government this week, under pressure from industry lobby groups, designated\u0026nbspCovid-19 a “notifiable disease”, in order to make it easier for affected companies to claim insurance.So can we expect an avalanche of claims and big losses for insurance companies as a result of this outbreak?Or are companies in for disappointment if they expect to be compensated for the economic damage wreaked by Covid-19?It’s worth drawing a distinction between two broad categories of business insurance, say experts.First, there’s event cancellation insurance, which is a type generally offered by sophisticated insurance markets like Lloyd’s of London or major insurance conglomerates.Torsten Jeworrek of the German insurer Munich Re\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspReuters\u0026nbsplast month that his firm had provided cancellation insurance for the Tokyo games “in the hundreds of millions of euros”.Second, there’s the more general cover for “business interruption” offered to companies by smaller insurance firms.But if a firm is covered it’s covered, isn’t it?Not necessarily. It all depends on the wording of the inidual insurance contract.But it’s important to bear a broad principle in mind, namely that there’s a difference from the perspective of the insurance company between “definable” and “undefinable” risk.And insurance firms are unlikely to have written an insurance policy that covers a firm from the impact of an undefinable risk.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Think of a hotel that sees its bookings slump because people change their travel plans. Or a company that suffers because it’s staff don’t turn up to work because of illness.Would cutting rates really help the economy deal with coronavirus?In any case, industry experts caution that “notifiable disease” clauses (the classification the UK government updated this week) are not standard in insurance contracts.“Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks, not those that are very unlikely, such as the effects of Covid-19,” said a spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers.So what’s the bottom line: are insurers going to be hit hard or not?Crawford Forensic Accounting Services produced a report last month on the likely impact of coronavirus on the insurance sector.It concluded that “successful claims under business interruption coverage for infection are not common”.Crawford director Frederique Hardy also told The Independent that event cancellation insurance contracts tend to be very bespoke, making it difficult to generalise about the ability of event organisers to make claim.Yet the general view of the industry – at the moment – is that coronavirus is unlikely to result in an explosion of costly payouts.If that’s correct it points to a lot of disappointed firms.And, as a by product, it’s likely to increase further the pressure on governments to give stressed companies economic relief in the form of more time to pay tax and perhaps forbearance on debt repayments to banks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of Australia also cut rates, with investors expecting other major central banks to soon follow suit.Officials and companies in Britain, France, Italy and the United States are struggling to deal with a steady rise in virus infections that have in some cases triggered corporate defaults, office evacuations, and panic buying of daily necessities.The outbreak spread across the United States on Thursday, surfacing in at least four new states.“The interplay of virus containment fears and stimulus measures means that in the near term we expect market volatility to persist,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.Yields on US Treasuries fell to a record low and Treasury futures jumped as investors increased bets that the Fed will follow this week’s surprise rate cut with further easing.The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to a record low of 0.7650 per cent on Friday.Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari said late on Thursday the Fed could cut rates further if needed.Money markets are pricing in another 25 basis-point-cut from the current 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent range at the next Fed meeting on March 18-19 and a 50-basis-point cut by April.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government is meanwhile expected to warn elderly citizens to stay at home as part of incoming “social distancing” policies next week, after a man in his early 80s became the second to die of Covid-19 on Friday.The number of cases in Britain is now at 164 while the global tally has risen to 100,000, with Iran reporting a surge of 1,000 new cases in 24 hours after the Netherlands declared its first death from the disease on Friday and\u0026nbspSerbia, Slovakia, Peru, Togo, Colombia and Cameroon all confirmed their first infections.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPlease allow a moment for our liveblog to loadElderly UK citizens \u0027will be warned to stay indoors\u0027 to prevent exposureGlobal total number of cases rises to 100,000Scotland Women\u0027s rugby player tests positive for Covid-19Iran reports 1,000 new cases in 24 hours as first case diagnosed in MaltaSeventh passenger aboard Diamond\u0026nbspPrincess dies as virus continues global spreadWe\u0027re just hearing that another person taken ill aboard the liner under quarantine in the Port of Yokohama, Japan,\u0026nbsphas now died.As the coronavirus continues to spread here are some of the latest updates we\u0027re hearing from around the world:\u0026nbsp- South Korea\u0027s cases are up to 6,767- France\u0027s health ministry says 11 people have now died and its number of confirmed cases is up to 716- Germany\u0027s cases has jumped to 684- The Netherlands has 188- Vietnam now has 20 cases-\u0026nbspThe UAE and Qatar now have\u0026nbsp45 and 12 cases respectively- Mexico and the Philippines now have six cases each- Afghanistan has fourNot encouraging, to put it mildly.The US - were the number of cases diagnosed is up to 338, with 15 dead - has most recently raised travel alert levels for Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan - but, for Trump (a notorious germophobe), the problem might lie closer to home.It transpires that two people who attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in DC this week have since tested positive. That event was attended by the president\u0027s veep Mike Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo, among many others in his inner circle.Unchastened, the president continued to downplay the significance of the outbreak to a gaggle of supporters and donors at his Florida home Mar-a-Lago last night.Barcelona marathon suspended and SXSW Festival cancelledEvents around the world continue to be hit by the spread of the virus, with the Spanish city\u0027s long-distance race the latest casualty.It was due to take place on Sunday 15 March but will not now happen until Sunday 25 October.Yesterday saw the cancellation of several other key sporting events including the World Athletics Half Marathon Championships in Poland, the Milan-San Remo cycling classic, World\u0026nbspAlpine Skiing World Cup and the Rome E-Prix in Italy plus Paris St-Germain v Strasbourg in France.Premier League players in Britain will also not shake hands before matches this weekend, as is customary, to avoid transmitting the contagion.But perhaps the biggest event to be shutdown though was the massive culture and technology festival SXSW in Texas.Here\u0027s Alex Woodward on that one.\u0026nbspChina reports no new cases in Hubei as situation in outbreak epicentre Wuhan continues to improveOfficials in China have said for the first time since the start of the outbreak there are no new cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province outside of its capital Wuhan, says our politics editor Andrew Woodcock.New cases in Wuhan itself are expected to drop to zero by the end of the month.World Health Organisation (WHO) assistant director-general Bruce Aylward said the rest of the world must learn from the “heroic” Chinese response to the virus.Responding to the latest infection figures from Hubei, Dr Aylward told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “We can definitely be relieved and encouraged because here we had the epicentre where everybody said it was completely out of control and nothing could be done and China have managed to turn it around.”Dr Aylward said the biggest lesson for Western countries from the Chinese experience was not the “draconian” approach taken in shutting down Wuhan, but the speed with which infected people were identified and isolated.He said governments outside China were “obviously not” acting quickly enough.“You have got to find the cases very, very quickly, get them isolated, find their close contacts, because these people are where the virus is,” said Dr Aylward.“If you can get them isolated and quarantined, you can take the heat out of this outbreak and you will save a lot of lives.”He warned: “Despite the weeks of time which China has bought the world with their heroic efforts, other countries are still surprised when it hits their borders and they don’t know how to isolate or how to test.”Dr Aylward, who visited Wuhan as part of a WHO fact-finding mission at the start of the outbreak in February, said that a crucial factor was the “extraordinary” willingness of the Chinese people to accept a collective responsibility for slowing the spread of the virus.“The single biggest thing we can learn from China is the importance of ensuring your population is with you, because that’s your surveillance system,” he said.“Make sure the population understands what this disease is, understands how to get tested, understands that they will not be bankrupted by having a test or being isolated for a couple of weeks if necessary.\u0026nbsp“If your population is working with you you can get the speed you need.”He dismissed the suggestion that China was able to contain the disease only because of its authoritarian political system.Speaking to ordinary people in China, “what they feared was not the government, they feared the virus and they feared failing in their collective responsibility to try to slow this down”, he said.LeBron James refuses to play NBA games in empty arenasThe basketball superstar is reusing to comply with his sport\u0027s governing body\u0027s suggestion that league games will have to go ahead without fans in attendance as part of a bid to clampdown on the spread of the coronavirus.Whether other sports stars will react similarly remains to be seen but such measures have already been implemented in Italy, with Serie A matches being played in ghostly silence.\u0027Tell us straight, Matt Hancock - should we stockpile or not?\u0027Here\u0027s our latest editorial on the crisis, calling on the health secretary to come clean on how Britain should be preparing for the escalating epidemic.\u0026nbspWashington residents furious over motel quarantine plans\u0026nbspIn the US, Seattle’s plan for a quarantine facility has sparked outrage among members of the community where the building is located.\u0026nbspSome residents of Kent, Washington - a suburb near the motel being eyed for the role - are upset that King County officials are planning to buy and renovate an Econo Lodge and turn it into a quarantine facility for people infected with coronavirus.\u0026nbspThe first - and so far, majority of - cases of coronavirus in the US have been reported in Washington.According to Bloomberg, the 85-bedroom motel would house virus patients who were not ill enough to warrant hospital stays, but who still required isolation from healthy populations. It would also allow hospital beds to stay open for patients in dire health in need of hospitalisation. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDana Ralph, the mayor of Kent, said she understood the need for housing but wasn’t happy her community wasn’t considered during the planning of the motel programme.\u0026nbsp“We’re one of the largest cities in the county, and we know we have a role to play in preventing the spread of the virus. But we were not included in the conversation or decision making.”Graig Graziosi has more on this.\u0026nbspUnnamed Scotland Women\u0027s rugby player tests positive for Covid-19 A female Scottish rugby international has tested positive for the coronavirus after visiting Italy for an international game on 23 February that was never played.A statement on Scottish Rugby\u0027s official website said the player in question has been admitted to a health care facility as part of the protocol but was otherwise well and that seven members of management and players were self-isolating in accordance with medical advice.Thousands stranded aboard cruise liner off CaliforniaIn the US, thousands of people are currently stranded off the coast of San Francisco aboard a luxury cruise liner, the Grand\u0026nbspPrincess, after 21 passengers were found to have contracted Covid-19, as the number of cases in the US spiked to more than 250.Of the people infected, 19 are crew members and two are passengers.

In life, her dentition appears to have been pristine – with virtually no pre-death wear and tear.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But as coastal erosion undercut the cliffs, the abbesses who succeeded her\u0026nbspincreasingly realised that the building would eventually end up crashing into the sea below.Some time in the eighth century\u0026nbspher remains were removed from the stricken chapel and put into a specially built shrine in the nunnery’s main church.\u0026nbspBy the late 11 century, the nunnery had become a monastery.However, following the Norman conquest, a\u0026nbspcastle was built around it – so, in the 12\u0026nbspcentury, the monks demanded that they be allowed to move to a new, less secular, site.The princess’s bones were therefore disinterred again\u0026nbspand moved, in 1138, a few hundred metres away to a brand new church, a later version of which still stands today as Folkestone’s Parish Church. There she became the centre of a local cult and was believed to be able to help cure disease. Her official saint’s day\u0026nbspis 12 September.But, after the mediaeval period had drawn to a close, Eanswythe’s story took a new and unexpected turn.When Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England, the government became increasingly hostile to the veneration of saints. In 1535, the prior of Folkestone seems to have realised that, unless he took drastic action, government officials would seize and destroy Eanswythe’s bones. So he (or some of his monks) appear to have hurriedly forced the lead box containing them\u0026nbspinto a secret hole in the church wall and blocked it off.The prior, or a senior church member, then showed the officials a probably gold or gem-studded reliquary, almost certainly containing just a few parts of the saint’s skull.Discoveries offer detailed glimpse of life in prehistoric BritainThat box, with its diminished contents, was subsequently seized by the government and was then acquired by a member of Henry VIII’s household, a Folkestone politician and businessman called Anthony Aucher, who no doubt profited substantially by selling any gems which had adorned the reliquary.Meanwhile, Eanswythe rested safe and secure in her dark hiding place inside the church’s north wall, just beside the altar.Gradually her hiding place was forgotten – until, in 1885, workmen engaged in modernising the church\u0026nbspstumbled across her remains. There was immediate speculation about the possibility that they could be the bones of St Eanswythe and the discovery was reported in newspapers worldwide.But in the 19th century, there was no way of confirming her identity.So for 132 years, the bones were stashed away in a specially constructed wall niche and once again began to fade from memory, until just three years ago a group of local historians and archaeologists decided to try to solve the mystery.They did so by asking scientists to examine the bones in order to discover the long-dead inidual’s age at death and sex – and by carrying out radiocarbon dating tests to ascertain whether the bones did indeed date from the seventh century.The answers virtually proved that the fragmentary skeleton was indeed that of St Eanswythe.The scientists were able to demonstrate that the inidual was almost certainly female.Medieval sources had said that she had died very young – and the scientific examination of her bones and teeth revealed that the inidual had been between 17 and 21 years old when she had passed away.The radiocarbon tests then revealed that she had died in the mid-seventh century – the exact period when Eanswythe‘s life ended.What’s more, examination of her teeth showed virtually no pre-death scratches on her tooth enamel, a fact that suggests that she had consumed relatively little coarse food.Throughout the medieval period, a large number of stories attached themselves to her. She was credited with at least five miracles\u0026nbspand was venerated by people in the Folkestone area.She was believed, for instance, to have miraculously made water run uphill (a story probably developed in order to explain an optical illusion which seemed to show a local aqueduct channelling water up a gradient). She was also credited for resurrecting a dead goose that had been stolen and eaten.Eanswythe was also said to have miraculously lengthened a wooden beam to construct a church by calling on Christ to help when a pagan king and his gods had failed to lengthen it.And after her death, her ghost was said to have cured a man suffering from leprosy or some other skin disease.Remains of ‘man who named Australia’ found during HS2 excavationWho was Suzy Lamplugh? New excavations aim to solve 1986 murderExcavations of medieval chapel at site linked to King ArthurBut, beyond those legends, what was her real significance?In a sense, she symbolises the huge contribution to early English history made by high-status women.\u0026nbspPrior to the coming of Christianity, it is not known whether Anglo-Saxon women played any major political roles.But the coming of Christianity certainly provided one. Princesses played a major part in the conversion of England from paganism to the new faith. When Anglo-Saxon and other Christian princesses married pagan Anglo-Saxon kings, their presence often allowed Christianity to gain the upper hand and flourish.What’s more, those royal daughters who did not marry kings and princes were established by their royal fathers or brothers as abbesses of a new type of institution – nunneries, which in turn, alongside the monasteries, began to wield substantial social and cultural influence. Many of the new abbesses (like Eanswythe) became popular saints and were revered for centuries.St Eanswythe died some 1,360 years ago\u0026nbspbut her newly rediscovered life and times are about to captivate a new audience.“Our identification of St Eanswythe’s skeletal remains open up the possibility of using DNA to investigate the ancestry of the Kentish and Frankish royal dynasties,” said the senior archaeologist involved in the project, Dr Andrew Richardson of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust.“St Eanswythe was a local heroine of great relevance to local people. In mediaeval times, they saw her as their protector from disease and suffering. Researching her today will bring the people of Folkestone nearer to that history,” said the head of the Finding Eanswythe project, Dr Lesley Hardy, a historian at Canterbury Christ Church University.The project is being largely financed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 650 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Season five has just arrived and journeys even deeper into the Breaking Bad expanded universe. Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – it turns its attention in its fourth and fifth season to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars, with Diego Luna playing Guadalajara cartel honcho Miguel Gallardo. 1350 Master of NoneA cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, its second run sees Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replace Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs. He’s a perfect fit for the part too, delving into the inner turmoil of a character who accumulates a multitude of ghosts across his endless life.2150 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family. Bateman recently won a best director Emmy for his work on the series, seizing the gong from beneath the noses of Game of Thrones’s David Benioff and DB Weiss. Season three is due in March 2020.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3350 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3850 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4050 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.Henry Cavill stars as titular monster hunter Geralt of Rivia in a pulpy adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski’s best-selling fantasy novels (the show is not directly based on the hit video game series). It’s a ludicrous lark with a plot that often baffles (watch out for those multiple timelines). But Cavill is fantastic as the Witcher and he has a great support cast including Anya Chalotra as sorceress Yennefer , Freya Allan as Princess Ciri and Joey Batey as Jaskier the Bard. It is estimated to be the most in-demand TV show in the world across all platforms. All together now, “toss a coin to your Witcher, oh ratings of plenty…”An old-school, over-the-top thriller, adapted from the Harlan Coben bestseller. The setting is a fictional town of Cedarfield, which seems to be somewhere within commuting distance of Manchester. Richard Armitage plays a loving dad and husband whose world falls apart when a mysterious woman tells him his wife (Dervla Kirwan) faked her pregnancy. Jennifer Saunders later pops up as a mother whose family has its own secrets. 4350 Chilling Adventures of SabrinaBaroque with bells on and camper than a disco ball at a tent convention, Netflix’s rebooting of Sabrina the Teenage Witch makes a virtue of excess. Kiernan Shipka –  Don Draper’s daughter from Mad Men –  lights up the screen as the half-human half witch teenager drawn into a tangle with the devil himself. Miranda Otto and The Office’s Lucy Davies play her eccentric aunts. And there’s a cat named Salem, though he doesn’t talk.4450 Next in FashionFeel-good reality TV was once a contradiction in terms. But the vibes are agreeably optimistic in this fashionista contest in which professional designers compete for a $250,000 price. Presenters Tan France and Alexa Chung bring the common touch and the contestants appear to be enjoying themselves rather than undergoing the ordeal of a lifetime. Essentially, it’s Bake Off on the catwalk.4550 Locke and KeyJoe Hill’s bestselling graphic novels receive the YA treatment in this urban fantasy about a house full of portals to other worlds and the grieving family who make their home there. The break-out performance is by Emilia Jones – daughter of singer Aled – playing middle child Kinsey Locke. Hill, the son of Stephen King, moved heaven and earth to bring his story to the screen and the effort has paid off.Trekkies have agreed to disagree regarding this often madcap reboot of the venerable sci-fi saga. Suffice to say, if starships powered by “spore drives” or Harry Potter’s Jason Isaacs over-acting across multiple dimensions is off-putting then this isn’t the Trek for you. But others have warmed to the ambitious storytelling, top-notch FX and Sonequa Martin-Green’s earnest performance as science officer Michael Burnham.The Spanish thriller has become one of Netflix’s most popular non-English language shows. There’s certainly lots going on. The story begins with a daring raid on the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid, overseen by the mysterious Professor (Álvaro Morte) Thereafter it gets steadily more bonkers and the location shifts from Spain to Germany and Thailand. Though all the twists and turns, highs and lows, Money Heist is never less than gripping. 4850 Night on EarthDavid Attenborough\u0027s Our Planet has hoovered up all the attention. But this UK-made series, narrated by Orange is the New Black’s Samira Wiley, brings a new perspective to wildlife TV. Shot using heat-sensitive cameras, Night on Earth features lions romping by moonlight and cacti blooming under the desert stars. It’s like journeying to another world, with reality only returning as the sun rises. Kaya Scodelario – recently seen in the new BBC adaptation of Agatha Christie’s The White Horse – owns the screen as a promising young skater recovering from a serious injury. Her real challenge is off the rink as she tries to conceal her family’s history of mental illness. It’s clearly pitched at a YA audience and is a bit overwrought in places. But Spinning Out is never less than watchable and it’s a shame it was cancelled after just one series. 5050 Living with YourselfPaul Rudd and Aisling Bea have good chemistry in this mordant comedy about a white collar schlub (Rudd) who, in the depths of a midlife crisis, accidentally clones himself. He is forced to compete with his happier, more confident, wittier alter-ego while his wife (Bea) tries to make sense of the transformation. You’ll chuckle rather than fall over clutching your sides but the leads are likeable and the script hums along.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 650 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Season five has just arrived and journeys even deeper into the Breaking Bad expanded universe. Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret.

Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3850 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4050 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.Henry Cavill stars as titular monster hunter Geralt of Rivia in a pulpy adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski’s best-selling fantasy novels (the show is not directly based on the hit video game series). It’s a ludicrous lark with a plot that often baffles (watch out for those multiple timelines). But Cavill is fantastic as the Witcher and he has a great support cast including Anya Chalotra as sorceress Yennefer , Freya Allan as Princess Ciri and Joey Batey as Jaskier the Bard. It is estimated to be the most in-demand TV show in the world across all platforms. All together now, “toss a coin to your Witcher, oh ratings of plenty…”An old-school, over-the-top thriller, adapted from the Harlan Coben bestseller. The setting is a fictional town of Cedarfield, which seems to be somewhere within commuting distance of Manchester. Richard Armitage plays a loving dad and husband whose world falls apart when a mysterious woman tells him his wife (Dervla Kirwan) faked her pregnancy. Jennifer Saunders later pops up as a mother whose family has its own secrets. 4350 Chilling Adventures of SabrinaBaroque with bells on and camper than a disco ball at a tent convention, Netflix’s rebooting of Sabrina the Teenage Witch makes a virtue of excess. Kiernan Shipka –  Don Draper’s daughter from Mad Men –  lights up the screen as the half-human half witch teenager drawn into a tangle with the devil himself. Miranda Otto and The Office’s Lucy Davies play her eccentric aunts. And there’s a cat named Salem, though he doesn’t talk.4450 Next in FashionFeel-good reality TV was once a contradiction in terms. But the vibes are agreeably optimistic in this fashionista contest in which professional designers compete for a $250,000 price. Presenters Tan France and Alexa Chung bring the common touch and the contestants appear to be enjoying themselves rather than undergoing the ordeal of a lifetime. Essentially, it’s Bake Off on the catwalk.4550 Locke and KeyJoe Hill’s bestselling graphic novels receive the YA treatment in this urban fantasy about a house full of portals to other worlds and the grieving family who make their home there. The break-out performance is by Emilia Jones – daughter of singer Aled – playing middle child Kinsey Locke. Hill, the son of Stephen King, moved heaven and earth to bring his story to the screen and the effort has paid off.Trekkies have agreed to disagree regarding this often madcap reboot of the venerable sci-fi saga. Suffice to say, if starships powered by “spore drives” or Harry Potter’s Jason Isaacs over-acting across multiple dimensions is off-putting then this isn’t the Trek for you. But others have warmed to the ambitious storytelling, top-notch FX and Sonequa Martin-Green’s earnest performance as science officer Michael Burnham.The Spanish thriller has become one of Netflix’s most popular non-English language shows. There’s certainly lots going on. The story begins with a daring raid on the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid, overseen by the mysterious Professor (Álvaro Morte) Thereafter it gets steadily more bonkers and the location shifts from Spain to Germany and Thailand. Though all the twists and turns, highs and lows, Money Heist is never less than gripping. 4850 Night on EarthDavid Attenborough\u0027s Our Planet has hoovered up all the attention. But this UK-made series, narrated by Orange is the New Black’s Samira Wiley, brings a new perspective to wildlife TV. Shot using heat-sensitive cameras, Night on Earth features lions romping by moonlight and cacti blooming under the desert stars. It’s like journeying to another world, with reality only returning as the sun rises. Kaya Scodelario – recently seen in the new BBC adaptation of Agatha Christie’s The White Horse – owns the screen as a promising young skater recovering from a serious injury. Her real challenge is off the rink as she tries to conceal her family’s history of mental illness. It’s clearly pitched at a YA audience and is a bit overwrought in places. But Spinning Out is never less than watchable and it’s a shame it was cancelled after just one series. 5050 Living with YourselfPaul Rudd and Aisling Bea have good chemistry in this mordant comedy about a white collar schlub (Rudd) who, in the depths of a midlife crisis, accidentally clones himself. He is forced to compete with his happier, more confident, wittier alter-ego while his wife (Bea) tries to make sense of the transformation. You’ll chuckle rather than fall over clutching your sides but the leads are likeable and the script hums along.One of Gugliemelli’s alleged victims told BuzzFeed News he was glad Sherry Pie had been disqualified from the show. “I think it was the right thing to do,” he said. “As much as I want to say that our personal lives shouldn’t affect our professional, this is different.“This was premeditated predatory behaviour, and we can’t let any of the LGBTQI youth that’s out there watching think that this is OK in any capacity.”RuPaul’s Drag Race, the show that searches for America\u0027s next drag superstar, streams on Netflix in the UKThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some members of staff working on the scheme may have left their posts for more secure positions.”Ms Lant called on the Home Office to avoid a “cliff-edge” scenario where people suddenly become undocumented for missing the deadline, and demanded clarity around the circumstances under which applications would still be accepted following the cut-off date.\u0026nbspCaitlin Boswell Jones, project officer at the Join Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said the £8m investment was welcome but that it “barely touched” what was needed to support all vulnerable people – and called on ministers to grant automatic settled status to all EU citizens.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The likelihood is that tens of thousands of EU citizens will be unable to apply, will then fall out of status and become vulnerable to the hostile environment.”Marianne Lagrue, policy manager at Coram’s migrant children’s project, said the charity welcomed the Home Office’s announcement, but warned that a finite pot of money\u0026nbspthe lasts for one year was “not going to cut it” for a scheme for which applications are going to get increasingly complex.“The concentration of complex case within the number of cases that remain is getting bigger and bigger as we get closer to the deadline. We expect that there will be a flurry towards the deadline, and there will be people who miss it. Whether or not there will continue to be public money available to assist these people remains an unanswered question,” she said.“The funding needs to be guaranteed in perpetuity and to adequately meet the need and complexity of the cases.”Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesMs Lagrue said that vulnerable applicants would increasingly require legal professionals, rather than NGOs, to help them apply – and called on the government to consider introducing legal aid for these cases.“Rather than creating something new specifically to meet the needs of this cohort, the Home Office needs to fund the basic tenets of the welfare state that are there to capture these people with their legal problems,” she said.“The government needs to take a holistic view of the long-term needs of people. Anyone with a complex case and anyone who has an appeal should be eligible for legal aid.”It comes after it emerged\u0026nbspthe EU settlement scheme was responsible for breaching\u0026nbspGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law 100 times between April and August last year.A report by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI) also raised concerns about a lack of support for vulnerable applicants, hidden costs of applying and a lack of transparency and detail in the Home Office data.In total, 3.2 million people have so far registered for EU settled status, which they must obtain in order to continue living legally in the UK after June 2021. Of these, 2.7 million have been granted the status – meaning around 500,000 applications are currently going through the system.Announcing the new funding on Friday, Mr Foster said: “EU citizens are an integral part of our society, culture and community, and this is their home. Supporting vulnerable EU citizens and their families is at the forefront of our approach to the EU Settlement Scheme.The Home Office has been contacted for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Hook, line, and sinker, I guess. He did it.”Mr Adigrati said the thief probably did not know the value of the necklace.“This particular necklace looks a lot more expensive than what it is, so obviously the temptation was there: gold, bright, iconic Medusa head, so that would have been the temptation,” he told ABC News.Police are appealing for more information on the man, who has yet to be identified. He is described as white, aged between 40 to 50 years old and about 5ft 9in.The thief left just one clue behind – the hook from his fishing line.Senior constable Bede Whitty said he had never seen a crime quite like it before.“It’s fairly blatant and it’s quite bold as well, to have someone attend with a fishing rod in the middle of the night,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In extreme poverty, there is just not the ability to wash and sanitise hands regularly, for example.But this is the UK – one of the richest countries in the western world. We have the ability to collectively try and shut this disease down from spreading here.I’ve been fascinated and horried in equal measure over the past week on my talkRADIO show as listeners have shared true gross out stories of folk not washing their hands after going to the public loos or coughing all over communal food in the workplace or sneezing without a tissue on public transport.We can do better. And now we must – our very way of le could be dependent on it.In Japan where the tradition of wearing masks began, it was because people who had colds wanted to try and protect others from their germs.And perhaps Kim Woodburn – the undisputed queen of clean – had a point last week when she told me we are acting like “dirty devils” in this country and in this case it could actually kill us.The time has come for a dialogue about how we can call out people publicly but politelythey fail to reach basic standards of cleanliness.Looking after ourselves and being kind to each other is not simply limited to the words we use in the public domain.If you are running a business how about encouraging staff who are sick and clearly putting others at risk of infection to have the opportunity to work for a couple of days from home without feeling they are letting the side down in some way.If you are not in a good way healthwise yourself then take a couple of days off, avoid public transport and enclosed spaces with others, and realise that the world won’t come to an end while you’re recovering.If you are a parent or teacher start enforcing standards on our kids when it comes to going to the toilet and washing hands and eating.Andyou run a restaurant make sure hand sanitisers and soap are always available for customers and staff.And Nandos, I’m going to call you out here. As a very wealthy company you can afford to pay staff to make sure your restaurants are clean rather than expecting staff to do it as a favour after their shts, as a recent BBC investigation found.Your company can also most certainly afford to buy dferent mops and cleaning equipment to be used in the toilets and the kitchen, which staff have said is currently not provided.These very basic standards will help us all as a society and not just in the very urgent fight against a coronavirus pandemic.It’s about having a basic respect for each other. We all want to be healthy and so much of that starts from being clean.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sue, pictured with Harry, says she didn’t realise he was overweight until his hip collapsed. And he had to be taken to hospital for horrible, complex, surgery.Didn’t realise  Gordon Bennett, talk about the elephant in the room. I mean, literally. The kid was half the size of their house. She didn’t notice the lack of exercise and the food Harry was putting away  And the fact that he took up the entire sofa and then some Whose fault is it that Harry needed an op We have an obesity epidemic. It is almost certainly this which has caused a drop in le expectancy in our poorest areas. The first such drop for a century.But now the obesity lobby and the health professionals have decided that obesity shouldn’t be “stigmatised”. Asit were an illness just like any other.Something which happens, without the victim knowing it is happening. This is b******s, and it’s dangerous.And stigma is a useful tool in the fight against obesity.It was only when my own son, during an argument a few years back, told me I was a fat, lardy t***er that I decided to sort my weight out. I’ve put most of it back on now so I need another bout of name-calling to provoke me to more action.My point is that fat-shaming can be very useful.Because being fat isn’t good for us and nor is it good for society. It costs the NHS millions each year. It makes people’s lives a misery. It is right that it should carry a stigma. Remove the stigma and you make being fat the natural state of being, no blame attached.Oh, you’re fat. How did that happen  What terrible bad luck, but never mind. But that is very far from the truth. With the exception of that tiny minority of people who are fat as a consequence of their genes, obesity is eminently and quite easily avoidable.Its main cause, these days, is a lack of exercise. If you’re a mum or dad and your kid is looking a bit porky, get them out for a walk every day, or do some sport with them. And keep an eye on what they are eating.Maybe ration the amount of time they spend online, tapping and swiping away on their fat a***s, pausing only to swallow a bowl of Doritos.This is surely basic parenting. Looking after your kids. Becauseyou don’t do that, they will die very young indeed.And it isn’t the Government that’s to blame. Or blind chance, or bad luck. It is because of lestyle choices. That’s the important word — choices.If you take exercise and keep an eye on what you eat, you won’t get fat and your hip won’t suddenly give up the ghost and collapse.The more we insist, out of kindness, that being fat is no fault of the inidual, the bigger the problem will grow.And now,you’ll excuse me, I have to take the dog for a walk. Four miles.That will lose me about  calories, tops. So still some way to go.INCIDENTALLY, on the subject of these face masks. Me and the family are going away for a few days in April. This will require going to an AIRPORT.Awful places, airports. Full of whacko foreigners who’ve just eaten a stewed bat and wonder why they are feeling a bit under the weather.So I had the following discussion with the missus about whether we should invest in face masks . . .Her: “Trouble is, they don’t work.”Me: “The really expensive ones do, the ones with filters. So they say.”Her: “Oh, right. But we’d look like twats, wouldn’t we ”Me: “Yes, we’d look like twats. No face masks.”That’s the British way. Rather die of pneumonia than look a bit of a twat.We’ve been told that in a worst-case scenario, , British people will die. Almost all of these, according to the experts, are elderly people with serious underlying medical conditions.Just to get this risk thing into perspective – how many of those people would have died anyway, as a consequence of those medical conditions, over the next six months THE “You Can’t Say That!” brigade are at it again.This time they have banned a woman called Selina Todd, pictured, from speaking at the Oxford University International Women’s Festival.Ironically, it was a festive which SHE helped to organise.Todd is an academic and a feminist. She has been barred from speaking because transgender activists don’t like her.They accuse her of being “transphobic”, which she denies. She probably just thinks – like a lot of the population and scientic community – that men who transition to being women are still basically men.We have to fight back against this hysterical tyranny imposed on us all by a tiny, minuscule, rump of deranged activists.It is time institutions such as Oxford University stood up for the principles of freedom of speech.That they fail to do so is a national disgrace.DANNY Baker’s been talking about how the BBC “threw him under a bus.”Baker was sacked for having tweeted a joke about Harry and Meghan and their son, Archie. He was accused of racism. But I doubt there’s a less racist bloke in the country.The BBC should admit it made a big mistake.Not only was it unjust, but I really miss listening to Danny on the radio – he’s a brilliant broadcaster.So here’s a suggestion. Give him Rylan Clark-Neal’s slot on Radio . I can’t be the only person in the country who turns off as soon as I hear him speak.Baker would bring a bit of wit to a network currently lacking it.So whether I like it or not she is now part of my world. Very grateful, thank you. My le is enriched.It seems that Stace is getting tired of “trolls” telling her she’s not bringing up her kids right. Not dressing them in appropriate clothing and stuff.Can’t say I give a monkey’s one way or the other. But I’m not absolutely certain that the best way to convince people you’re an elegant and well-mannered young lady is to take a selfie while you’re laying a cable, you know And then there’s this. She’s annoyed with the trolls right now. But what about when they’ve all gone and started to annoy someone  Who will be left to look at those selfies  Apart from Stacey THERE’S outrage in Darlington over the plight of a bunch of hamsters found in a hedge. Locals are more disgusted than at any time since my band, Dangerbird, played there in .These hamsters were in plastic boxes. And one can only assume they were bred to feed snakes. They have now been liberated. So what are they going to feed the snakes Kale and mung bean risotto  I’m telling you, they won’t like that. The likely answer is mice.So why is that any better than feeding them their cousins, hamsters A spokesmouse for the British Association of Small Rodentstold me yesterday: “It’s ludicrous. Totally inconsistent.Hamsters get away with murder. Because they’ve got chubby little cheeks and are refugees from Syria.“But nobody cares about us mice. And at least we don’t spend half the bloody night running around on a wheel like a moron. Can’t stand hamsters, me.”Anyway, Bob’s half the size of Mount Everest and rushing towards us at nearly ,mph. The experts reckon it will just miss us. But they can’t be exactly sure. Bob could swing by to say hello. In which case you can wear as many face masks as you like but it won’t help you one bit.You can even follow the BBC’s excellent advice on “how to wash your hands”. .Bob won’t care. You’ll be locked away in your self-isolating chamber under the stairs. Hands smothered in Dettol. Poncey face mask bought off Amazon. Stacks of dried food to keep you through the entire spring.And then – bang!

Let’s take him seriously.True, only  Brits are confirmed to have it so far and few caught it in Britain. But that looks certain to soar until the global race for a vaccine bears fruit.It is true too that the vast majority will suffer mild symptoms. But the WHO says the percentage killed may be substantially higher than first thought. How long will the sage advice to wash our hands and stop touching our faces suffice Other nations are scrapping events and closing schools. So far our Queen has put on gloves and the Bond movie has been delayed. We may need more draconian steps sooner rather than later. And one thing is more certain:Covid- is already a monumental global economic shock and likely to worsen.CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak must listen on fuel duty . . . to Tory backbenchers, small firms and the Sun ­readers.Hiking petrol and diesel taxes, frozen for a decade thanks to our campaign, may seem trivial to Londoners with the Tube and decent buses to rely on.It may even seem logical to increase electric car take-up.The reality outside the capital, and in the former “Red Wall” regions, is it will make working people worse off, will come as a painful blow to van drivers and a bombshell for truckers.And they won’t respond by spending £, on a battery-powered runabout they’ll need to charge every few miles.They will suffer it grimly, pass on the cost to customersthey can and resent that their new Tory Chancellor, as his first act, made their lives tougher.IT’S time for some perspective on Britain’s role in mitigating climate change.From all the Extinction Rebellion protests you might imagine we were among the world’s worst polluters.

In Germany it’s  — and China and India are building scores of new coal-burning plants.Heathrow’s expansion has been halted while they build HUNDREDS of new airports.And while we introduce bans and taxes that make Britain cleaner but threaten our prosperity, the world’s mega-polluters carry on regardless.Green campaigners should target those with the worst record, not one of the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Yesterday it was revealed that thousands of Universal Credit claimants will be given a guaranteed one-off payment when they hit state pension age - fixing a loophole in the system.Campaigners had argued that the flaw pushed some elderly benefit claimants into poverty by leaving them without money for up to nine weeks.Under the new rules, the government says Universal Credit claimants who reach state pension age “will receive a run-on” of a one-off payment.Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Therese Coffey says this will benefit approximately , pensioners over the next five years.Each person will get an average of £ from the one-off payment, she said, at a cost of £million to the government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the Queen is nothingnot practical.She has learned the lessons of the unedying exits of Princess Diana and the Duchess of York from The Firm and won’t make the same mistake this time.That’s why she quite beautully told Harry:  “You are much loved and will always be welcomed back” — a line that brings tears to the eyes of a  soppy old monarchist like me.The Queen has not accepted that Megxit is permanent and probably never will. Harry needs some time away to explore and live a le where he isn’t playing second fiddle to his father and brother.Duty and the love of his country might just pull him back soon, she hopes.But perhaps the Queen hasn’t factored in the persuasiveness and passion of Meghan — a truly modern woman with very dferent plans for her husband and their “brand”.SOMETHING Kinda Woohoo as Girls Aloud fans like me got fresh hope this week.One of the main obstacles preventing the chart-topping band reuniting has been the feud between the lovely Nadine Coyle and some of the other members.But Kimberley Walsh met Nadine this week and they seemed to be getting along just fine. Of course, the real battle will be getting Cheryl Tweedy on board.Although with her last single peaking at No, I think she might be willing to kiss and make up with Nads too. As the Pussycat Dolls have proven, there’s nothing like an enormous cheque to help smooth over bitter relations.After all, a high-profile pregnancy and cute baby being born at No always lts our collective spirits, right Similar sentiments were expressed when Tony Blair and David Cameron said  their wives were expecting while PM.  The pregnancies of Kate and Meghan were widely celebrated, too.But we are  gripped by a nasty culture war driven by social media.So after the happy announcement, Twitter once again became a hateful cesspit where apparently respectable professionals found despicable ways to slag off a young woman expecting her first baby, to a man she loves, and spout pathetic conspiracy theories.Ironically, many  were  the same crew who have been banging on for  weeks about the need to be kind to those in the public eye.But those rules instituted by the London liberal keyboard warriors only applyyou have the same political views as they do.If you are a Tory or a Brexiteer, or on the right or work for a popular newspaper, you are such an abhorrent human being in the eyes of the likes of Alastair Campbell and Jameela Jamil that you can be torn to shreds without a hint of irony from the perpetrators who are no better than abusive trolls.THE idea that over-weight people need reminding that they’re the  F-wordis nonsensical.If you have been obese and still battle the bulge every day, you’ll know that being the F-word is inside your head every minute.That’s why I embrace the idea put forward in the Pledge To Eradicate Weight Stigma, by Professor Francesco Rubino, from King’s College London, that describing people as fat, overweight and obese is just as debilitating as a racial slur in .Skinny folk convincing themselves that overweight people are McDonald’s-obsessed lazy slobs is offensive and wrong.And that type of outdated approach will do nothing to solve our obesity epidemic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The level of uncertainty means it is unwise for it to attempt to settle the big questions on tax, spending and borrowing.One influential Tory source tells me that: “You can’t do spectacular, interesting stuff during corona. But you can do boring and dficult things.”The Budget will concentrate on delivering the Tories’ election promises. Inside the Treasury it has been dubbed the “Manesto Budget”.It will contain changes to ensure that more infrastructure projects are built outside London and the South East, there will be a “Union connectivity” project launched to better link up England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — expect Boris’s bridge to get a mention — it will green-light a slew of road projects, provide money for fast broadband and increase funding for research.It will also curb the entrepreneurs’ tax relief that has turned from being an encouragement to take a risk on a new business to a general form of tax relief for wealthy investors.The Budget will also seek to emphasise that, despite the undoubted, short-term disruption the coronavirus will cause, the medium-term future for the economy is pretty rosy.Unlike with the  financial crash, the economy will rebound strongly once the virus has passed.There is, though, a big debate going on in government about how much the Government should do to help iniduals and businesses through the corona downturn.The rise in the number of people in the UK who are their own boss means there are more than four million workers not entitled to sick pay.The Government will, almost certainly, offer these people more time to pay their taxes. But what more it should do is the subject of growing debate in Whitehall.One of those involved in these discussions points out: “We can’t pay for the whole gig economy for the next six months.”A minister argues that people can get an advance from universal credit within two days in urgent cases. They fear thatthe Government starts paying the wages of the self-employed, then it will be hard to see where it should stop.They point out that a plumber who earns £, a week now, will almost certainly lose money as the virus spreads. Should the State make that up Coronavirus will change the way we live over the next few months, at the very least.But the challenge for the Government is to ensure that work on everything  doesn’t cease while the country tries to fight this crisis.It still has a job of work to do to get the country ready for le outside the EU and to prepare the economy for the great changes that technology is about to bring.BORIS JOHNSON is determined to defend Priti Patel, his Home Secretary, who is facing ious allegations of bullying from civil servants.Internally, he has given short shrt to those who have suggested he distance himself from her.There is a view in Downing Street that several of the most dramatic charges against her don’t stack up.They also claim that these concerns about Patel’s behaviour were not expressed as official complaints at the time.They, “didn’t reach up at a formal level”, I’m told.No knows, though, that it has a fight on its hands to save Patel.One source tells me: “Yes, she can survive. But there’s no smoke without fire. It is shaping up to be quite a big struggle.”Part of the issue is that there is a view among senior civil servants that, given that the top civil servant at the Home Office has quit because of this row, Patel should go too.But Downing Street know thatPatel goes, it would become harder to push reform through the system.One of those at the heart of government tells me: “You can’t have a situation where civil servants get to determine who their Secretary of State is.”The next hurdle for Patel to clear is Sir Alex Allan’s inquiry into whether her behaviour breached the ministerial code.There is a quiet confidence among her allies that while she will receive some criticism from his report, she won’t be found guilty of breaching the code.Buther former Permanent Secretary Sir Philip Rutnam really is determined to take his case to an employment tribunal, then the situation will become far more dficult for the Home Secretary.THERE’S a new political ide: Do you still shake hands or have you started bumping elbows to try to reduce your risk of contacting coronavirus Boris Johnson is still very much a hand-shaker, as is the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.But some other Cabinet ministers have taken to either nodding politely or bumping elbows.As one of those close to the talks put it: “We’ve told them what we think. Their illusions are disappearing rapidly.”The question now is whether when the EU negotiators turn up in London in less than two weeks’ time, they come with a dferent approach or carry on pushing these ideas.THE local elections in May might have to be postponed because of coronavirus.If the UK’s response to the outbreak is still in the delay phase, continuing with the contests would go against that advice, as it would bring large numbers of people into contact with each other.I understand this option is being discussed in Whitehall, but no decision has been taken.But as one figure in government points out: “We postponed a General Election once because of an epidemic.”The  General Election was pushed back to June from May because of foot-and-mouth disease.Delaying the elections – which will see mayors elected in London, the West Midlands and Manchester among other races – would be a big step, and one the Government would only take with the utmost reluctance.The next few weeks will tell us whether it is necessary or not.- James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In a letter to the Commons Environment committee, Environment minister Lord Goldsmith said the department was committed to cracking down on the abhorrent practice. But he admitted UK Border Force had not published formal targets for the interception of smuggled pets. And no specic funding has been provided to Border Force or local authorities to tackle the trade in the last five years. Neil Parish, Chair of the committee said: Whilst DEFRA clearly support the Committeeaposs views on this horrible practice, it needs to put its money where its mouth is. “If we really want puppies to be protected, there need to be sensible pet travel regulations, and authorities need to be given appropriate funding and powers to stop smugglers. Lord Goldsmith has launched a £, campaign to raise awareness of unscrupulous sellers of puppies and kittens. The strategy - dubbed ‘Petfished’ - launched last week, urging consumers to make conscious and responsible choices when purchasing pets. But the Committee also raised concerns about the minimum age requirement for puppies to travel - arguing this should be raised from  weeks to six months. Lord Goldsmith said there were “no current plans” to change the law, but claimed Brexit could allow for more “robust controls” in the future.

Each month they ask primary school pupils to send in designs for specic briefs, like aposcrazy new vehiclesapos.Once an idea is selected the inventive duo set out to build a real-le version of it that actually works, while filming the whole process.Their slime canon car was one of their first big hits.The idea was sent in by an eight-year-old and featured a car with a roof canon that spewed out edible gunge. In the video they explain to viewers, in simple terms, how the structure will be built and what it takes to pump slime through a nozzle. They then made the edible gunk out of water, flour, icing sugar, white sugar, marshmallows, food colouring and sprinkles. An electric pump was attached to a rotating plate, made using a wheel-bearing, and all of that was mounted on an electric raising  that bursts through the roof of the car at the touch of a button. In another video they built the aposworldaposs first popcorn firing doorbellapos, where a leaf blower is used to send popcorn flying out of a letter box at the touch of the doorbell.Ruth says that the pair are keen to encourage the younger generation to embrace their creativity whilst also learning some basics about engineering and building. Itaposs a great first look into the world of engineering for children, it engages them with learning by having fun, she said. We want to show how fun engineering is. Their videos are appealing to both adults and kids who have the creative bug. The channel has currently racked up , subscribers and their most popular video has over , views. Shawn is an engineer and designer who has previously created his own energy products. He also helped bring the UKaposs largest mechanical puppet, aposThe Man Engineapos, to le. Heaposs an accomplished public speaker and his Tedx talk, aposNeuroersity: an untapped resource for future inventorsapos offers a compelling case for teaching children with learning dficulties in a way that best suits them. Ruth first featured in the media as a teenager after inventing a handrail to help those who struggle to climb the stairs. The StairSteady is a patented design that Ruth created in her Design and Technology GCSE lessons. The brief was to design something to solve a problem and Ruth decided to set to work on something to help her teacheraposs mother, who couldnapost climb the stairs but didnapost want a stairlt. Initially, just wanting to do a good job was the only thing on Ruthaposs mind, but she soon gained the interest of a local company who helped her produce a prototype.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum has spoken out about how her autistic son, , was bullied so severely she had to pull him out of school. Leanne Fernandez, , whose son Harrison also lives with aspergeraposs syndrome, says he was beaten by a group of classmates at Colchester Academy every day for nearly three months.It meant he regularly came home in tears and unable to understand why he was being picked on, also led to him self-harming, Essex Live reports.Four of the incidents were so horric that they had to be reported to police, eventually leaving Leanne feeling it was no longer safe for her son to attend school. As a result, Harrison has not attended classes since November. The bullying - initially verbal - started within hour of Harrisonaposs first day at secondary school on September  last year, Leanne says. Obviously it all started off verbally with them saying he was gay, he walked gay, he looked gay, he talked gay, she explains. But on the second day, it escalated to physical. They tried apospeanut-ingapos the tie and it came off and they started pushing him and it continued out of school. He has had orange juice poured down the back of his neck, food taken away from him, had three of them pushing him at one time. Over the next following weeks, the violence escalated, leaving Harrison - who had started secondary school keen to make friends and learn - with a bruised and swollen face, ripped clothes and bloodied knees.  A group of boys regularly targeted her son on a daily basis, Leanne claims, including waiting to catch him in between classes and punch him in the groin. They would also make threats. One child threatened him when he saw him and said aposwe are looking for you and said aposwe are going to stamp on your skullapos. Thataposs not a normal thing for a -year-old to say, she continued. It is really upsetting for him. He had just started school and he is asking aposwhy they have they got a problem with me apos When you go in to school every single day and a number of them are going up to him between classes punching him in the groin. Itaposs awful.  Leanne first contacted police on September , telling them that on the third day of year seven Harrison had been physically hurt. She called officers again on September , and told them he was beaten by another child. They were called again for a third incident on September  when Leanne had picked him up from school. She was a little late and asked him to meet her in the car park, just outside the school. She said: I pulled up in the car park and I said come out of reception to the car and he said yes. While I was waiting for him, they beat him up. They had waited outside reception for him.  Iaposm sat thinking heaposs waiting in reception but actually heaposs getting beaten up. Leanne said the school had given Harrison early passes so he could leave class and school early. The aim, she said, was that he could try and avoid bullies travelling to other classes, or them catching him at the end of the day. He would also be sent to the sensory room or the library at break times or lunch times, in the hope to keep him away from the bullies. He was even being told to go there break and lunch times so they didnapost hurt him, she said. He had to go classes five minutes earlier than the others so that he could get there before them or they would punch him in the groin. He would come home and cry and say itaposs too much to handle. He just wants to go to school. Heaposs been beaten to a pulp. Harrison retaliated to the bullies and punched back after everything became too much. Harrison punched back once because he had had enough. But he never stuck up for himself again because he didnapost want to get in trouble and then it was worse because he was just getting pure beaten, Leanne said. But the final straw was on November , when she called police for a final time. He was going to the library or sensory room to eat his lunch and as he went down the stairwell and there were five of them waiting for him, she stated. One boy rushed up to him put him in a head lock so he was facing down and kept punching him. He then went crying and rushed to the toilet. They kept him in the toilet and he said a teacher was standing guard of it. They didnapost get the boys and take them to a room. Why didnapost they take him to the medical bay  Even though pupils arenapost allowed phones at school, Leanne had given Harrison one in case he got hurt again. She says that he texted her a picture from inside the toilet, with a picture of his face already swollen. He messaged her, aposMum theyaposve really hurt me, Iaposm scared.apos Leanne, who works as a child minder, says she had to pack up her and the kids as quickly as possible and contact their parents to tell them she was going to get her son. The effect everything has had on Harrison has been huge. Thereaposs been so many failings, itaposs ridiculous. I said no more, he couldnapost be there without harm, the mum claimed.He has a doctoraposs note to say itaposs detrimental effect to be in school. Because of his needs, like his  OCD , which is not flicking light switches itaposs his thoughts, he is a perfectionist and has severe anxiety so he takes it all out on himself.He self harms for not being perfect. He struggles with himself anyway, so with this he is coming home thinking heaposs in trouble, no one likes him and heaposs not good enough. He just wants some friends. Children with autism struggle with social things anyway and feel isolated so to not go to school and be at home with me alone all day is not good. He only gets two hours of learning. His mother has fought for him to attend another school - and Harrison is now due to start at the Phillip Morant School, also in Colchester, next week. Colchester Academy says that keeping its student safe is its highest priority. Principal Jenny Betts said: I cannot comment on inidual cases. However, keeping our students safe is our highest priority, which includes dealing swtly with any incidents of alleged bullying.  We follow clear behavioural procedures and use any appropriate sanctions we have available.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailLittle Oscar Casey knows when his dad has run out of money - he opens the fridge and it is empty. But Oscar knows they will never go hungry - thanks to the work of the L community centre. In the shadow of Everton FC’s Goodison Park ground, it’s a leline for thousands of families like Oscar’s. It runs a food bank, a baby bank, a school unorm “shop”, a youth club, holiday club, a free launderette and much, much more. Without the L - which gets no government funding at all, relying instead on grants, donations and fundraising - thousands of families would literally not be able to survive.Oscar spoke to the Mirror as we launch our Give Me Five campaign . We are calling on Boris Johnson to increase child benefit by £ a week to end the scourge of child poverty.Oscar, eight, says: “I love coming here as I get to play with my friends. And the food is really good - my favourite tea is Shepherd’s Pie. “I know my dad only gets money on a Thursday and sometimes he runs out. I open the fridge sometimes and there is no food. If he got an extra £ a week he would be able to get more shopping in for us.” Oscar’s dad Danny is one of L’s success stories. Eight years ago he was drinking, taking drugs, living on the streets - and his newborn son was on the verge of being adopted. But with the support of L’s chief executive Gerard Woodhouse, Danny managed to turn his le around - and get custody of his son. Gerard says: “Nothing shocks me any more. I’ve known families go without food for five days before coming to us for help. We buy beds for children who have been sleeping on the sofa or a mattress on the floor because their parents can’t afford to buy them a bed. “We are just a community centre - we should be putting on ballroom dancing, bingo and youth clubs. But instead  per cent of the work we do is around poverty. “Last year we made almost , donations of food, clothes, toys and hampers. We sent out , Christmas dinners. On Christmas Eve we open until midnight because people who have been too proud to ask for help before then panic and come to us as they have nothing to give their kids for Christmas. “I remember two years ago we got a call late Christmas Eve - we went round and the family had nothing. And the saddest thing was the kids had drawn a Christmas tree on the wall because they couldn’t afford to buy a tree. “I came back to the centre, took down all our decorations and took them round to that family’s house, along with toys and food.” We spent the day at the centre to see first-hand the work they do on the very frontline of Britain’s poverty crisis. It is am on Monday morning and there is a queue of people snaking around the L building. It is the first day of the centre’s new food union project - where people can pay £. and choose  “luxury” items of shopping. Things that most of us would see as bare essentials are classed as luxuries here - toilet roll, shampoo, nappies, sanitary products, toothpaste. These are things that parents would otherwise have to go withoutthey want to feed their children. Families have to make tough choices here - feed their kids, or heat their home, or buy toilet roll. Gerard says: “I had one little boy in here the other day. He ran straight to the loo and was in and out in a minute. I said to him “that was quick” and he said I just had to go in and wipe my bum as we have no loo roll at home.” That is the stark reality of how tough things are for people around here. Gerard decided to launch the food union as he knows that out of pride people are reluctant to go to a food bank. This way they get to make a contribution to their shopping and don’t feel like they are accepting charity. Looking through the centre’s referral files - where teachers, doctors and social workers refer families in desperate of need of help - makes sobering reading. Family after family unable to feed their children due to changes in their benefits, working parents unable to make ends meet, women fleeing domestic violence.And two words keep being repeated over and over again..... Universal Credit . Since the introduction of the controversial benefit, the L has seen a  percent increase in referrals. Universal Credit was rolled out in Liverpool in December , and since then delays in payments, sanctions and reduction of benefits have all taken their toll. Gerard says: “The payment now goes to one person in the household. Sothe dad misses an appointment at the job centre, the whole family’s money can be stopped. For me,the dad does something wrong, stop his money, but don’t stop the money for the kids. “In this area  per cent of working people are still living in poverty. A lot of our mothers are proud to work - but they are on zero hours contracts so they don’t know how much money they will be earning from one month to the next. They might sign their child up for a school trip - but then the next month their hours get cut and they can’t afford it.” But Universal Credit and zero hours contracts aren’t the only problem in Liverpool Six. Gerard says the area is re with loan sharks who prey on the most vulnerable, and drug abuse is also a big issue. He says: “The loan sharks all have their own patches -  streets each - and the don’t stray onto each other’s patch. We had one woman who took out a £ loan - which with interest then spiralled to £,. She was forced into prostitution to try to pay it back and provide for her kids. “Drugs are so cheap - they can get a hit for a tenner. You see the drug dealers waiting on the corner outside school for the parents after they have dropped their kids off. They wait outside the local shops, the post office - first thing in the morning when people have taken their money out.”Gerard says that another major fear for mums in this area is having their children removed by social services.He says: “I went to a safeguarding meeting last week where they were worried because the mum wasn’t taking her baby with her to school when she dropped her older children off. I asked her why she wasn’t taking the baby with her - it was because she didn’t have a pram.” One desperate mum-to-be has come to the centre for help this morning. Rosemary Connolly, , is seven months months pregnant, her boyfriend has been jailed and she doesn’t have a single thing ready for her baby girl’s arrival - no cot, no pram, not even a baby bottle - and she has no money to buy anything. She explains: “I’ve only got  weeks until my baby is due but I haven’t got a thing. My boyfriend just smoked weed all the time - that’s where all his money and my money went. “I get £ a fortnight benefits but that is to pay for everything - food, electricity, travel. I can barely survive day to day on that - never mind having to try to pay for all the stuff you need for a baby. “I’ve offended in the past and I could go out and shoplt the stuff but I’d be terried of getting caught and having my baby taken away. “There are times when I’ve had to miss meals because I’ve got no money - I think that is why my baby bump is so small. “I’ve had pre-eclampsia because of the stress - I was terried of going into labour and not having the stuff for the baby. You don’t want to admit to anyone that you’ve got nothing - you don’t want people to judge you or look down on you.”  The centre has its own “baby bank” - a shipping container in the car park filled to the brim with everything a new mum would need for her baby - all brand new. Volunteer Irene Rainey helps Rosemary pick out everything she needs for her baby girl - who she is going to call Fleur - from a cot, pram and car seat, down to vests, nappies and babygros. Rosemary’s eyes fills with tears as she is handed £, worth of essentials for her unborn child. She says: “I just feel so relieved to have been able to come here - it is like a weight lted from me. I feel like Gerard is myangel. I’m crying now because I am so relieved and grateful. I feel like I’ve won the lottery.” Irene also runs the centre’s “unorm shop” - another shipping container full of school unorms from dozens of pairs of brand new school shoes, to winter coats, PE kits, and branded school sweatshirts. Every child referred can get £ worth of brand new unorm - and last year the centre kitted out almost , children - with  per cent of those being kids whose parents work on zero hour contracts. Irene explains: “Some of them are in desperate situations through no fault of their own. “There are mums who have four or five kids but can’t feed them as they have been waiting eight weeks for their universal credit. “They have to get those kids to school somehow but can barely feed them.  “We make sure that those children all have a brand new school unorm. At the start of a school term we hand out hundreds of unorms, hundreds. I don’t see this as charity though. It is a community coming together to support each other, look out for each other. Shoplting is a another huge problem in this area - desperate, poverty-stricken parents feel they have no choice but to steal basic items like nappies, sanitary products and toothpaste. So Gerard and the local supermarket devised a scheme where the store would not prosecute parents caught stealing those basic items - as long as they agreed to attend a course at L. Gerard says: “People stealing food or nappies, orthey tell the store that they have stolen because they needed to sell it to pay for something , then the store agreed not to prosecutethey engaged with us. “We work with them, we tell them what is right and wrong, then we check all their benefits. We get them doing cooking, how to make healthy meals on a budget, they cook for the youth club. Then we get them volunteering in the centre. About  people have been through this scheme so far and it has been successful.”  At pm the youth club opens and children come straight from school for activities - and more importantly food and warmth. Gerard says: “ it wasn’t for this club, some of these kids might not get a hot meal tonight. There wouldn’t be any heating on at home and most likely they would be hanging out in the streets. “The parents like their kids coming here because they know they are safe, warm and fed.” In the summer holidays many families reach crisis point with no school breakfast clubs or free school meals to fill the kids bellies.  L steps in and cooks around  breakfasts each day,  two course lunches and then they send the kids home with an evening meal as well. The centre has a launderette and around  families a week come into do their laundry for free. Gerard says: “They don’t even have to pay for washing powder. We have had kids come here who smell because their clothes are dirty and other kids can be very cruel. So we always make sure that kids have access to clean clothes. “Nothing surprises me any more - people will come in and say they have seen kids in the bins outside looking for food. That is just normal here now. It is another world and the sad fact is that there are lots of places like this.” aposI don’t want him to go withoutapos  Oscar’s dad Danny Casey says: “When I was  I found my mum dead in bed, but two weeks before that I had found out that the man who brought me up wasn’t my dad. So I was left on my own. My brother died a year later when he was , so then I went off the rails. Taking drugs, drinking, I became homeless and lived on the streets for two years. “I started robbing out of shops to survive, and then I met Gerard and he took me in. But I didn’t change - I was still doing drugs, I used to steal off him, I treated him terribly. “But then I got to the age of  and I realised I was either going to die or end up in jail. Then I got a letter from the courts saying my ex-girlfriend was pregnant and the baby was going to be put up for adoption. “It was the wake-up call I needed, I knew I had to fight for my son - I haven’t touched a single drug since. I had to go for weekly drug tests, I had to do parenting classes - I would be the only male in the room. “Eventually I got him back when he was eight months old. It was amazing - I have never cried so much in my le. But I couldn’t have done it without the support of Gerard, Everton Nursery and the L. They still support me to this day. “The poverty we are going through at the minute is just ridiculous - people just can’t survive.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA coronavirus expert has said the fight against a global pandemic is like being aposat warapos with the virus. CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations Dr Richard Hatchett said the virus had the potential to spread to % of the population worldwide. He said: I think the threat is very signicant. The potential of the virus is demonstrated in china and demonstrated in Italy and Iran. There were three cases in Italy two weeks ago - yesterday there were over ,. Speaking about how China has responded to the outbreak, he said: It is like they are at war with the virus - all of society is mobilised in the fight against the virus. On the UKaposs fight to halt the spread, he added: We have to recognise the virus is here and it has tremendous potential to be disruptive and to cause high rates of illness or even death - but that is not a future that is locked in. Contact tracing is very imp - voluntary quarantine of contacts and isolation of cases is very imp - there may be a time to close schools. We know that schools are amplication points in society - attack rates are much higher in children and the elderly. Children have been minimally affected by COVID- whats unclear is whether they have been infected and handled the infections well or maybe they are not being affected. Dr Hatchett suggested the virus may have been in the UK for weeks before it was detected. He added: If you look at places where death has occurred - England now falls into that category - a death signies circulation of the virus that has been going on for at least weeks.  It takes time for people to get sick, go to the hospital and expire - the virus has been circulating here for some time. I think the most concerning thing is the combination of infectiousness and the ability to cause disease and death. Not since , the Spanish flu - have we seen a virus combining these qualities in this way. What happens with this virus is up to us - I do think this has the potential to cause a global pandemic. To tackle the spread, Dr Hatchett said we need to work collectively as a society in our prevention and not think of our own, personal risk only. He added: We need to start thinking of the social risk- we need to all think about our responsibility to each other. We cant view the epidemic in terms of our person risk- we need to act collectively.

Mira Amin, , and her partner Lloyd Price, , now wipe down everything that comes into their home with antibacterial wipes, use boiled water to do their washing up and only venture outside to go to grocery shopping. The pair have spent nearly two weeks confined to their flat in Changwon, where they moved in December to start a new le teaching English abroad. They had only been in the country a matter of weeks when the outbreak of the potentially deadly COVID- struck - forcing them to disinfect their home, sterilise their clothes, and go into self-quarantine. The number of coronavirus cases in South Korea exceeded , this week.  Speaking to Wales Online , Mia said: I first heard about the novel coronavirus during the middle of January.The Korean news began to report on the break out in Wuhan. Initially I was unsure of how to react. Korea is clearly very close to China but information about the effects of the virus were very mixed. Gradually children and staff at the school started wearing masks more frequently than usual then we were told to start wearing masks around mid-February. At this point the school put hand sanitiser at the entrance door and more and more concerned conversations about the virus could be heard around Changwon city.  In truth I downplayed the seriousness of the issue as I wanted to enjoy my le in a new country and also I felt sceptical of how western media reports on China as it is often prone to be sensationalist. I passed it off as something you just watch happening from a screen. Then it happened here, right on our street. Mira and Lloyd decided to work abroad on New Year’s Day in  and applied to teach in South Korea after a recommendation from a friend who lived there. They were later hired by a company who were seeking a couple to teach at its school. When they moved to Changwon in December, they were given an apartment and settled into le and work as English as a second languageteachers fairly quickly.  But within weeks le changed. A few weeks ago, Mira says she saw a quarantine container being delivered to a hospital located opposite their apartment. They noticed the evening was quieter than usual and due to them being limited with their understanding of the local language they didnapost really know what was going on. This was when we realised something was very wrong, she said. We were told to self-quarantine as the virus had reached our city. Our lestyle changed overnight – we were told to only drink bottled or boiled water.  With very little information about the virus we both disinfected our home immediately, sterilised our clothes, and set up a quarantine. By Friday Mira and Lloyd were on day  of self-quarantine. At first it was a shock to our system, she said. Essentially you are confined but at the same time you have the freedom to do what you want within four walls. As a wellbeing advocate I knew I had to keep my mind and body busy so I started a blog to turn my boredom into creativity and also to reach out to others in the same situation.I had no idea I would make virtual friends from this who I hope to meet when this thing blows over. I try to limit my time watching Netflix . I plan each day out – YouTube yoga sessions, blogging, call friends and family, and we’ve even started doing jigsaw puzzles.I’m a very outgoing person so some days I look outside and wonder when things are going to go back to normal. Of course I really want to get back out in the city exploring and discovering new things like we were but I know this will take time. Iaposm grateful to have my partner with me to annoy and talk to – hence why I created the term Quaranteam on my blog hoping to create an online community for others in the same boat. It’s a surreal situation. There are so many ex-pats and other ESL teachers here confined and living alone. Mira said peopleaposs lives have been impacted heavily as they are unable to work, children are missing out on their education, and people are longing for things to get back to normal. She said even though itaposs been surreal the experience has made the pair appreciate being out more and they are planning lots of exciting things when they can finally leave the apartment. Like many places around around the world South Korea is now covered with posters offering information about the virus and there is hand sanitiser in most places for the public. People wearing masks is also a common sight. Mira said: We are without a car here. Our school director kindly delivered us groceries to see us through the week when this first happened and another colleague recently delivered us masks as my partner couldn’t find any locally. Anything we receive is wiped down with an anti-bacterial wipe. In our home we have our own procedure happening that we quickly had to adapt to. When we have to make a quick trip to the local store to top up supplies and groceries we have to wear masks. We make the trip to the nearest store and we make it as quick as possible. We take antibacterial hand wipes to open doors and to make payments. We remove our shoes before entering the home. That is a common thing in Asia but now we actually disinfect the soles of our shoes. We then wipe down our clothes with antibacterial wipes and sanitise our hands before entering the living area. One of us stays by the door and disinfects grocery packaging whilst the other puts them in storage. When we wake up every morning we have a routine of filling a large bowl with boiled water from the kettle. We use this water for everything from washing vegetables to washing our mouths and faces. We top the bowl up throughout the day. When we wash our dishes and cutlery we sterilise them in boiled, hot water. Itaposs a nuisance but it has to be done. People are worried here. Mira explained the concern in the country was more for the elderly and children. Like many Asian cultures the elderly play a vital role in family dynamics and their protection is important. Mira said the government was doing everything in its power to get things back to normal and to help people and was on -hour alert. It has set up drive-through clinics and there are free tests and treatment for everyone regardless of residential status. The teacher said small business have been affected, education establishments have closed, and events have been cancelled but the people are very resilient. She said: The government makes a serious effort in keeping the public aware of all case details and preventative measures taking place. They are very open with their communication and there has been an absolute community effort to help each other stay safe here. Our teaching contract ends in December . Many ESL teachers have made the choice to leave but we couldn’t think of anything worse than being stuck at an airport right now – let alone travelling  hours in a plane.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailScientists around the world are working together in the race to find a coronavirus vaccine although it is feared it could take at least a year. Researchers at Imperial College London and Oxford and Cam­­bridge universities are among the experts toiling around the clock. Imperial have prototypes in early trials and will move to human trials as early as next month. The college’s Prof Robin Shattock said: “We have the technology to generate a vaccine with a speed that’s never been realised before. “Most vaccines take five years in the discovery phase and at least one to two years to manufacture and get into clinical trials. “We are trying to short-track that and we may not be the first – it requires only one group to get there.”  In America, Seattle biotech firm Moderna is recruiting  volunteers to test its experimental vaccine and in Pennsylvania Inovio is developing a DNA-based vac­­cine, producing , doses for trials next month. In India, Zydus Cadila aims to manipulate a measles virus to produce antibodies against corona while in China four teams are using immune-activating technology from a Florida firm. Denmark’s Expresion is using insect cells to tackle the problem while researchers in Queensland, Aus­­tralia, are using a “molecular clamp”.  PM Boris John­­son yesterday pled­ged a fur­­ther £mil­­lion for research to fight the virus. He announ­­­ced the fund­ing during a tour of the Mol­­ogic lab in Bed­­fordshire which is working on a quick and cheap way to diagnose patients. In a statement he said: “Keeping people safe is my number one priority and that’s why I’ve set out our four-part plan to contain, delay, mitigate and research coronavirus.  “We are ensuring the country is prepared for the current outbreak, guided by the science at every stage. But we also need to invest in researching the vaccines that could prevent future outbreaks. “I’m very proud that UK experts – backed by Government funding – are on the front line of global efforts to do just that.” Speaking to reporters, Mr Johnson added: “What we are announcing today is a £million package of investment which will in time deliver a vaccine – some say in about a year – but also help us to have rapid test kits that anyone can use quickly to tell whether they have coronavirus.”  The PM warned of a “substantial period of disruption”. Asked what help would be given to struggling firms, he said next week’s budget presented “a big opportunity”. Scientists have learned lessons from previous virus outbreaks – such as the  Sars crisis – and already had a game plan when the full gravity of corona emerged. Within days of the outbreak in China a genetic blueprint of the virus was put online using samples from early patients. It provided a road map for scientists around the world to create a vaccine.  This kind of research is usually highly competitive and secretive. In the past, medical journals would only publish research which was exclusive. But with this outbreak they have promised that sharing data online will not hinder later publication.  As a consequence dozens of teams around the world are collaborating in a way never before seen. For decades, the main way of creating a vaccine has been by using the original virus. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, for example, uses weakened versions of those bugs.  But work on coronavirus uses newer, faster approaches including lting small sections of the virus’s genetic code and putting them into other, harmless, infections. Oxford University is using a technique it was already working on to combat Mers. Other experts are pinning their hopes on repurposing drugs used to fight HIV and malaria which have already gone through safety checks.  Remdesivir, used against Ebola, is also being tested. Moderna’s Seattle project is being work­­ed on by  people. Boss Richard Hatchett said: “After our call for proposals in February we had  applications from all over the world. “There is a real urgency because the threat is unprecedented in  years.” Even so, creating a vaccine remains a y process due to the cost and labour, plus the need for testing. It took years to develop a vaccine for Ebola, which killed more than , in West Africa just over a decade ago. Experts believe a viable coronavirus vaccine is a year to  months away, which may sound a long time but would in fact be a new record.

Here in an exclusive extract from his new book, Long Way Home, he recalls some moments that helped shape him... I wouldn’t necessarily recommend the coping box as a strategy for others but it somehow saw me through the toughest of times. It was a Colour Sergeant who ­introduced us to the concept. He said: “The way I’ve always got myself through is by putting all my worries in a box – what I call a coping box. “When you’re in the heat of an ­operation, when your mates are being killed and maimed, you don’t have time to grieve, don’t have time to think too deeply about what’s happening. “You just have to get on with it. Better to store it all away in that box and deal with it later. “When you get back, maybe then you can open it up and deal with it.” I first used it in the war in Kosovo. We were dropped by helicopter into an area that had been occupied by Serbian forces. There was something about the place that immediately struck me as not being right. I just got a sense that we had arrived at somewhere that had witnessed horrors. As we neared the village we saw a young woman walking towards us. There was a terrible sadness in her dark eyes and a haunted expression on her face. I couldn’t tellshe was afraid of us or of who had been there before. Or both. As I was considering whether to call to her, there was a message from the lead section that they had found something. I watched the woman disappear like a ghost into the trees. Called forward to ­examine the find, I ­discovered it was a pit about the size of a single-decker bus on its side. It had been covered with a mound of earth. It looked like it might be a mass grave. I walked cautiously up to it, wonderingit might be booby-trapped, and knelt beside it. Something smelt very bad. Then something caught my eye – protruding out of the mound a couple of metres on from where I was. I could feel my heart pumping. I looked more closely. There could be no mistake – it was a human hand sticking out of the dirt. I edged closer, my eyes fixed upon it.  On the wrist of the hand was a watch. It was still ticking. I wondered about the woman I passed earlier. What horrors might she have witnessed or suffered  I tried not to think about the watch, or the hand, or what was attached to it, and what  was hidden in the mound. I tried to put out of my mind the very distinctive stench of death and the haunted young woman’s face. Into the coping box it all went and I got on with what we were doing. After the war, le carried on and deployments around the world followed. Then, in , I met Caroline. I fell in love very quickly and it wasn’t long before I asked her to marry me. Over the next few years we had a son and daughter and while le in the Army with two small kids was rarely quiet, we were happy and hope­ful. But in April  the unimaginable happened: Caroline was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Although we had come to understand there was some minor problem, the thought it might be cancer just hadn’t crossed our minds. And now, from nowhere, completely unexpectedly, the C-word was being used. Caroline was very upset but quickly regained her composure. I had decided to be as ruthlessly positive as I could possibly be. I didn’t want to unmask the terrible fear I felt be­­­cause I knew I had to be strong for her.  We agreed both to stay as positive as possible. I tried to cope by being useful and keeping busy. But I was angry. Angry that Caroline, of all people, was having to go through this ordeal. I was desperately frustrated that there wasn’t anything I could really do to make it go away. There was an all-consuming feeling of powerlessness and it proved very dficult to manage. For once I didn’t feel I could just put it in my coping box. Surgeons thought an operation had got all the cancer but in  it ­­re­­­­- turned. Chemotherapy was prescribed and Caroline began a punishing routine which continued until early . Her health continued to deteriorate. I never ever gave up but there came a moment when I had to acknowledge where this was leading. I had to start accepting that the cancer was probably going to win. That it would take her from me. That I would lose her. That I would be left on my own with the kids. I had always looked around the cor­­­ner to think about what was coming next and to try and get ready for it. But, for the first time, I couldn’t bear to look round that next corner, nor was I able to shove it in my coping box. Maybe the box was full or maybe this didn’t belong in the box. I don’t know which – I just knew I couldn’t discard the worry in the way I always had. I steeled myself. The final few weeks were awful. I was caring for Caroline at home with support from a nurse who came in every day.  We strove to maintain the normal routine with me getting the kids ready for school and then bringing Caroline downstairs, where I would make her as comfortable as possible. On a beautully fresh summer’s morning at the end of June we made it out into the garden and sat in deckchairs with a coffee. Caroline had her sunglasses on and, despite everything she had endured, was still beautul, graceful and delightful company. We enjoyed the sunshine and each other’s company and I took the opportunity to tell her how much I loved her. Caroline noticed a stirring in the little rose bed by the side of the house. It was a mole. Gradually it worked its way to the surface and popped its sleepy head out. It paused, asto enjoy the lovely sunshine, before deciding that it was perhaps better off underground. ­ Caroline recounted the tale to the children when they ed from school and was as excited to tell them about it as they were to hear it. It was the last time I saw her smile. In the weeks that followed she declined with terrying speed.  On a Friday morning in July Caroline became very short of breath. An ambulance came and took her away. I sat by her hospital bedside for several hours. All day I could see and feel Caroline sliding away. I sat holding her hand all night and for most of the following day. That afternoon I could feel her going and at .pm she died. I had no idea what to do. I sat with her for a while. Despite all the time I had spent thinking about it, trying to prepare myself for this moment, I wasn’t ready. Eventually, I thanked the staff for their care and walked slowly out. I was holding a small plastic bag containing Caroline’s belongings – her dressing gown and a washbag I’d made up with a few toiletries. I’d arrived at the hospital with my we.

Locals complain that the road, built  years ago, is now full of vehicle parts, industrial waste and domestic trash. Brian Miles said: “It’s horrendous. There is thousands upon thousands of tonnes of waste and it just grows. Nothing ever gets taken away. “Everything you can imagine is down there… remnants of a beauty salon, advertising hoardings, domestic waste, building waste and tyres.” The only thing he has seen the road used for, apart from dumping trash, was to film sequences for BBC’s Doctor Who. The road off the A in Coedkernew, South Wales, was built during the development of the Imperial Park estate when electronics firm LG set up its factory in Newport with a promise of more than , jobs. The plant has since closed. Mr Miles, chairman of Wentlooge Community Council, says he has repeatedly raised the dumping with authorities but it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for the land. He added: “There’s rats everywhere. People are up in arms about it.” Newport city council is listed as sole owner of the land at HM Land Registry. The council declined to confirm this.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum gave birth in the passenger seat of a Ford Focus as her partner drove at mph down a country lane in a frantic effort to get her to hospital. Amy Russell, , said her heart still speeds up as she recalls Dan Hornsey, , speeding through North Devon before their daugher Elsie was born. Panicked Dan said he saw a big, red slimy ball poking between Amyaposs legs, and was horried to learn it was the babyaposs head. Amy said, Wales Online reports: “I told Dan I needed to take my trousers down.” She continued: “He thought I was joking, but I felt like I had to push and you can’t stop that from happening. “I knew whether we got to hospital or not that our baby was coming there and then!” At that point they were closer to Tiverton and District Hospital, which was  minutes nearer than Exeter, so Dan decided the best thing he could do was try to make it there, even though no one was expecting them. He said: “I didn’t stop or pull over, because I knew I was close to the hospital. “I also knew I could get there before an ambulance would find us in the Devon lanes.” Then Dan glanced over and saw “a big, red, slimy ball” poking out between Amy’s legs. “I panicked a bit when I saw that and Amy told me it was the baby’s head,” he said.  “It was crazy. “I looked back at the road briefly and I then looked back to see Amy pulling Elsie out, which was when I realised she was delivering the baby herself. “Amy was strapped in with a seatbelt, Elsie was lying on her lap and the umbilical cord was still attached, so I was really panicking.”  He continued: “I had my hand on the horn, the headlights flashing and when we got to the hospital, where nobody was expecting us because we were supposed to go to Exeter, I was about a metre away from driving through the front door!” Amy, who is also mum to Hope, five, her daughter from a previous relationship, remembers waking up on the morning of December , , two days before her due date, feeling pain reminiscent of contractions. A full-time mum, she said: “It felt like I was having contractions but my waters hadn’t broken, so I called the midwe who said everything was perfectly normal.” Amy continued: “She suggested I have a hot bath, which would either speed things up or slow things down, so I went to run it, but never actually had one.” Meanwhile, Dan went to wake Hope, reassuring her that her mum was fine, but had a few tummy  pains, so she needed to get up and go to her grandparents’ house soon.  “I was just talking to Hope, nice and chilled, when Amy stuck her head around the door about  minutes in and said, ‘Dan, I need to talk to you,’” he recalled. While her waters still had not broken, before she could climb into the bath her mucus plug – which blocks the cervix during pregnancy – had come out, which usually indicates labour will follow shortly. “I wasn’t expecting to hear that, so that’s probably when I felt the first small panic,” said Dan. “I called my dad, Dave, who picked Hope up to take her to Nana Cyndi’s, then we phoned Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, where we were scheduled to give birth.” He continued: “They asked how far away we were, and when we said a  or  minute drive, they said that was fine and I started packing the car, so we could drive there. “When I went back to the house, Amy was on all fours in the hallway having a bad contraction, but because she stayed so calm, so did I.”  But Amy, a former carer, admits the contractions were much worse than she had let on. She said: “I wasn’t sure I would even make it to the car. How I got up off the floor and managed to get into the car I just don’t know. “I knew I needed to make sure Dan was calm, so he could drive safely, though. “Andthere’s one thing I learnt from this experience, it’s that Dan is an excellent driver!” The couple, who had been together for a year and knew they were having a girl, then set off to drive through the twisty Devon lanes in the rain to Exeter. As Amy’s contractions worsened, however, Dan had a change of plan. He said:  “Amy’s contractions started getting stronger, more painful and more frequent, until she said to me, ‘I don’t think we’re going to make it to Exeter.apos”  He added: “A bit of panic started kicking in and I began driving faster, then taking the fork in the road to Tiverton, not Exeter, as it’s nearer. “The lanes are windy and full of potholes, so poor Amy was being bumped around. “At that moment, I turned into Lewis Hamilton. My adrenaline was rushing, but I still wasn’t freaking out.” But what came next would send even the coolest character into a flap. Amy recalled: “I had put my hands down to see what was happening, because in one of the last scans, Elsie had been lying sideways. “Now, one of my main worries, was what would happenshe did not come out head first.” She added: “I was expecting to feel hairit was her head, because we’d seen on the scans that she had a lot of hair, but I couldn’t feel any.  “Instead, she felt slimy, so I thought, ‘Oh my God, she’s come out breech!’ “I looked and saw the top of her ear, so realised she was coming out still in the amniotic sac, which didn’t burst until her elbows emerged.” Amy said: “My first words to her were, ‘You’re OK! Don’t cry!” With no idea how long the umbilical cord was, Amy just kept baby Elsie safe on her lap, tucked against her stomach, snuggled into the long, warm cardigan she was wearing. Finally arriving at the hospital, Dan left the engine running and the car doors open, as he dashed inside to find help, running along the corridors until he saw two people in medical unorms. Noting the panic on his face and in his voice, they ran back to the car with him and, as they wheeled Amy and Elsie, who weighed lb oz, onto a ward, Dan finally cracked – falling to his knees in shock.  Then, as mum and daughter were checked over and given a clean bill of health, he was able to cut the umbilical cord – one of the only things about Elsie’s delivery that went according to plan. Soon after, Hope – who loves telling people how her baby sister was born in a car – visited, before the couple spent New Year’s Eve on the empty maternity ward, watching the countdown to  and the London fireworks on TV. Now, a few months on, Dan says even talking about what happened sparks a physical reaction. He said: “I still get an adrenaline rush and can feel my heart beating just talking about it.  “A couple of months before Elsie was born, Amy had been making me watch One Born Every Minute, so in my head, babies were always born in hospital.” He added: “I was thinking we’d get to hospital, have a nice drive there and then everything would be fine. Even on the day, I thought we had plenty of time, so was quite chilled.” He had even thought to protect his car seat and footwell, in case Amy’s waters broke, by lining them with the puppy training pads they had bought for their new kitten, Zugga.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Queen is set to distance herself from the ruler of Dubai after a court ruled that he abducted and detained his daughters against their will. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ordered and orchestrated the abduction and forcedto Dubai of Sheikha Shamsa, then , in August  and her sister Sheikha Lata twice, in  and again in , according to a damning judgment published on Thursday. The confirmation of long-standing rumours surrounding Sheikh Mohammedaposs two daughters came out of his legal battle with ex-we Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein, , the half-sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan, over their two children. The Queen and Sheikh Mohammed have previously been pictured together at horse racing events and he has been invited to the Royal Box at Ascot. But The Times reported she will refuse to be photographed with him or the princess in public following the court case.  Princess Haya asked the High Court to make a series of findings of fact about Sheikh Mohammed, in particular in relation to the kidnap and forcible detention of his two adult daughters, who are from another marriage almost two decades apart. Shamsa, now , was abducted from the streets of Cambridge on August , , and has never been seen in public since.  Now Cambridgeshire Police have confirmed aspects of their  probe - which found insufficient evidence to take any action - will be revisited, although the force insisted the investigation was no longer active. A spokeswoman said: An investigation into the alleged abduction of Shamsa Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum in  was carried out by Cambridgeshire Constabulary in . With the evidence that was available to us this was insufficient to take any further action. A review took place in  and it was again concluded there was insufficient evidence to take any further action. This is no longer an active investigation and we are not in contact with the victim.  The burden of proof and evidential requirements are signicantly dferent in family court proceedings to that of criminal proceedings, however, in light of the recent release of the judgment, aspects of the case will now be subject to review. At the High Court, Princess Haya asked Sir Andrew McFarlane, the most senior family judge in England and Wales, to make findings of fact about Sheikh Mohammed in relation to his application for contact with their daughter Al Jalila, , and son Zayed, eight. Sir Andrew explained in his judgment that a substantial element in the extreme concernhas for the future well-being of her children arises from her belief that Shamsa and Lata have been and are deprived of their liberty on an open-ended basis.  In his judgment, Sir Andrew said Shamsa contacted an immigration solicitor - who cannot be named for legal reasons - in June , saying she was estranged from her father and asking for advice on how she might be able to remain in the UK. The judge stated: He heard nothing further from her until he was informed by police in August  that Shamsa may have been abducted. But, in February , the solicitor received an email said to be from Shamsa - sent by one of her sisters - which read: I was caught on August , in Cambridge. Hesent four Arab men to catch me, they were carrying guns and threatening me, they drove me to my fatheraposs place in Newmarket, there they gave me two injections and a handful of tablets, the very next morning a helicopter came and flew me to the plane, which took me back to Dubai. I am locked up until today.  The email added: I told you this would happen ... I know these people, they have all the money, they have all the power, they think they can do anything. Shamsa also provided another account of her abduction, leaving an answerphone message on the telephone of a complete stranger on August , saying she had been ed to Dubai against her will and asking for her solicitor to be informed. DCI David Beck led Cambridgeshire Policeaposs investigation into her disappearance, and discovered the arrival and departure of a helicopter which travelled from Newmarket to France at am on August . The officer sought permission from the Crown Prosecution Service to visit Dubai to interview potential witnesses, but his request was refused. At a hearing in November, Princess Hayaaposs barrister Charles Geekie QC told the court that DCI Beckaposs evidence made clear that there had been interference in the police inquiry.  In his judgment, Sir Andrew said the Foreign and Commonwealth Officehad confirmed it held information relating to the investigation of Shamsaaposs alleged kidnapping. But the FCO refused to disclose it, saying that releasing information on this issue would increase public knowledge about our relations with UAE and would reduce the UK Governmentaposs ability to protect and promote UK interests through its relations with UAE which would not be in the public interest. Sir Andrew concluded: It is not possible to find on the balance of probability that permission for Mr Beck to visit Dubai was refused because of the direct intervention of the FCO, nor, moving further still from the basic known facts, that any intervention by the FCO had been triggered by the father or the government of Dubai.  Lataaposs high-profile attempt to flee the UAE in  became public after a video account of her abduction and imprisonment at the hands of her father was published on YouTube in March of that year. But her failed bid for freedom was not the first time she tried to leave the emirate, having attempted to run away in  before being stopped at the border with Oman and ed to the family home. Lata said in her  video that she was held against her will after that escape attempt until October , during which time she was subjected to constant torture. The judge added that the cooperation of the Indian military in the operation to capture Lata demonstrated Sheikh Mohammed and the UAEaposs signicant international respect and influence. Lata was seen in public in December , when Princess Haya invited her friend Mary Robinson - former president of Ireland - to visit Dubai to establish proof of le.

Although their aim is to throw the companyaposs huge financial weight behind developing a vaccine, aposProject Gesundheitapos, as it is known, is also looking into new ways of treating the illness. A landmark study published by the University of Michigan found that colds cost the US economy about  billion annually. This is due to the costs associated with visits to the doctor and lost productivity. The same  study also found that colds account for nearly  million missed school days. However, finding a cure is dficult for a number of reasons. There are  dferent strains of rhinovirus - a type of virus which accounts for about  per cent of colds - which makes it hard to find an effective treatment which would cover them all. Rhinoviruses are also highly prone to mutation. This means that evena treatment were effective to begin with, its shelf le could be limited by the virus developing resistance. And finally, it is believed that evena drug that works were found, unless it has zero side effects, it wonapost be profitable. Experts say that as most people will recover fully from a cold within a week or two, they are unlikely to use a drug which comes with side effects which could potentially be more unpleasant. aposProject Gesundheitapos is believed to sit under Amazonaposs elusive research and development group known as Grand Challenge.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Person-wearing-Medical-Face-Mask-to-protect-against-Coronavirus-Covid-19_34708990-907x564.jpg ","title":"dundees most vulnerable residents worried by coronavirus spread","story":"The most vulnerable of Dundee#s population have been left worried by infection as coronavirus spreads across the country.Members of the city#s homeless community have expressed concerns that they may be unable to keep clean or self-isolate following the confirmation of three cases of the virus in Scotland.The disease, which has infected more than , people and claimed more than , lives, struck Scotland on Sunday after a case was confirmed in Tayside.Clayre Stewart, a homeless woman who sleeps rough in Dundee, is worried that the virus will be able to spread to her easily.She said: #It didn#t worry me until I saw people out wearing masks yesterday afternoon.#People like me have got nowhere that we can feel safe. I don#t have an environment to go to where I know it#s clean.#Nobody seems to be thinking about us beggars.

He was ill at Queen of the South and, maybe stupidly, I played him when he wasn’t right.“But he’s now almost recovered and we’ll have him back for Saturday.”Dundee may have drawn a blank against the Wasps, but McPake was as delighted with his side’s performance as he was annoyed by the result.The Dark Blues fired  shots at the Alloa goal to no avail.Yet McPake took heart from the creative nature of his side’s showing ahead of a potentially pivotal double-header with play-off rivals Ayr.“We’ll take the positives for Saturday, we’re going down to Ayr then they’re coming here,” said McPake. vw, px\"  “It’s two massive games for our football club and,we perform like that, then we’ll give ourselves a right good chance.“At the minute, it’s sore but, though it was only one point, it’s another clean sheet. That’s one positive.“Another is, you could pick probably four or five games from earlier in the season and add our chances up – and we created more chances last night.“And the fans – for me that’s a positive because people keep saying they get on the players’ backs.“That’s rightly so because we haven’t been creating chances and giving them something to cheer, but you certainly heard them last night.“They were egging us on and really pushing.“I turned round during the game and said, ‘The atmosphere’s back’, and we need that.“It’s not a cry for help, but we need to keep producing performances like that to keep the atmosphere up, to keep the fans onside.“To keep them helping us we need performances like last night – with the goals added.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e62125da4da53.74996896.jpg ","title":"massive ayr clashes wont overawe christie elliott","story":"Christie Elliott hasn’t lost in a Dundee shirt.Andthe Dark Blues keep playing the way they have been, he doesn’t see why that should change.Former Partick Thistle man Elliott’s arrival at Dens has coincided with a four-game unbeaten run.The timing could hardly be better ahead of back-to-back clashes with play-off rivals Ayr United.For Elliott, it has been a dream start.But there has been one shock to deal with – the fact that the Dee haven’t already secured a top-four place.“Four games without losing is a good way to start with a new club – especially one as massive as Dundee,” said Elliott.“From this point, it’s all about consistency. We’ve not been beaten in the last few games but it’s important to turn the draws into wins.“We created a number of chances against Alloa on Tuesday night. We just need to put those away going forward.“Alloa was a crazy game. When you look back at how many chances we created – good chances too. In a normal game they go in and it’s -.“It’s one of those things. We’ve taken a lot of positives from it and we’ll take them into the Ayr game.“I’m surprised, from the way I’ve seen us play, that we’re not further up the league.“The squad is a really good one. I thought: ‘It’s going to be really hard to get in the team in the first place,’ but, luckily enough, I was there within a game.“It’s important as a team that we stick together now and try to get as many points on the board as we can between now and the end of the season.”The consistency of James McPake’s recent team selections has translated into improved – and further improving – performances.The -- system employed by the Dee boss since the - draw away to Greenock Morton in early February seems to suit his players.For Elliott, that tactical comfort is a huge positive.“Everyone on the pitch knows their role,” he said.“Defensively, everybody knows what they need to be doing. We defend as a team. But we’ve also created a number of chances in each and every game I’ve played.“It’s important now that we keep going and keep building on the positives we’re taking from each game.“If you get a few wins together you never know how far you can push your way up.”A pair of wins in the next four days against Ayr would be a big ask but it would do the Dee cause the world of good.They would probably settle for four points.But you won’t catch anyone at Dens admitting it.“These games are massive,” said Elliott.“You look at other teams within the league, below you, and they still have an opportunity to finish in the play-offs, so it’s vital we keep picking up wins. But there’s confidence in the dressing-room. In all the games I’ve played, we’ve created loads of chances.“It’s important we keep doing that, keep doing the other things we’re good at, and get three points on the board whenever we can.”Come the end of the campaign, Dundee will have the option to extend Elliott’s stay at Dens.Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, that’s something the -year-old hopes they take up.“I just want to play games and do well for the club. If they like me, the ball’s in their court,” he said.“But as I said, I’ve enjoyed my time since I’ve been here. Everyone in and around the club is great and I would love to stay herethe club want me.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee finding form as united stutter on title march","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, Sean Hamilton and Graeme Finnan dissect Dundee’s recent upturn in fortunes, discuss what United need to do to get their title march back on course and Billy Gilmour – is he good enough to be capped Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e621255e805a3.39290847-scaled.jpg ","title":"reynolds fresh united need not worry about ict in title approach","story":"Captain Mark Reynolds believes a re-invigorated Dundee United side should have no concerns about Inverness as they aim to sew up the Championship title.Reynolds insists United are not worrying about an ICT side who have closed the gap at the top to  points and have two games in hand as they enter the final round of fixtures against Partick Thistle at Tannadice tomorrow.What was otherwise a good point as the Terrors played out a goalless draw at Ayr United on Tuesday night was soured slightly by the Caley Jags’ late - win over Morton.However, defender Reynolds feels, with no more midweek games between now and the end of the season, the Tangerines have an advantage over their opponents with more hectic schedules.Askedhe was disappointed to discover Inverness had won, the -year-old said: “Not really. It is what it is with them, they’re going to pick up results.“We’re not at the stage where we’re worrying about Inverness yet.

It’s a cup final when teams play us. Inverness felt that when they played us the other week and it was the same for Ayr.“It’ll be a tough run-in with people taking points off each other but we just need to keep plugging away and re-focus.“Luckily, our schedule goes from weekend to weekend from now on so we can hit every game fresh, with teams coming in with strained squads playing Saturday-Tuesday.”Reynolds admits United are eager to get back on home soil after some tough games on the road.“Tannadice has been a good place for us and we’re looking forward to getting back on a nice pitch.“The pitch down at Ayr held up well considering the amount of rain we’ve had but it’s nice to get back home.“We need to keep going and pushing to make sure we get three points. I think there’s pressure on every game, home and away, when you play for Dundee United.“We’re coming into every game as the league leaders and it’s been like that all season, but we’ve managed to handle it so far.“We go into every game confident we can win but we know that’s not going to happen.

We need to finish the season strongly.”In six games at Pittodrie this season, four in the league and two in the Scottish Cup, the Dons have won just once.McLennan cannot pinpoint what is going wrong on home turf but he and his fellow Dons are desperate to put it right.On the home form this year, he said: “I don’t know why that is. “All we can do now is try to focus on the rest of the games coming up and hopefully put that right.”McLennan was pivotal in the Reds battling back from behind at Rugby Park with an assist for Niall McGinn’s opener before pitching in with his third goal of the season with a header.He said: “The goal was what we needed to get the point although obviously we wanted the three.“It is always good to get on the scoresheet but the main thing was that we didn’t get the win at Kilmarnock that we wanted.“Niall is finding a knack in that central area and is getting a few goals in there.“I seem to be able to pick him out and Niall reads the balls I deliver into the box. We are getting a good connection.”The draw at Kilmarnock was only McLennan’s eighth start of the campaign to date.Last season the winger started  times and was a vital cog in Derek McInnes’ starting XI in the second half of the term, in the absence of Gary Mackay-Steven due to injury.Mackay-Steven would move to New York City last summer.After delivering a goal and assist Pittodrie youth academy graduate McLennan aims to make a major impact in the bid for Europe and Scottish Cup glory.He said: “The season has been a bit stop start for me and I did not have a run of games as much as I would have wanted to.“There are plenty of players in the squad and ones coming back from injury so we are getting stronger as a squad. It is good to have that competition. In training the standard is always up there.“Hopefully now I can start the season as strong as I can.”When not selected for the starting XI McLennan bust a gut to force his way into the side.He said: “You have to do what you can to get in the team and then to stay in it. There was a lot of games recently in February so the team was getting rotated quite a lot.“You do what you can on the training pitch and the gaffer will choose who he thinks can help win the game.”Currently sitting third in the Premiership, Motherwell occupy pole position for Europe, with a three-point advantage over Aberdeen.The home clash with Hibs today is the first of a double header this week that will be crucial in the race for third.Aberdeen face Motherwell away on Friday in a game thatnot “must win”, is a “must not lose#.McLennan said: “It is always a tough game against Hibs.“Obviously Hibs did not get a good result against Heartsso we know they will be right up for it.“We will have to be ready for them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

We also take a look at what farming is doing to tackle climate change – the issue of the decade.#We were delighted to work alongside NFUS to produce these episodes of OnFARM. Podcasting is a superb way to get key messages across in a way that is enjoyable to listen to and yet informative at the same time.

The glass came well back. At a quarter to eight we heard a poor weather forecast with gales and rain for practically every area including north-easters for both Malin and Hebrides. In the news that followed we heard that Moyanawas in trouble on her way home and was asking for help as she would have to be abandoned.As there was no hurry about moving as we meant to wait for the flood and there was obviously little enjoyment to be had on deck we turned over and went to sleep again. We hoped to make Tobermory in the late afternoon having the flood with us all the way andthings got no worse.At half past nine we began to turn out. A cold strong north-westerly was blowing but it was dry. Seewolf had sailed for Oban but Lindisfarne was still with us with Guy still shoutingand singing with undiminished enthusiasm. The Saguenay was not happy – a man was crouching in her cockpit with the lead line in his hand keeping watch for the first sign of dragging.We had a breakfast of grapefruitand bacon and eggs. One of the eggs when broken into a cup was so rotten it nearly blew the Pilot out of the forecastle.After our meal we had a big clean up above and below and the Tar pumped the ship then, with the wind falling light, the rain started again and blankets etc. up on deck to air had to come down in a hurry, but the glass was beginning to show signs of being somewhere near the bottom for the time being.The Tanky and Tar took shelter in the dog-house with the Major and talked of this and that while the rest of us occupied ourselves below. The Bosun and Pilot finished putting the tacklines in the flags, the former got a book while the latter started sketching. The Skipper had a patent lighter that could be used in any weather no matter how blowy or how wet, but which, when working emitted a series of sparks and this was the subject of one of the sketches. The Mate fitted up a tumbler holder in the ladies cabin then did some knitting, the Skipper, after cutting the tacklines to the requiredhad a snooze.At two o’clock by which time it was calm and raining less heavily, the Tanky and Mate started getting our dinner of lamb salad, greengages and custard, coffee and Yo-Yo biscuits, ready and the Pilot and Skipper tried mixing gin and Dubonnet but decided that to do so merely spoilt good gin. The Tanky, however, seemed to enjoy Dubonnet by itself and she was given the freedom of the bottle. About this time the man in the Saguenay got tired of holding his lead line and he shted billet to inshore from us.When we started lunch it was almost a flat calm, but coming on deck after it ready to go onto Tobermory, we found the wind had risen considerably and had veered a point. We got our anchor at four o’clock and under engine went out into the Sound of Mull and, turning west, began to get up our sails as we passed the Morven Pier.In view of the forecast and of what we could see ahead of us we decided to tie down two reefs. We got the tack and clew lashed down and had started on the reef points when we began to doubt the wisdom of proceeding. The wind was fresh and getting stronger every minute and the sea was increasing similarly – to go on would mean getting a proper hammering and the prospect of a north-east gale would mean our intended anchorage in Tobermory would probably be most uncomfortable .The decision of whether to turn back or not was left to the Skipper for as usual, on these occasions, the Pilot steadfastly refused to offer any opinion, but he did agree that the Skipper was right when he decided on the former course. Round we came, the jib was broken out, and we scampered back to Loch Aline. At the narrows the jib was furled and under engine only we ran up to Kinlochaline and let go off the boat-house at ten past five. The Mate, Tanky, and Tar, down below and unaware of our change of plan were quite bewildered when they heard the chain run out and the first named came on deck to find out where we had got to.The Saguenay had preceded us to this anchorage and the Lindisfarne came up a little later and Guy said that Kyle Bay, in the rapidly rising gale, was getting almost untenable. In Kinlochaline we were very comfortable though, even here there was quite a lop on the water and we were sheering about a good deal in the squalls. It was raining very heavily but the Bosun took the Major ashore, but still without any concrete results.At six we had a cup of tea with cake and biscuits and by the time this was finished it was blowing a full gale. The weather forecast was bad and our only consolation was that it was ever so much worse for the South.In the Channel the barometer had reached a record low level for July and force  and  winds were commonly reported all over England and Wales. With us the glass had turned and was . up since mid-day. Then with the exceptions of the Bosun who was in the dog-house and the Tar who played patience we spent the next hour or so dosing in the cabin.At half past eight we had a supper of scrambled eggs and meat roll for those that wanted it, then we put up the tents and down the angel and veered a further five fathoms of chain, making it twenty out in three fathoms of water.We could see out in the Sound of Mull that a huge sea was running and down by the narrows the top of the water was being swept off in spindrt. The squalls where we were were very fierce but, there being no sea, we were lying quite comfortably and never once put a pull on the anchor though we did suffer rather badly from bobstayitis.Two motor boats came up for shelter. One, Ormidale, anchored off the west shore opposite us, but the otherlet go out in the middle of the loch and kept steaming to her anchor for as long as we could see her.It was a wild night and at eleven o’clock to cheer himself up the Bosun made coffee for himself and the Pilot and half a cupful for the Tanky. While they were having it the rest of us started to turn in.That gale was news and in our sheltered corner we had no idea how bad it was. Even in Crinan warps were carried away and yachts set adrt in the basin. All round the coast were reports of vessels in distress one, a steamer in the Channel, being rolled right over.Next week:"},{"url":null,"title":"pedal power at macpool","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt was with trepidation I arrived at Mid Argyll Community Poolahead of the aqua bike try-out session [writes Rachel Carruthers].Exercise classes and I don#t often seem like a natural fit but I was excited to give the new craze a go.Aqua cycling uses stationary bikes immersed in a swimming pool, with water up to participants# waists, making it a non-weight bearing exercise.Aqua bikes can be used at all abilities and are often used in high intensity classes, giving a vigorous cardiovascular workout in a low impact environment # an ideal way to reduce obesity and prevent ill health.Stationary cycling and water-based exercises are also frequently recommended for patients suffering with osteoarthritis or recovering from knee and hip surgery or injury, therefore combining both is an obvious step.MACPool successfully applied for funding through the Argyll and Bute HSCP Self Management Fund to run the All Ability Cycling Project in partnership with Cycling UK and the Ardrishaig Bothy. As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

American.And although some may only know the titular song, Anything Goes, audiences are bound to fall in love with the equally tuneful I Get a Kick Out of You and Blow, Gabriel, Blow.If the classic showtunes werent enough to whet your theatre appetite, the amazing cast of this production will certainly capture your attention.Donning the flapper style, each cast member brings their own flair to their roles.Anything Goes star-crossed lovers, Hope Harcourt and Billy Crocker, played by Catriona Lamb and Jack McAuley show that even when apart, their characters determination to be together couldnt be stopped by those who would stand in their way. Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC. Kick-off is pm with Kintyre Park the expected venue.

Edinburgh University, astonishingly, failed to support her.The gay tennis icon Martina Navratilova was expelled from the LGBT group, Athlete Ally, for saying that people with male physiques should not complete in womenrsquos sport.Cultural and health bodies, and even the Scottish Government, were ceasing to use the very word ldquowoman in case it offended male-bodied transwomen. Bizarre substitutes like ldquowomxn, ldquomenstruators and ldquociswomen were being deployed in the cause of inclusivity.Well, times change. This issue is now out in the open. More and more women are speaking out against the undermining of sex-based rights.Even the ultra-wokeis permitting columns from feminists like Suzanne Moore calling for an end to the ldquono ing of gender-critical academics like Professor Selina Todd and Dr Kathleen Stock. They have been labelled as ldquoTerfs by trans zealots.Last week, the UK Government called a halt to self-identication legislation south of the Border. Ministers discovered that children as young as  are being given puberty blockers by gender reassignment clinics. Puberty blockers halt the sexual development of children. They are of the class of drugs once used as chemical castration for sex offenders.Influential figures in the SNP, like the former communications guru, Kevin Pringle, are now urging Nicola Sturgeon to follow the UK Government. But the Scottish Equalities Secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, apparently intends to press ahead with legislation to allow self-ID. Mr Pringle is speaking for many in the party who now realise that the growing backlash against Self-ID could threaten the SNPrsquos chances in next yearrsquos Holyrood elections.Yet it seemed glaringly obvious to me two years ago that women would never accept this existential assault on their sexual identity. How could they be expected to accept people with male genitalia and masculine physiques as real women  Why should women be forced to accept male-bodied transwomen in their protected spaces, in changing rooms and toilets Indeed, at first I thought this proposition that transwomen were literally women was just anti-trans scaremongering. Surely activists werenrsquot actually saying that they were biologically female I learned the hard way that this is precisely what they were saying. I was repeatedly accused of hate speech for suggesting that this would mean the removal of human biology from the school curriculum.Political leaders like Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens and the former leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson continue to insist that people with penises can be and are actually female. Labourrsquos Shadow Equalities Secretary, Dawn Butler, said last month that ldquobabies are born without a sex. This is pure flat earthism.Shamefully, leading feminists like Germaine Greer have been ldquocancelled for objecting to extreme transgenderism as misogyny. That it demeans and invalidates women.How could someone with a male body possibly experience social reality in the way real women do  Transwomen do not have uteruses, do not menstruate, do not give birth.Trans advocates reply that, well, some women canrsquot give birth and some women donrsquot menstruate. This is ridiculous and offensive sophistry. Asa woman ceases to be a womanshe canrsquot have children.These canards are still re on social media with people arguing that clown fish changing sex, and people born intersex ldquoprovethat there is no fixed biological definition of sex.Humans are of course mammals, not fish. The existence of a minuscule number of people born intersexdoesnrsquot alter the fact that . per cent of humans are born male or female.Humans are a binary species. We are not hermaphrodites. Sexual dferentiation is the basis of human reproduction. That this needs to be said is a shocking reflection on the intellectual integrity of the left. Many supposedly sensible people have been morally coerced into accepting something they know to be untrue. It is deeply worrying.Most SNP politicians know that transgender ideology is nonsense. They keep quiet partly because of fear of Britainrsquos onerous hate speech laws.It has been left to genuinely courageous women like Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry, MP, to fight for reason. For doing so they have been the target of astonishing abuse on social media, and from the trans activists embedded in the SNP.Academics like Lucy Hunter Blackburn have bravely challenged the proposal to remove the question on sex from the national census.This has nothing to do with ldquotransgender rights. Trans people are free to identy as anyone they wish. No one is stopping them wearing what they want or loving who they wish. This is not homophobia ..In fact, advocates of Self-ID, like Stonewall, have set back the cause of trans rights by harnessing it to a quasi-religious dogma.Mr Pringle and others in the SNP now realise that the Scottish Government is marching into a minefield by persevering with Self-ID without proper debate. Given the pause in England, it could lead to a transgender Gretna Green.But there is an equitable solution. Of course allow transwomen to identy as female without needless bureaucratic obstacles. But the Government should make clear in the legislation reforming the Gender Recognition Act that this does not mean abolishing the biological definition of sex or infringing womenrsquos sex-based rights under the Equalities Act.Yoursquod think that a feminist like Nicola Sturgeon would regard that as self-evident. Perhaps she does.

The rest, as they say, is history. Except, in the case of the Tudor dynasty, this is a period thatrsquos never allowed to die. And in Henryrsquos case, as everyone knows, Anne Boleyn was only the second bite on his kebab.The publication of the final part of Hilary Mantelrsquos Thomas Cromwell trilogy, The Mirror  the Light, has been treated asitrsquos breaking news. The antics of the rapacious Henry VIII and his Machiavellian chief minister took place nearly  years ago, yet the airwaves, review and feature pages, and even fashion spreads are dominated by talk of the Tudors. Whether itrsquos their backstabbing ambition, headbands and bodices, or iron-fisted bureaucracy, weto them again and again, like birds to a hollow coconut shell, hoping for another flake.Mantelrsquos work is as thorough and intense an exploration of the political mind as yoursquoll find. That the previous two books in the series won the Booker Prize indicates their artistic merit as well as their accuracy. Those who donrsquot feel Cromwell merits so many pages might be surprised to find themselves hooked. And, although the factual detail is so well-founded the trilogy could become set texts for students, this is the past recast by the authorrsquos imagination. Official, dispassionate, unspun history it is not.Mantelrsquos portrayal of Henryrsquos sleekit, ruthless, tight-lipped consigliere has parallels with people in power today. Those echoes, and the entanglements of a murderous but exquisitely dressed court, are where the perennial fascination with Henryrsquos entourage lies. That his time on the throne was soon to be followed by Elizabeth Irsquos long tenure has ensured that,this era is to your taste, therersquos enough to chew on for a letime. Yet dramatic and richly brocaded as all this is, havenrsquot we now had enough  Isnrsquot it time to look where, and bid the Tudors farewell Historical fiction sounds like a timeless niche, untroubled by tides of fashion. As Mantelrsquos supremacy shows, however, it is as susceptible to fads as everything . There was a time when the Tudors were considered dusty and tired. Mention of Henryrsquos six wives or the Spanish Armada conjured up Jean Plaidy and school lessons: interestingthat was your kind of thing, but hardly thrilling or new.Writers in this genre are in a tricky situation. Publishers want them to be original yet follow the road more travelled, to mine a popular seam but make it their own. If nothing , Mantelrsquos oeuvre is a masterclass in how to go about this. Yet some years ago, before her meteoric rise, it seemed the appetite for Tudor was waning. The German market, a literary agent told me, had overdosed and lost interest in buying the rights to anything further from this era. Then Mantel rekindled the flame to such an extent that today, from Hamburg to Heidelberg, she will be in bookshop windows, kept company on the shelves by best-selling Alison Weir and Philippa Gregory, both of whom have also made Hampton Court their second home.And, just as the pitiless English royals in farthingales and ruffs are enjoying their moment in the sun, so too is anything set during the two world wars, or in Victoriarsquos later years. Like children who ask for the same story every bedtime, it seems that readers love nothing better than retreading old ground before they douse the lights.Most genre novels are looked down on by the literati as second class citizens. That is why Mantelrsquos Booker victories offered such encouragement for others ploughing a similar furrow. Yet having written historical fiction myself, set in the early th-century Borders, I have reservations: not about the calibre or worth of the genre, but about how it ranks with fiction that comes almost entirely from the writerrsquos imagination.As Andrew Marr said of The Mirror  the Light, the ending is never in doubt. The same goes for aspects of all books in which real-le figures play a part. When it comes to plotting, these fixed points become the beads on the rosary between which the narrative is threaded. They might cause problems when interweaving made-up with documented events, but they provide an off-the-peg outline around which to build a story. Writers portraying modern le through invented characters do not have this luxury. All they can rely upon are their powers of invention and the quality of their prose. To my mind, despite the spadework needed when researching previous centuries, that is a much harder act to pull off.With the Tudors dominating the bestseller lists, what astonishes me most is how little of our history fiction has yet covered. In this country alone there is material for libraries of new novels set in the centuries before the Stewarts claimed the throne, and long after the Jacobites retreated to their peaty hovels. The past might well be a foreign country, as L P Hartley wrote, but some areas seem to attract package holiday tours, leaving tumbleweed to roll through the rest."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-pandemic-clear-bed-blocking-people-taken-system","story":"Professor June Andrews recognised hercomments were ldquohorric but gave an honest assessmentof the potential consequences of a large-scale coronavirus outbreak.Prof Andrews is a former director of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Centre for Change and Innovation.

Struan Stevensonreveals an equally profound misunderstanding of my own country. Amongst his many wilful misinterpretations, his reference to ldquohellipattempts to break up Canadarsquos -year-old unionhellip is particularly revealing. The UK is a union Canada is a Confederation. Canadians routinely refer to their ldquofederal government. The federal nature of its governance is what has kept this geographically, linguistically and culturally erse country together.The two referendums on Quebec independence reinforced this federalism and changed the whole country. And even that may not be enough to save the confederation, whose fate still hangs in the balance. By contrast, there is not, and never has been, anything remotely federal about UK governance. The UK is the most centralised of all the democracies. It is as far from any kind of Canadian federalism as is possible. The idea that it would ever embrace such federalism is disingenuous nonsense.

of Partick Curling Club, said: \"The stones have been with the club for more than a hundred years, and we feel the time is right for some new curlers to get some enjoyment from them.\"They are all outdoor stones so with all these changing weather patterns it may be a while before the new owners can get the opportunity to use them.Curling is said to date back to the th century, and was first played on frozen ponds and lochs in Scotland using flat stones taken from riverbeds.Known as the roaring game for the noise the stones make as they travel across the ice, the oldest stone dates from

taken curling around the world as they emigrated, most notably to Canada and New Zealand, where curling still remains popular.It has also been picked up by Scandinavian countries, who regularly send

According to UK law, voyeurism is the illegal viewing or recording of another person while they conduct private activities. Did such an edict concern our George  Not much, it didnrsquot. In his song When Irsquom Cleaning Windows, which he first belted out in one of his popular movies, Formby boasted about the amount of sneaky peeking he enjoyed while he was meant to be innocently plying his trade.On the tunersquos release, the BBC was as disgusted as any newspaper columnist spotting a bottle of tonic wine in the hand of a West Lothian crooner. The head of the corporation at the time, Lord Reith, sputtered: ldquoIf the public wants to listen to Formby singing his disgusting little ditty, theyll have to be content to hear it in the cinemas, not over the nations airwaves. As he was born and raised in Glasgow, Lord Reith surely must have been an expert on disgusting little ditties, so should have been obeyed by the great unwashed. But the public chose to ignore him instead, and Formbyrsquos song become one of the biggest hits of the s.Which proves that the public loves a bad boy. Eventhe bad boy plays a ukulele.

You guessed it, Irsquom spending the day spying on Lewis Capaldi. Okay...not quite. Though only because Irsquom assuming Lewis has a bunch of snappy, scrappy dogs roaming his grounds, protecting him and his privacy. And those snappy, scrappy dogs are probably tanked up on the Bucky, just like their sweetly-crooning master.Since an invasion of Capaldirsquos privacy isnrsquot on the cards, I instead find myself, late of an evening, in Glasgowrsquos south side.

Therersquos a large crowd of us ndash men, women, children ndash all ogling the neighbourhood windows. We occasionally clap and cheer, too,we spot something we all agree is particularly entertaining or memorable. Meanwhile, the people in the houses play up to our prying. Some of them sing and dance others just cavort without musical accompaniment.The reason for all this vibrant voyeurism  Irsquom at Strathbungo Window Wanderland, a curious event, now in its fourth year, where locals decorate their windows in a lavish and sometimes surreal fashion.Why  For the entertainment of anyone who happens to be sauntering past, of course. Though most of the people on the streets tonight arenrsquot random rubberneckers. Like myself they arrived quite deliberately. Wersquore all loitering with intent here to experience a very unusual evening.Advent calendarSome of the windows I stroll past are decorated with simple designs. One homeowner has painted a barcode across glass. There are also pop culture references galore. I spot the silhouette of Yoda from Star Wars, and a Harry Potter themed house.A few images are political, and therefore tedious. A window is a transparent sheet of glass, after all, that allows light to shine through. Such glass should never be dulled by the dreary smear of dogma.The houses are backlit by interior lighting, making theof each street look like a glowing advent calendar. Perhaps the most impressive display is a two-storey house kitted out like a giant jukebox. And itrsquos a loud jukebox, at that. On the second floor of the house a live band are playing. They face the window, their music flowing onto the street.During my window walkabout I bump into Brian Morgan, who lives nearby and is manning a stall selling decorative art made out of fragments of old Strathbungo windows. ldquoWe reclaimed them, he explains, ldquoand turned them into shapes that are based on a map of Strathbungo.The glass shapes are crafted to look decidedly quirky.

But what most people do have in common is a sense of community. Strathbungo has a self-contained vibe.

I decide to step outside the Strathbungo lsquovillagersquo and find myself back in the city of Glasgow, where I spot a pub packed with punters. None of the tipsy tipplers look particularly disappointed to be missing out on the Window Wanderland taking place only a few metres away.

Thus, human empathy flees and is replaced by something dismal: the urge to view other people as competitors who must be eliminated in the struggle for survival. This is what happens when civilisations collapse in on themselves.Last week it was reported that Roberto Giuliani, the director of Romersquos Santa Cecilia Conservatory, one of the worldrsquos oldest music institutes, told students from China, Japan and South Korea they were forbidden to attend classes until they were certiably free of the virus.

Okay pals  Ms Gillan hails from Glasgowrsquos east end.In the way we are inclined to react when a pathogen is on the loose there are parallels to be found in our attitudes towards those whom we perceive as a threat to our way of le. Immigrant communities and those fleeing terror from brutal regimes are already accustomed to being regarded as virulent. We round them up isolate and detain them and then pack them off to their country of origin using some minor refraction real or imagined.Those we give leave to remain must first be doused in the healing waters of a UK history exam which conveniently omits to mention any of those gnarly deeds of empire which caused them ultimately to seek peace here. We havenrsquot yet got round to forcing them to wear bells around their necks and shout ldquoUnclean! Unclean! but the Toriesrsquo Windrush project was a close approximation.We ascribe to them, in the manner of a pandemic, all sorts of anti-social behaviours and deploy our Conservative-leaning newspapers to de-humanise them and portray them as a danger to the British way of le. Only after we consider them safe and have absorbed them safely into the UK bloodstream do we permit a limited number ndash at a distance ndash to share in this nationrsquos bounty, much of which is built on what we looted from their countries in the first place.The instinct towards the survival of the fittest, which lies at the heart of Tory doctrine, comes to the fore when a global pandemic begins to rattle. In , the prestigious US think-tank Brookings studied how poor countries and disadvantaged communities suffer disproportionately when pandemics roar. ldquoRegardless of where a pandemic starts, once underway, the poor tend to bear the brunt. Low and middle-income countries have weaker health systems and limited capacity to handle surges in cases.The essay went on: ldquoWe can curtail pandemicswe quickly develop vaccines and make them widely accessible. However, without vigorous efforts to secure equitable access, vaccine distribution will follow the logic of the market. During the  swine flu pandemic, wealthy countries secured large advance orders for vaccines, but, despite the efforts of the World Health Organisation to negotiate donations, poor countries were crowded out ndash receiving vaccines more slowly than rich countries and unable to cover as many of their citizens.At its most primitive level this tendency is evident in bulk-buying at supermarkets or filling up at petrol stations during an energy shortage. Those with economic muscle use it to hoard rather than to share those without must endure as best they can. Itrsquos a distillation of all Conservative philosophy. Global capitalism works by identying or creating shortages and then exploiting them and keeping them out of the reach of the majority.No mercy can ever be found here and anything that speaks of weakness infirmity or poverty is deemed to be self-inflicted.

Already, though, we are witnessing its corrosive effects on the human spirit which are much more wretched than the physical toll.

Therefore, the decision to go with one team was made.“As I’m sure we can all understand, Shetland, who have supported us throughout, were unhappy with this decision and asked Orkney to reconsider and look at other ways to try to field a second team.“For Orkney, the cost of travel and the amount the association would have to subsidise players’ travel made sending two teams unfeasible.“Shetland voiced their concern over the cost of organising the event for only one team, and, after further discussions, the decision was finally taken that this year’s senior inter-county would not take place.“This decision has not been taken lightly, and the committee and players involved are very disappointed.“We hope the fixtures willnext year.”Shetland are in the midst of an unrelenting winning run at senior inter-county level Orkney having last won the ‘A’ fixture in .Leask said: “We tried to re-arrange it. Both counties have tried to do as much as we can.”The  inter-county will be the th anniversary of the fixtures, and both counties will be eager to ensure the occasion is celebrated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to this report, in fact, Huawei is one of the companies that has benefitted.”Responding during the debate, Iain Duncan Smith MP said: “I think that’s shocking. I thinkthat is true it is an absolutely indictment and I do think the British Government has got to be speaking up more. It is shocking and it is time that we call it for what it is.”Summing up at the end of the debate, the minister for digital infrastructure, Matt Warman MP, said: #The UK has been vocal in drawing attention to the systematic violation of human rights of Uighur Muslims. We set out our expectations in the UK National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights.”Speaking after the debate, Mr Carmichael added: “The reports surrounding Huawei and the use of forced labour are concerning. Local people want better connectivity in the Northern Isles and where, but they don#t want it built on the back of slave labour.

They asserted that it went against current council policy, which dictates that there should be no permanent increases to the current officer establishment.At the end of discussions, the council leader received more support, and councillor Stockan’s motion won,  votes to seven.However, at a general meeting of the council yesterday, Tuesday, the council leader agreed that the issue should be referred back to the policy and resources committee, following a further call by Councillor Tullock.Councillor Tullock said that he made his amendment in light of the failure of Scottish Government to provide a budget settlement to OIC, plus the concerns expressed to him by his constituents on the issue.Councillor Stockan said that he himself had received support for the establishment of the post, but he was happy to have it taken back to committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Following discussions with the OIC Economic Development department, we decided to hold the seminar and networking event just after the Business Festival to give an informative seminar for local businesses who are interested in the global market.“Mr Yukita will talk about Japan and UK relations, the Japanese economy, structural reform, business opportunities and tips for doing business with Japan.“We also invited local businessmen Stephen Kemp, who recently went to Japan to explore the Japanese market, and Gareth Davies, from Aquatera, to be guest speakers and ists. They will present information on the potential and the reality of conducting business globally.”Harvey Johnston, who is a patron of the OJA largely due to family connections with the country, will chair the event while Liam McArthur will be attending the seminar as Chairman of OJA.

It will require UK classication and certication and the complex process involved in this is well under way.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation is now missed very much. It was an independent local organisation for the people of Orkney.#Ms Taylor, along with former colleagues and supporters, feels that there is now a big void in community mental health services. They are interested in hearing thoughts, views and ideas regarding a proposed new venture called Orkney Open Door Counselling, with the eventual aim being to source funding and sponsorship for the running of a service and its premises.The closure of OACAS, which was announced shortly before Christmas, has caused a great deal of upset in the community, with several clients and former staff members sharing their concerns with The Orcadian. The service#s former chairwoman, Chloe Jowett, has said that #years of underfunding# and a history of #undervaluing# community mental health services in Orkney was behind its abrupt and unwelcome demise.All are welcome at the public meeting, due to be held at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, on Saturday, March  at pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It suggests that agreement is possible on how the newer vessels that our internal ferry services so desperately need might be funded.“Fuel and maintenance costs continue to rise steeply, while the disruption caused by the removal of MV Eynhallow from service illustrates perfectly the urgency of putting in place vessels that are fit for purpose.“The Transport Minister has acknowledged again that Orkney’s internal ferry services fall well below the minimum standards set out in the government’s own National Ferries Plan. He also insists that discussions with the Council to find a long term solution to the delivery of these leline services are ‘ongoing’.“Meantime, however, the communities in Orkney most directly affected are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of visible progress. No doubt they will be hoping that the resolution regarding the Golden Mariana’s replacement now paves the way for agreement between the council and ministers on a wider programme of vessel replacement.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But there’s also something for adults, with the Freaky Sequin Cabaret and the madness of the Old Time Sailors raucous flashmob concerts.Keeping to the sea theme, there will be two talks telling tales of the high seas — one on a canoeing trip around the UK and the other a near-death experience on the Round the World yacht race.“This year we’re trying to take events out across the islands and to introduce audiences to experiences in new venues,” said Alasdair.“So we’ll see a horn quartet in the kitchen of Noltland Castle on Westray and talks about le on the high seas in Highland Park Distillery.”The festival ends with a silent film, accompanied by a live performance of newly created music.Orkney’s midsummer St Magnus International Festival marks the start of the summer’s festivals in Scotland and each year brings large numbers to the islands, boosting the economy and revealing Orkney to the wider world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow. The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 27 ","story":"With the Six Nations Rugby Championship now three-fths of the way through, only France remain unbeaten.Scotland’s victory over Italy in Rome on Saturday was deserved, and enough to avoid the ignominy of the wooden spoon.As a spectacle the match will not live long in the memory, save for captain Stuart Hogg scoring the kind of try that only a few in the world can produce.Hogg’s display overall was very good, both defensively and from an attacking point of view. From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent.

A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March .

This will obviously be kept under constant review.As has previously been stated, there will not be a sharp transition between containment and delay phases. Many of the actions taken during containment will still continue in any delay phase. Responses may y between dferent regions, depending on the circumstances.It comes as five new cases were identied last night in the Republic of Ireland bringing to  the number of confirmed cases in the country.The National Public Health Emergency Team announced the new cases.Among them is a female healthcare worker in the south of Ireland and her case is associated with a close contact with a confirmed case, the National Public Health Emergency Team announced.

The Department of Health and the HSE are equally dedicated to protecting and supporting this vital group of people.Dr Ronan Glynn, Ireland#s deputy chief medical officer, said: The past number of weeks have been challenging for everyone in our healthcare system.

A timely reminder to keep a level head in the face of rising panic, the slogan has been circulating on social media for the last week or so, as the numbers of infections and deaths from Coronavirus continue, apparently inexorably, to climb and even the most phlegmatic amongst us struggle not to get carried away in a growing atmosphere of alarm.We are all, it#s fair to say, pretty concerned. But what about those of us who are already predisposed to excessive worry  Almost one in five people, for example, has an anxiety disorder. For those with mental health problems, hours of any ordinary day can be spent firefighting panic and dread. So how does a catastrophist keep perspective at a time when the threat is increasingly real  For as long as I can remember I#ve worried, sometimes to the point of obsession, about health. Both my own and the health of those I love. In  I did a course of cognitive behavioural therapy which helped me recognise that my habit of losing hours searching symptoms on Google and rushing to the doctor at the slightest ache or pain was only compounding the problem. It would be better to try to tune out health news updates and think about something  instead.In the context of a potential global pandemic, there#s a cognitive dissonance happening for people like me prone to a dysal level of hypervigilance about health. We try to remind ourselves that hypervigilance is irrational and dysal. Butever vigilance was required and appropriate, it#s now. The public health messages currently being circulated are insisting that the general public exercise unprecedented levels of caution, and world-renowned scientists are going on record to warn us to prepare for the worst-case scenario.The gravity of the situation as Covid- spreads around the world remains unclear. But wherever there is a public health crisis, mental health sequelae are sure to follow. In Hong Kong, one of the worst-affected regions globally, where much of the country is on lockdown, Reuters reported on an unprecedented number of mental health issues becoming apparent. There, where there has been recent social unrest and nightmare memories of the  SARS outbreak remain fresh, a recent survey suggested that as much as a third of the population have symptoms of PTSD and Samaritans Hong Kong have observed a sharp rise in the number of people seeking support. We are, or course, a long way from this scenario here, according to leading mental health expert Paul Fearon. In his view, with three cases confirmed in Northern Ireland and  cases in the Republic at the time of writing, coronavirus is not yet exacting a heavy toll on our mental health. But there a realistic chance it might. We have had previous epidemics which have gone pandemic, so we have some knowledge of things, he explains. We know that people with anxious personalities can become more anxious, understandably. We know that people with anxiety disorders, particularly people with obsessional compulsive disorder, can have an increase in symptoms. You can imagine somebody with OCD, who has a ritual about cleanliness and sanitation,they have a fear of contamination, that their symptoms - hand-washing, whatever it might be - will deteriorate. There#s some evidence that psychotic symptoms, symptoms associated with schizophrenia like delusions, can get worse. And, of course, insomnia and depression can get worse during these phases.Andthe worst happens and a contained threat evolves into a signicant outbreak, Fearon believes an awareness of the psychiatric sequelae, as well as the physical health toll, both for the survivors of the illness and for people who have to self-isolate, will be vital. We also know from the SARS outbreak that, in survivors of SARS, there was an increase in anxiety and depression, panic attacks, psychotic symptoms and even suicidality and delirium, he says. Andsignicant numbers of people are going to have to self-isolate for two weeks or more, there is one research from previous outbreaks about the effects of isolation... there is a whole broad range of psychological and psychiatric sequelae related to both the phase of containment, when people are fearful, and alsothere is an actual outbreak, that need to be taken on board and planned ahead for. He#s at pains to stress though, at the moment, the situation here appears to be contained and that much of the coverage of the issue on social media seems quite alarmist and anxiety-provoking. Part of the problem is our ever-connected way of le. We live in a world now where the availability of information both true and  is just so ever-present in our lives, and we have an expectation to be updated on things and have information at our fingertips, he says. In this context, information-seeking can easily become compulsive. One of the central features of anxiety disorders is an intolerance of uncertainty, and here we are presented with a situation which appears to be spreading worldwide, and where we don#t know everything that we#d like to know about it yet… we don#t know how it#s going to play out. In this context, he says the first most important thing,you are anxious about this, while everybody has concerns about it obviously, is to stick to a trusted source of information. He suggests referring only to the Department of Health website and seeking the single-most reliable source of information. It#s very tempting when you don#t find the answers you want to go to other websites or social media. However, he advises against that there is also an awful lot we can do when we feel helpless. For example, it#s important to focus on the basics by washing your hands and practising good respiratory hygiene.For anyone feeling heightened symptoms of anxiety, he suggests taking a moment to think, #I#m anxious, but is there anybody I know - family, relatives, friends - who might be feeling more anxious than I am # This he says can be a useful way of deflecting some of that anxiety and using it as an almost altruistic, community-spirited way to make sure that those around us are okay. It#s also a good way to avoid feeling isolated. Often when we get anxious about something or scared about something, we clam into ourselves and we let the thoughts escalate, whereaswe are actually talking to someone  who maybe shares similar anxieties or even has more exaggerated anxieties, it can often be a way of distracting yourself from your own anxieties, adds Fearon. Talking through those anxieties, eventhey are shared, is often a way of putting them into perspective.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We brought together the entire scientic team, mobilised as soon as we became aware and then got active, said Prof Duprex.Other teams are working on developing drugs, but vaccines are our game, said the scientist, who graduated from Queen#s University, Belfast, with a joint degree in biochemistry and genetics. He gained his PhD in virology and lectured for  years at the university before moving to the US.Moderna, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company, announced yesterday that it plans to begin human trials on a potential vaccine it is developing using RNA coding.It means there is a vaccine candidate, a step forward, the vaccine research director said, but cautioned that mass doses of a vaccine likely will not be available for a year or more.Prof Duprex said Pittsburgh was chosen as one of the centres to be picked to begin work quickly because of its long history working with viruses. The university is also internationally renowned as the professional home of Jonas Salk, the creator of the polio vaccine.We have a high security containment laboratory where we are able to work with pathogens safely, he said, adding that the centre staff has worked on other high profile viruses, including SARS and MERS.The scientist explained his team first developed cells on which the virus could be grown into millions of particles. Animal-based models to carry out deep lung tests are then produced. While historically the development of vaccines was slow - sometimes taking years as in the case of polio - times have changed with a iety of dferent ways to generate them, the former Lurgan College student said.In the case of the coronavirus, the National Institutes of Healthand the Food and Drug Administration , the regulatory bodies charged with policing trials and reviewing drugs and vaccines, have indicated they will speed up the review process.But Prof Duprex noted that it takes six months for a normal flu vaccine to be developed, tested, reviewed and be available in sufficient amounts to meet demand.We have to be realistic because when you say a vaccine is in development people have to understand what that actually means. It is potentially months, a year, more than a year, probably.The university staff are actively working with other scientists across the globe and co-coordinating with the World Health Organisation .No one#s ego is more important than the public health and we need to be collaborative, Prof Duprex said. There is a sharing of data which is not typical within the world wide scientic community, but it is critical that we are good partners.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A security source said police officers have been standing guard at the station since early February.The Belfasthas chosen not to identy the location of the station but has observed officers carrying out foot patrols in its vicinity.Officers have also been placed at the station#s main entrances as a precaution.The source revealed that the PSNI fears the possible attack may occur during the daytime in an attempt by dissidents to catch officers off-guard.The source went into detail on how the security services believe the attack would most likely be airborne, and probably an improvised mortar device.The PSNI has declined to respond, stating it does comment on operational matters.The latest incident carried out by dissidents took place last December when a suspected grenade was thrown at a police car in west Belfast.It follows a -month period of increasing activity from dissidents. Last September a bomb - described as being in the advanced state of readiness - was made safe by ammunition technical officers after it was found in the Creggan area of Londonderry.A similar attack took place two days earlier which resulted in the PSNI making safe a mortar bomb that had been left close to a police station in Strabane.Last August dissidents used a hoax device to lure police officers and soldiers to a remote rural location at Wattlebridge near the border in Co Fermanagh and then exploded the real bomb.Chief Constable Simon Byrne later laid the blame on Continuity IRA terrorists for the potentially lethal incident.The previous month dissidents tried to murder police officers during an attack in Craigavon, Co Armagh, with a device discovered on Tullygally Road.In July  the New IRA claimed responsibility for a bomb placed under a police officer#s car at Shandon Park Golf Club in east Belfast.The PSNI later released a statement which placed the blame on violent dissident republicans.The latest PSNI security bulletin has revealed there has been an increase in the number of shooting incidents, bombing incidents and paramilitary-style attacks between March  and last month.It also recorded one security-related death - the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, who was killed by a bullet fired by dissidents during rioting in the Creggan in Derry.Also in March dissidents posted five explosive devices posted to locations across the UK, including one sent to Glasgow UniversityMark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland, said yesterday that while he would not comment on the police station threat, any attempt by dissidents to launch an attack is to be roundly condemned. We need an all-out effort by society to isolate such extremism and help the PSNI bring these people before the courts, he said. Officers are resolute in their determination to serve society and it is intolerable that in  we still have to deal with such threats to our police officers.

We must see a radical change in the direction of travel of inspections.I detailed this in a previous policy paper #Reducing the Burden# and how I would like to see inspections reformed.Mr Weir said the culture of inspections had to change, based around three key principles. He added: We need to see a higher trust in the professionalism of teachers and to allow teachers to deliver, and, accompanying with that, a light touch regime when it comes to what monitoring needs to happen. Secondly, we need to reach a point where there is no additional data to be produced, by schools, ahead of any inspection. We should trust teachers as experts in their fields and not just data providers. The best schools are schools which start from the point of self-evaluating.Thirdly, there must be a change in the approach and in relationships. We need to sht away from the current model to an educational improvement service based around collaboration, based around supporting schools, based around mutual respect and generating two way discussions.INTO#s Northern secretary Gerry Murphy said teachers finally have something to look forward to. The round of applause and standing ovation said it all, he said. The burden they have had to put up with, by carrying out a regime which generates so much stress and pressure on top of their already pressured jobs, is unwarranted, unnecessary and unfair.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadBBC#s Stephen Nolan lost #a lot of money# in Flybe takeover DUP condemn threat against Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Alex MaskeyPSNI on high alert over dissident plan for a mortar blitz on Belfast station Quinn director Kevin Lunney makes first public appearance since abduction and tortureMourners told of cleric#s courage in the face of #unendurable# illness ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Almost  million boxes are distributed across Ireland, north and south, each year. www.trocaire.org lentThe appeal this year will help to support women around the world who are struggling to protect their families from intimidation, violence, hunger and drought. As part of the appeal Troacutecaire has launched a report that reveals how woman are disproportionately impacted by climate change and corporate human rights violations throughout the world.The charitys Northern Ireland chief, Siobhan Hanley, said: “‘Women Taking the Lead: Defending Human Rights and the Environment’ details the experiences of courageous women, many of whom are engaged in defending their communities against the effects of corporate greed and the devastating environmental impact of climate change. By contributing to our Lenten Appeal, people in Co Derry will be providing vital aid, care and support to these brave women.”Bertita Zuacutentildeiga Caacuteceres, leader of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organisations of Honduras– an organisation supported by Troacutecaire – attended the launch of the report.Bertita’s mother, Berta Caacuteceres, an internationally renowned activist and winner of the environmental Goldman Prize, was shot dead in  after a long battle to stop construction of an internationally financed hydroelectric dam on the Gualcarque river, which the indigenous Lenca people consider sacred.Bertita was present to speak about her own experience of violence inflicted on female human rights defenders and the indigenous community’s long struggle to defend their land from corporate abuse.While she continues the work of her mother, Bertita is being supported by Troacutecaire in seeking justice to ensure that all those responsible for the murder – the company executives and state officials identied during the resulting trial – are prosecuted.“Around the world, women face huge risks in standing up for their rights in the face of injustice perpetrated by big business taking advantage of vulnerable communities. The threat of assault and murder is a daily reality for many of these women, who are fighting for their families to live better lives,” said Siobhan Hanley.“Women are also disproportionately affected by poverty, which is made worse by the effects of climate change on some of the world’s poorest people. Developing countries carry about % of the cost of the climate crisis, but the poorest populations are responsible for just % of global carbon emissions.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for JPM Contracts said they were honoured to be part of the team which has restored the castle to its former glory.“It is not every day you get to be involved working in a medieval castle, especially of such high signicance,” the spokesperson said.“The work started in March  to replace the existing flat roof which has been in place for the past  years. The new roof is keeping with the late-medieval architecture of the Castle.“It has made from Irish Oak used ‘green’ and oak-pegged without the use of nails or metal fixings.Storm Ophelia“The Irish Oak was sourced from oak trees which came down in Wicklow during Storm Ophelia in October .“The new roof is a series of open trusses and rafters carrying oak boards.“Externally the roof is finished in Cumbrian stone slates and lead.“The external appearance of the Castle does not look signicantly dferent from ground level as the roof is behind the battlements.“However, internally, the Great Hall at the top of the Tower has been transformed into a higher, brighter and more historically resonant space.”Minister for Communities Deirdre Hargey said: “This investment has secured the future of this important monument and prevented irreparable damage to the structure.“Archaeologists and conservation architects within the department worked together to design a historically appropriate roof,” said the Minister.“What has been achieved is an outstanding piece of architecture that safeguards this important and historic place.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoe Clarke, from Ballykelly, is an Engagement Ambassador for VOYPIC and told the County Derry Post that the evening was a great success.She said: “We had a few children singing the Bare Necessities and they had the whole crowd going.“It’s a  to highlight and show appreciation for the talents of these young people that might get bypassed in other areas.“It gives them a chance to stand on that stage and show who they are. One young boy performed his own rap at the event.“It was about being in care, his le at home and his feelings and emotions towards his social workers. Everyone in the room could relate to it.”The -year-old credits the organisation with a great deal of her own success.She said: “I became known to the organisation when I was about   and without them, I don’t think I would be where I am today.“I grew up care experienced and lived on the edge of care my whole le but at , I was made homeless. I lived in Jefferson’s Court on Shipquay Street.“That’s when I became known to VOYPIC, because I wasn’t getting what I was actually entitled to. If you are classied as a LAC, you are provided accommodation by social services.“I wasn’t. I was completely overlooked.”VOYPIC plays a crucial role in making sure that young people in care have access to the support and information they need to make informed decisions about their lives.With offices in Derry, Belfast, Ballymena and Lurgan, another aspect of the charity’s work is filling gaps in the information available to young people in and on the edge of care.Aoe says it is easy for some young people to slip through the cracks.“A lot of young people living on the edge of care can easily fly under the radar and I don’t think information is publicised enough for them to know what they’re entitled to.“I had a really bad experience with the teachers in secondary school because they just didn’t get it at all. It’s hard to expect people to get itthey’ve never received any training.”Aoe is currently in her final year of a psychology degree at Ulster University in Coleraine and, in her role with VOYPIC, is determined to make a dference to those currently re-living her experience.“I’m doing my dissertation on educational pathways to rd level education, specically for care leavers.“A lot of the students I’ve interviewed indicated they weren’t aware of the support available to them – we want to change that.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

Maiden Citys front  however was trying to break down a sturdy Ballymoney rearguard all afternoon with wave after wave of attacks from the outset.First to test the keeper on  minutes was Garbhan Feeney who cut in from the left and drove a fierce shot that the Ballymoney shot stopper was equal to.Bobby Sweeney always looking to get on the ball to make things happen for City was the driving force in midfield feeding the over lapping full backs Feeney and Moore but with the wind really swirling about now it was hard for any player to judge were the ball was going to fall.Peter Tracey was next to break up an attempted counter attack from Ballymoney on  minutes he played in Harrigan whos drive was always raising over the bar. googletag.cmd.push HT - City now playing with the wind in the second half immediately took the lead after the restart.Mark Toland with great work down the right beat  defenders and put a pinpoint cross onto the foot of Shae Feeney who made no mistake from  yards.From this point it looked like it was only a matter of time until Maiden City scored again only for Ballymoney to equalise with their only meaningful attack of the game. A long ball and a bit of pinball in the box allowed Taggart to lash the loose ball past Farrell to make it -.Grimley and Melaugh were mere spectators as the City onslaught on the Ballymoney goal was intensying. With  minutes remaining Sean Harrigan fired a low shot towards the backpost which the keeper parried into the path of substitute Dylan McGavigan who finished with a plum only for the referee to adjudge McGavigan was offside.Indeed it was the lively McGavigan again who in the final minute skipped past the Ballymoney full back who appeared to trip him inside the box only for the referee to point for a goal kick and not to the penalty spot to the dismay of City players. googletag.cmd.push TeamsOisin Farrell, Conor Moore, Cahir Grimley, Cahir Melaugh, Ruadhan Feeney, Peter Tracey, Bobby Sweeney, Garbhan Feeney, Shae Feeney, Mark Toland, Sean Harrigan.Subs- Keiran Kelpie, Calum Murphy, Dylan McGavigan, Sevan Albay, Ethan Doherty  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners. A best kept garden competition is another idea.The town committee hopes to tie all the events into Down Councilrsquos anti-litter campaign later this year when a prize of pound will be awarded to the best kept town or village in the council area.Some members of the town committee, however, fear Killyleagh could get off to a bad start in the competition because of the major housing redevelopment schemes at Shore Street and Irish Street, and the overall shabby appearance of roads and footpaths in the area.DUNDRUM mdash Ambitious plans to make Dundrum Regatta and Sports bigger and better were drawn at the Regatta Committeersquos annual meeting in the Bay Inn on Monday night.Ideas to cater for teenagers, introduce a more ied programme and revert to a date in mid July were considered at the well attended meeting.Before the election of officers, which saw Mr Hugh Graham re-elected as chairman and Mr Pierce Rice appointed secretary, the committee congratulated Mr Dan McNeill for his -year association with the committee,  of which were spent as chairman.One of the more pleasing aspects to come out of the meeting was the formation of a group, to be known as the teenage committee, which will should out what teenagers want to see in the programme of events, this ensuring young, middle-aged and elderly will be catered for. The dates for this yearrsquos Regatta are July -.LOUGHINISLAND mdash Loughinisland hasnrsquot had a public phone kiosk since it was knocked down by a lorry three years ago.

The local development association say they have been conned mdash and  residents agree with them.The row relates to the possible side effects of the Department of the Environmentrsquos scheme to meet the townrsquos needs on whig work began last year and was abandoned a few months ago.For more than ten years there has been intense opposition to a sewerage collection tank located close to the townrsquos slipway.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies.

Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

Indeed, the document contained a promise to walk away from talks in June, unless the ‘broad outline’ of a trade deal is already in place. That will give the government time to ‘focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion’.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...To you or me, that means they will be getting ready for a possible no-deal outcome, and it could easily include preparing infrastructure to carry out checks at Irish Sea ports.This seeming acceptance of the Northern Ireland protocol is at odds with Boris Johnson’s rhetoric about ‘unfettered access’ between all parts of the UK market. And it doesn’t tally with reports that the prime minister has instructed his Brexit team to draw up plans to avoid implementing checks on goods moving from Great Britain to NI.The EU certainly believes that Johnson must start erecting a border in the Irish Sea. Michel Barnier described checks between the mainland and Northern Ireland as an ‘indispensable’ element of the Withdrawal Agreement.That document effectively requires Northern Ireland to remain in the single market, for goods and agriculture at least, as the rest of the country leaves at the end of the year. In addition, we must continue to apply the EU customs code and, by default, that means businesses here paying up-front tarfs on goods they bring in from Great Britain for processing.Extraordinarily, the DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson told the BBC this week that customs checks could represent an ‘opportunity’ for businesses in Northern Ireland. He dismissed the notion that a customs border has implications for British sovereignty here. Now, even the biggest unionist party seems prepared to go along with this ‘best of both worlds’ hokum. In fact, although the protocol may seem rather technical, it’s likely to affect every single person living here. This week, The ’s Brexit Bulletin reported that a major supermarket estimates that the price of ferrying a trailer of groceries to Northern Ireland could go up by %, or £, per consignment, thanks to potential new administration and veterinary costs. It’s inconceivable that such drastic price rises will not be passed on to consumers.The government continues to deny that the protocol will have such drastic consequences. The new secretary of state, Brandon Lewis, claims, “there will not be a border down the Irish Sea, there will be unfettered access for business”, while a Downing Street statement asserts there will be “limited changes” to trade between GB and NI. In the House of Lords, Treasury minister, Lord Agnew, told Lord Empey that some “light touch regulation” may be needed.All these terms — ‘unfettered access’, ‘limited changes’ and ‘light-touch regulation’ — are vague enough to allow the government to simply downplay the scale of any disruption rather than prevent it. Meanwhile, The Sunday Times, reports that a senior Downing Street source says “there is deadly serious internal work going on about not obeying the Northern Ireland protocol”. The implication is that Johnson knows fine well that the Withdrawal Agreement includes checks on goods, an internal-UK trade border and other features that, to a layman, appear to be in the document in black and white.The paper claims that Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general, was replaced by Suella Braverman during the cabinet reshuffle because he was not prepared to issue advice that allowed the government to reinterpret the Northern Ireland protocol. It looks like the prime minister is searching for a legal rationale to back up his insistence that the deal doesn’t require checks between Great Britain and Ulster. At best, it’s a risky, counterintuitive strategy,For unionists who aren’t Jeffrey Donaldson, it’s might seem like a relief that Johnson at least recognises that there is a problem with the protocol. Northern Ireland sells four times more goods to Great Britain than it exports to the Republic, so it’s perverse that the focus of our politicians and lobbyists was on preventing any hardening of the Irish land border rather than avoiding trade barriers in the Irish Sea. It was glaringly obvious that the Withdrawal Agreement threatened to cut Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK. The easiest way to avoid the worst barriers to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is still to sign a comprehensive trade deal with the EU evenit’s understandable that British negotiators don’t wish to appear too desperate to achieve that outcome.Maybe the government can devise a plan to avoid the worst aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, but it doesn’t seem likely. If the prime minister really is making an effort to escape the Northern Ireland protocol, and unionists would be naive to take that for granted, why on earth did he sign up to it in the first place \"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Speaking to the East Belfast Herald newspaper at his Cregagh home in , he said he was unsurethe call-up could be legally enforced, but decided to enlist in case he would be subsequently directed to serve with the Navy. What happened next took the Belfast bakery worker on an epic journey through France and into southern Germany via the Haardt Mountains and Hitler’s ‘eagle’s nest’ mountain base at Berchtesgaden.As the war drew to a close in , Teddy’s unit was involved in the capture of Hitler’s deputy – Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering – in Austria, and it was the newly-promoted Sergeant Dixon who dispatched to check out reports of a salt mine filled with priceless artworks, and then tasked with guarding the treasures at Salzburg Castle.Members of Teddy’s family have travelled thousands of miles to be with him this weekend for a busy round of birthday celebrations, including a family lunch in the local church hall on Saturday and a hotel buffet event in his honour on Sunday evening.US Army veteran Teddy Dixon got the VIP treatment at Movie House Dublin Road in  when he came in to watch The Monuments Men starring George Clooney and Matt Damon. Picture: John Murphy Aurora PAThe much-loved centenarian is in good spirits and will be reliving some of the many highlights of his amazing le surrounded by family and friends, but the shock of discovering thousands of Holocaust victims in  has never left him. The dead had been packed into train carriages as the Nazis attempted to move the evidence of war crimes further away from the advancing Allies. “I was one of the first  soldiers to enter the gates of Dachau camp on April  and can still see the bodies in my mind’s eye,” Teddy recalled in .“The dead were lying everywhere and the smell was indescribable. We found one man who had been left for dead in a carriage but was still alive and we got him some medical attention. We gave our rations to as many of those who could eat but it was too late for several who died in front of our eyes.“It was like going into Hell.”Teddy Dixon at home in East Belfast ahead of his th birthday on May . Photo: Laura Davison Pacemaker PressSpeaking to the News Letter in , he said the vivid memories would never leave him, but he continued to carry out speaking engagements to raise awareness of the warning from history.“I still like doing the talks in schools but it can annoy you a bit sometimes when you think about it. Many a time when I wake up I find I’ve been dreaming about the Holocaust,” he added.But thankfully Teddy can recall many happier times during his eventful  years – including countless honours and awards from Holocaust survivors, the US Government and Belfast City Council,His wartime memories include partying on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on the first Bastille Day after liberation from the Germans in July .Teddy Dixon aged  in his US Army unormThe le-long member or Orange lodge LOL in Sandy Row had been granted leave from tracking down war criminals in Austria and was on his way home for the Twelfth – but got stranded in the French capital due to the decimation of the rail infrastructure.In more recent times, the Big Lottery Fund paid for Teddy to travel back to Dachau to commemorate the th anniversary of the liberation. • With Teddy Dixon’s war record reading like the plot of a Hollywood film, it was no surprise that George Clooney brought one of the Belfast man’s adventures to le in a blockbuster movie.The Monuments Men, released in , was based on the story of theNazis’ looted art treasures Teddy helped recover from an Austrian salt mine. Each one of thousands of priceless artworks – including Michelangelo’s ‘Madonna of Bruges’ sculpture and Vermeer’s painting ‘The Astronomer’ – had been packed on to several train carriages and hidden in the mine close to Altaussee. At the film’s launch, the then -year-old Teddy was a Movie House cinema guest for a special screening in Belfast. He told the News Letter afterwards: “I enjoyed it. It was definitely based on fact and quite well done based on my point of view of having been in the mines.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
