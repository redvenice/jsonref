I’m so grateful that they’re giving all people a place to worship.\u0027On June 1, the first day of Pride Month, Swift took to Instagram with a lengthy post, in which she wished her fans a happy Pride Month, then took the opportunity to encourage people to write letters to their senators explaining why they should pass the Equality Act, which had already been passed by the House.She accompanied the post with an image of the letter that she had written Tennessee senator, Republican Lamar Alexander.That same night, Swift performed at an iHeart Wango Tango concert in Los Angeles while wearing a rainbow colored outfit, encouraging fans to contact their senators to appeal to them about passing the Equality Act, according to Reuters.Taylor Swift¿s Surprise Performance at Stonewall Inn (Watch) ¿ VarietyTaylor Swift Wishes NYC\u0027s Stonewall Inn \u0027Happy Pride\u0027 at Surprise Set | BillboardTaylor Swift\u0027s Pride anthem leads to \u0027influx\u0027 of GLAAD donationsTaylor Swift Makes $113,000 Donation to Tennessee LGBTQ Advocacy Group ¿ Rolling StoneGLAAD on Twitter: \u0026quotYou could be GLAAD with a limited edition sticker invoking @taylorswift13\u0027s lyrics from #YouNeedToCalmDown.

The work is displayed in venues across Madrid, and in a further six cities, until 1 September PhotoEa, Madrid’s annual celebration of photography, offers an extensive programme of exhibitions to suit all tastes. The work of established figures such William Klein, Berenice Abbott, and Manuel Álvarez Bravo is on display alongside shows introducing young, emerging European photographers. The subjects of the exhibitions are equally erse, ranging from rare Soviet photobooks to snapshots bought on eBay, from collective projects decades in the making to solo undertakings completed in months.Among the many highlights is a comprehensive overview of photography projects by Stephen Shore, Josef Koudelka, Lewis Baltz, Sophie Ristelhueber and Raymond Depardon, who were officially commissioned to chart the changing landscapes of Europe from the early 1980s to the present day. Two exhibitions celebrate Donna Ferrato’s tireless work in combating domestic abuse. And the late Leila Alaoui’s sympathetic portraits of The Moroccans are displayed to sober effect at Casa Árabe.At the heart of the festival are five exhibitions of art photography, gathered under the heading deja vu because of their dependence on antecedent traditions, ideas and works, which reflect on the current nature, limits and possibilities of the medium. Elina Brotherus, for example, produces work that engages with the legacy of conceptual art of the 1960s and 70s. Clare Strand makes painted versions of tabloid photographs. Patrick Pound and Délio Jasse reinterpret archival material to radically different ends. Laura Letinsky and Sharon Core use the still life as a means of raising questions about genre, tradition and reproduction.A vibrant retrospective of the work of the US photographer William Klein presents his pictures in a display as energetic, innovative and brash as the photographs themselves. Included here are rarely seen early paintings as a student of Fernand Léger, uncompromising street photography, iconoclastic fashion work, starkly abstract scientific studies, painted contact sheets and vivid film work.For more than 10 years, Javier Vallhonrat has explored, studied and photographed the Maladeta glacier in the Pyrenees. The duration of the project, the intensity of its focus and the rigour of the fieldwork are evident in the imposing and magisterial works on show. Aerial imagery outlines the development of the Maladeta over time. And ground level pictures, assembled as collages, reveal the scarred surfaces of the glacier. Their presentation suggests tectonic plates perhaps, and the fragmentary nature of Vallhonrat’s subjectElina Brotherus exhibits a body of work that follows the protocols and strictures of conceptual artists of the 1960s and 70s, especially the Fluxus group. Her photographs are records of her staged enactments of proposals, or “scores”, issued by the group as guides for artistic practice. Self-expression, artistic freedom and autobiography are thereby reined in. Like all good conceptualists, Brotherus appears impeccably deadpan throughout, though she did confide that there was plenty of off-camera laughter between shoots.Collector Patrick Pound curates an exhibition of vintage photographs of erse subjects thematically unified by the show’s invisible focus, air. Flags, wind instruments, hot air balloons and wind-blown hair abound in a playful show that attests to Pound’s wit and imagination – and to the power of Google image searches and eBay.Offland showcases eight young European photographers, among them Eirini Vourloumis and Myrto Papadopoulos, whose work addresses, to varying degrees, themes of imagined Arcadias, refuge and identity. Papadopoulos’s understated yet compelling pictures focus on Greece’s Pomak minority and the women left behind by husbands who have emigrated to northern Europe for economic reasons. Vourloumis’s poignant series The Mermaid Madonna draws parallels between historically remote episodes of migration from Turkey to the island of Lesbos in the Aegean.Délio Jasse exhibits two bodies of work, Lost Chapter Nampula – 1963 and Nova Lisboa. Both combine documents salvaged from a Lisbon flea market with archival photographs of the family lives of Europeans in colonial Africa. Official stamps and lettering overlay and often obscure the monochromatic domestic scenarios. Jasse gives potent pictorial form to the integration of institutional forces, personal lives and colonial history"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db28ea76445f0d11d65dd2315ab42bbd5aa6bc66/0_90_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f49f24cd9881f2e256b96987c676067","title":"hunger games prequel book movie","story":"Suzanne Collins has written a book set in Panem 64 years before the original dystopian trilogy and Lionsgate has confirmed interest in adapting it for the big screenSuzanne Collins is writing a prequel to her best-selling Hunger Games trilogy with a potential movie adaptation also on the way.The currently untitled book will be released in May 2020 and will be set in the world of Panem 64 years before the events of the dystopian franchise. It will focus on the time after the so-called “Dark Days,”, a failed rebellion.“With this book, I wanted to explore the state of nature, who we are, and what we perceive is required for our survival,” Collins said in a statement. “The reconstruction period 10 years after the war, commonly referred to as the Dark Days – as the country of Panem struggles back to its feet – provides fertile ground for characters to grapple with these questions and thereby define their views of humanity.”The Hunger Games books, which focus on a world where teenagers must fight to the death as a form of entertainment, were adapted into a globally successful big-screen franchise starring Jennifer Lawrence as heroine Katniss Everdeen. The four films have made almost $3bn at the box office and Lionsgate has expressed interest in extending the franchise as well.“As the proud home of the Hunger Games movies, we can hardly wait for Suzanne’s next book to be published,” said Joe Drake, Lionsgate chairman. “We’ve been communicating with her during the writing process and we look forward to continuing to work closely with her on the movie.”In 2017, a Hunger Games theme park opened in Dubai, with attractions including a Capitol bullet train rollercoaster, the hall of heroes, and the Panem aerial tour multimedia experience. This summer, a Lionsgate theme park is set to open in China that will feature a 3D motion simulator attraction pegged to the final film.The original books were all New York Times bestsellers upon release, selling more than 65m copies in the US alone and translated into 51 languages for 56 territories. Since then, Collins has released an autobiographical picture book called Year of the Jungle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5cd04bb92bbf6199e1013c85d856c78d26d735c/0_408_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19a5f7678274dc12d39890fbf255de46","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.A foundational work to start with. Aeschylus’ Oresteia has awed paulburns:I’m a bit overwhelmed by its brilliance, even though I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve read it. Translated by Robert Fagles, one marvels at its poetic grandeur and religious ritual, especially in Agamemnon, the first play of the cycle, Though that reaches a dramatic height with Agamemnon’s murder by Clytemnestra. The second play, The Libation Bearers, where Orestes decides to murder his mother in revenge for her murder of Agamemnon, moves more quickly, and, to my mind, reads better. The final play, The Eumenides, is the most frightening. Legend has it that the dance and chant where the Furies called down revenge on Orestes had women fainting in the audience. (I’d bet the men were shivering in their boots as well.) There was nothing to match it in world literature until Shakespeare wrote the witches’ scenes in Macbeth.Wow, I’m still a little discombobulated with that one, which is rarely a bad sign. The book didn’t really go at all how I expected it to. The direction of the narrative set in the first 50 or so pages preordained a certain finish, but the end was not what I had foreseen. Those closing pages really just knocked me on my ass ever so slightly.Millingabout is “deep into” Jerusalem by Alan Moore:It is apparently one of the longest novels ever written, which explains the tissue thin papers and small text. My god, is it good. Part anthropological dig into the residents of “The Boroughs” of Northampton, part historical fiction, part fantasy, and a deep delve into life, death and the afterlife that serves as the veins of the story. Jerusalem blends real life and fiction perfectly, it truly is Moore’s magnum opus. Out of all of the fascinating, mad, dark tales the author has given us, truly this is a story to rival Chaucer’s Tales. It feels like the type of story that should be broken up into parts and retold as folk tales for centuries to come. Highly recommended.An unusual experience for CCCubbon, when dipping into The World Turned Upside Down by Christopher Hill:This morning I dug out Hill’s excellent book on the radical ideas of groups such as Levellers, Seekers, Ranters, Diggers and Fifth Modernists, sects like Quakers, Baptists and Muggletonians … But here’s the strangest thing. Something I had not noticed before. This paperback was published by Penguin in 1991. I must have picked it up in some secondhand bookshop one day and I wanted to look up a reference to Sir Isaac Newton and his belief in alchemy, page 290, when I noticed that page 288 had a different typeface. Checking further, all the pages from 240 were in the same different typeface, in fact, after 240 the page number was 129. How odd. Investigating further, I discovered that a section from a different book was included (129-160) this is from Unweaving the Rainbow by Richard Dawkins. Pages 240-288 of Hill’s book missing. I have never come across such a thing before and wonder if every 1991 edition has the same error?“I have read Old Filth by Jane Gardam,” says lonelybloomer “and I’m in love”:It is exactly the book I was looking for. What a treat to find there are two more in the trilogy! Feeling positively energised and happy with my reading habit.ChronicExpat has just finished The Hanged Man of Saint-Pholien by Georges Simenon (translated by Linda Coverdale):My, what a strange, surreal little book it is! As I read, I couldn’t help envisioning it as a black-and-white New Wave film, filled with shadowy lighting, rapid scene changes and long tracking shots… I am enjoying my initial forays into the world of Maigret very much. Given how many of them there are, of course, I shall have to pick up the pace if I intend to get through all of them: there are 73 novels left (not to mention the short stories) which, at my current rate of three a year, will take me another 24 years to get through … and I rather think I’ll be lucky to live that long.This week every year I take Ulysses down from the shelf and read three or four pages from each of the 18 chapters. It’s a ritual I enjoy more with each passing year and my admiration for Joyce’s masterpiece grows accordingly. Such a wonderful affirmation of words, of language, and ultimately, of our humanity. It is a novel that has never been bettered and I will be forever grateful to Joyce for completing it and to Sylvia Beach for publishing it.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

We explored in depth whether next year’s Olympics can live up to the 1964 games, how Tokyo is bracing itself for its next once-in-a century earthquake, and how life is changing for women in the city.We asked you for your thoughts on how the city’s changed, and for your comments on our coverage.Here’s what you told us:In response to our report by the ’s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, on whether the city is opening up to the outside world, Lou, who has lived in Tokyo for 20 years, said:Tokyo is changing, but not for the better. Many old, beautiful traditions are dying out. Young people aren’t upholding them. English is infiltrating and the result is not good – the Japanese language is chock full of random, annoying English words.Mass immigration will be the nail in the coffin. Japan will be ‘globalised’ and its traditions relegated to tourist spots. Why do we want Tokyo to be like London? What is so great about Tokyo ‘finally opening up’? The whole world is becoming a homogenous lump. Where will the tourists go then?”On social media we asked readers to share their hopes and fears for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. @kakiandbambino said he hoped no-one - players, staff or spectators – dies due to heatstroke.’s athetics correspondent, Sean Ingle, reported from the city on whether Tokyo 2020 can live up to 1964’s Olympic legacy: “Such was the event’s success that it has set the bar dazzlingly high for Tokyo 2020.”Toby Miller got in touch to highlight the darker side of those games. He said the 1964 Tokyo Olympics was “an environmental and human, classic Cold-War disaster”. Miller, author of Greenwashing Sport, describes environment destruction caused by the construction of the high-speed rail link between Osaka and Tokyo.The canals, sea, and rivers below the railway were inundated with concrete and landfill, and a centuries-old field of seaweed destroyed. Water stagnated, sludge emerged, and sea life perished. Estuaries turned into cesspools andor were transformed into roads. The tramway system was virtually destroyed in favor of freeways and cars became dominant. Clearance of living things saw hundreds of thousands of homeless cats and dogs killed by the state. As with all very rapid, massive modernizations, from the US through the Soviet Union to China, this transformation was achieved through violence in this case, the horror of war and its detritus, followed by preferential Cold-War terms.”Mid-week a curious email landed in our inbox. The subject line was “Tokyo’s Floating Stadium”, and it was sent from Florian Busch Architects, in Shibuya-ku. It announced:After several plans to build a new National Stadium for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo had been cancelled, the embarrassment was redeemed by an almost happy ending. In July of 2020, the New National Stadium, a ship, anchored under Odaiba’s Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo became the first host of an era of a newfound Olympic spirit.”This “floating stadium” was a groundbreaking architectural feat that would travel the world, from one Olympic city to the next.It also wasn’t real, but in fact an elaborate tease devised by the architect firm “in response to the mess surrounding the Olympic stadium”.We asked readers to share their thoughts about how Tokyo was changing. Laurence Williams, associate professor in the Faculty of Foreign Studies at Sophia University, a private university in Chiyoda ward in central Tokyo, said:Japanese academia is much more open to non-Japanese professors than it used to be. Tokyo itself is erse and exciting and this is a great time to be working in the city. Numbers of international students are rising sharply (because of demographic decline, universities are increasingly looking abroad). Most international students are still from elsewhere in Asia, although USUKEurope numbers are rising.”Susannah, who lives in Shibuya, sent in this photo of the Imperial Palace from across the water, and writes: “This is just after New Years, and shows an impressive contrast between nature, old Japan, and new Japan.”David Chart wrote in to say that he served on Kawasaki City committees dealing with issues affecting foreign residents, and reckons the treatment of them hasn’t changed. A couple of years ago he helped organise a survey of foreign residents living in Kawasaki to find out problems they were facing. In a blogpost at the time about the survey results, he said the Japanese police occasionally single out foreigners due to their race, and ask them questions, and “sometimes they make them call their mothers”. He told  Cities: “The composition of the foreign population has changed a lot even while I have been here, but the problems they face have changed much less. Is this racism? Yes, but not, I think, in a straightforward way.On Tuesday we published an investigation by  Cities and the Waseda Chronicle into how Tokyo’s suburban housing became vast ghettoes for elderly people. Reader Lewis Parley wrote in to say:Your article about the aging population of Tokyo’s suburban housing estates was very informative. I think it would be beneficial to the series if you contrast this phenomenon with the renaissance some more central public housing estates are experiencing due to the influx of immigrant families ( Chinese in Kawaguchi, Indian Bangladeshi in Ojima, Koto-ku and Kasai, Edogawa-ku). By also featuring these places, I think you’d give the reader a more balanced picture of the changes Tokyo’s population is experiencing.”During the week, people shared photos of their favourite and suprising Tokyo scenes on Twitter and Instagram, such as these posts:Trevor Skingle got in touch to describe the tension he’d observed between modernisation, and the desire to preserve the city’s heritage.Take for instance the old ‘Habutae Dango’ that was located near Nippori Station with its 200-year-old history as a tea house and dango (sweet dumpling shop), a favourite haunt of the poet Masaoka Shiki and the author Natsume Soseki, and repository of a few Shogitai relics from the 1868 Battle of Ueno. Each time I visited Tokyo I would make a point of visiting to enjoy their dango and matcha green tea whilst at the same time contemplating the wonderful garden view available only to patrons only to find on my visit in 2018 that it had become a building site.”On the other hand, he adds: “As a Tokyo history buff I am astonished at some of the historical finds that I’ve made which are still there.” Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

I never thought parliament would tell me to choose between being an MP and being a mum. My Labour colleague Tulip Siddiq was forced to postpone a C-section so she could cast a vote in the debate on Theresa May’s Brexit deal in January and that caused a rightful outcry. Westminster can – when it wants – make it possible to combine parenthood with legislating and Siddiq’s push for progress on a system that would have allowed her to vote by proxy demonstrates it. But allowing an MP to nominate someone to vote on their behalf when they need to be at home with their children is just one piece of a much bigger equality puzzle.During my first miscarriage, aching and bleeding, I joined a protest for the extradition of a man who had raped and murdered a constituent. The day after I found out that another baby’s heartbeat had stopped, I led a public meeting on gang crime. I even scheduled the procedure to remove the body on a day I didn’t have a constituency advice surgery. Heartbroken by all the years that I have struggled with fertility, I’ve kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected.Now I’m pregnant once more and terrified – not just that it will go wrong again, but because I know that my resolve to keep my private and professional lives separate has become impossible. I’m coming forward publicly to talk about it because, as for far too many women, the personal inevitably becomes political when reproduction is involved.The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) is the independent body that since 2009 has, on behalf of taxpayers, regulated the pay of MPs and authorised the budgets we claim for our work. Ipsa has a duty to ensure that we are resourced appropriately to carry out parliamentary duties. But it says it does not “recognise” that MPs go on maternity leave. Thus, it feels no responsibility to make provision for any paid cover for what we do outside the parliamentary chamber: the campaigns, constituency casework and municipal work that all MPs do. Harriet Harman wrote movingly of trying to cover constituency duties with babies in tow in the 1980s. Despite warm words about maternity cover two years ago from Ipsa, things have gone backwards. Humiliatingly, it is making me beg for extra staff funding – or give up any chance of spending time with my child to make sure my constituents don’t miss out. If a GP or vicar were on leave, a locum would be provided to ensure continuity of community services. In Denmark a member of the national parliament would have a substitute MP appointed. My experience is not unique. Other MPs who have had children since Ipsa was created have told me of the same rejection of their requests for help on the basis that MPs “do not take maternity leave”. Siddiq herself had to return to doing casework three days after a C-section. Some MPs have tried to be with their newborn child at least for a few weeks, hoping residents don’t notice their absence and the correspondence doesn’t pile up too much, or begging colleagues to cover casework. Several have ended up taking their children with them to meetings so they can feed them, with constituents acting as proxy babysitters while trying to talk to their representative.No community should miss out on representation because its MP is pregnant – nor should my opponents be able to argue there’s a cost to my constituents because I may succeed in my quest to conceive. For all the talk of being family friendly, Westminster is still struggling to offer deeds instead of words. And if we can’t get this right for MPs, how can we get this right for parents elsewhere?Britain still has a long way to go to ensure that fertility isn’t a barrier to equality. A third of employers think it’s acceptable to ask women about their plans for having a family at a job interview. Non-disclosure agreements are used frequently to cover up pregnancy discrimination, with the legal advice service Pregnant Then Screwed receiving on average 350 calls a year. This inequality isn’t just in the workplace. Fertility treatment is a minefield in terms of access and quality, leading many to go abroad. If thousands of Brits went overseas for experimental optometry, it would be a national priority to ensure no one returned blind. But women are left to congregate in online chatrooms to share IVF reviews and pricing plans, as a commercial industry supplants public provision in a way we wouldn’t accept with any other branch of healthcare.Increasingly, our bodies are the battlefield of political change. We need to bring together the fight for the right to reproduce and the right not to do so – not least because in these Trump-inspired times those who seek to control women find it politically expedient. In Georgia, Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana I would potentially have faced a criminal investigation to ensure I had not caused my own miscarriages because they were later than their six-week abortion deadline. Our own government forces women to continue unwanted pregnancies by retaining an outright ban on abortion in Northern Ireland.Prejudices and unhelpful tropes about motherhood suffocate female representatives – whether we have children or not – in a way that is rarely true for our male counterparts. For my work on abortion rights I have been trolled relentlessly with the charge that it is my own childlessness that drives my “desire to kill other people’s babies”.Campaigners opposed to providing LGBT sex and relationship education in schools once surrounded me in my constituency screaming that I didn’t have children of my own, so how could I understand their concerns. My political opponents have printed campaign leaflets highlighting their candidates’ motherhood and marriage to demonstrate how I was deficient. When I talk to male colleagues – whether fathers or not – none of this behaviour even rings a bell.Achieving a world in which women are not discriminated against because they can carry children means challenging all of these attitudes – and the policies that go with them. From the parliamentary authorities to our healthcare services and workplaces, it’s time to stop asking nicely for the discrimination to be dealt with. It is time to refuse to wait patiently and instead to make it a a priority. As a politician I’ve never stopped fighting for women to have control over their own bodies through the provision of reproductive rights and services as the non-negotiable prerequisite of equality. As a pregnant woman this recent experience is another bitter reminder that it’s still often men – this time the Ipsa executives – who will make the choices that determine if that battle will be won.• Stella Creasy is the Labour and Co-operative MP for Walthamstow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac48596fb689a467e9fc2deb0c033e355a99101b/0_125_3937_2362/master/3937.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a36be95aee8de68271e1768c1b0443d2","title":"the guardian view on a brexit election the unicorns are back","story":"Because the electorate is the Tory party membership, it might make sense at this time to give full attention to the party over the competing claims of government and the nation. The trouble is that rather than doing so in a sensible manner, the contest to succeed Theresa May has seen candidates taking up surreal positions. This will have deleterious consequences for the nation. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who at one point had been sane enough to warn hard Brexiters that leaving the EU without a deal was “not a policy choice available to the next prime minister”, dropped out and backed Mr Johnson, who thinks it is.There is no taxi ride to the door of No 10, where once the electoral fare has been paid there are no further obligations. All the potential candidates for the top job in the country must understand that their words will catch up with them. Their utterances will be used not just by their opponents, but also by allies required to prop up a minority government led by an unelected prime minister in charge of a party that remains at war with itself. It is natural for a PM to seek personal gratification in politics. But a leader must also have the patience to listen to the sentiments of people whom it may be imprudent to neglect but a bore to consult. It’s long been clear that Mr Johnson lacks such a skill set, preferring instead to dole out partisan cheer.Grassroots Conservatives can hardly be said to be representative of the country as a whole, either demographically or ideologically. Mr Johnson’s supporters seem to be socially conservative no-dealers who want less talk of climate change. The pathogen of Euroscepticism in the Conservative party has taken to living in the party’s gut, and has to a large extent stopped its host absorbing food. This has meant the Tories have been unable to ingest all that Brexit involves. What is clear is that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated. It might be possible to lightly amend the agreement in some cosmetic way, but such an offer would fall short of the extravagant promises made on the campaign trail.Mr Johnson is not shaping a trend, he is following one. It is a concern that a majority of Britons think the country “needs a strong leader willing to break the rules”. Tellingly, Mr Johnson last year pondered in a event with Tory activists how Donald Trump would get Brexit done. It was not encouraging. “He’d go in bloody hard,” Mr Johnson said. “There’d be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he’d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere.” The frontrunner has set the pace for the pack. Like lemmings at the cliff’s edge, Tory candidates are now steeped in denial of the risks they face. This will end very badly for the UK, and the Conservative party will have no one to blame but itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d16f0bd134e1f480fc47079a98a553f9f5c568d/81_288_4509_2705/master/4509.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4451a2a99b384a7a61d1f5a1d8ccc59c","title":"theresa may brexit referendum","story":"The obscene sight of Tory leadership candidates splashing out cash by the bucketload is just one of the head-clutching, this-can’t-be-happening unbelievables of this extraordinary time. Spaffing it up the wall doesn’t begin to express the revolting spectacle of wild tax cuts and eye-catching gimmicks from the same austerians who garrotted every public service. Theresa May is the biggest spender, spraying goodbye billions on mental health, schools, colleges and a zero-carbon pledge, while Philip Hammond’s Treasury declares it “immoral” to steal from the emergency no-deal fund. What does she care? She is taking her revenge on them all.But if May wants revenge, she has the power to blow away all her obstructors, tormentors and detractors, all 80 European Research Groupers, all those who blocked her deal. Who knows the dark recesses of her mind, this locked-in woman incapable of communication? Although the Mail on Sunday report on her has a ring of plausibility. She will keep her Commons seat, she voted for Rory Stewart and she “privately vowed to thwart any attempt by Boris Johnson to take the UK out of the EU without a deal”. (Never mind that her mantra was “no deal is better than a bad deal”.)Soon Johnson will be strapped into her straitjacket, his phantom pregnancy of a new deal over. Nigel Farage and the ERG leer threateningly as the no-deal abyss beckons, with the pandemonium of border blockages, shortages of fuel, food and medicines and an Irish border shutdown.Parliament will prevent it, one way or another: the Speaker, John Bercow, guarantees it. Only 10 brave Tory MPs voted for Jeremy Corbyn’s motion last week to block no deal. But in October, on the brink of no deal, when Labour calls a vote of no confidence to bring down the Johnson government, many more Tories will join them – the likes of Philip Hammond, David Gauke, Amber Rudd and others now in government including, it is suggested, May herself, will bring the final curtain down on their own party. Justine Greening, one of the brave, reckons as many as 50 would do the deed. Dominic Grieve says it would only need about six, and he has those. A question hangs over the disgraceful 21 Labour MPs who voted or abstained to permit no deal last week: surely they would vote no confidence in Johnson?May, looking for a legacy before her 24 July departure, must be asking herself this: if she would bring down a Tory government to save her country, why not take action sooner? She has the power. She could press the nuclear option and revoke article 50, ending the Brexit trauma at a stroke: quite a legacy.But the outrage would be terrifying, with leavers now more furious at denial of their democratic vote than about leaving the EU. So instead she could put her own referendum bill before parliament. Greening suggests a ranking of three preferences – no deal, May’s deal, or remain. May can say with conviction that too much is being decided behind closed doors by a tiny Tory electorate: democracy demands the people, not the Tory party, decide what comes next. She would, the Tory rebels think, get it through parliament quite easily, forcing the winner of this leadership charade to give the people the final say. That might even be a relief.Remainers might well lose the referendum – people might choose no deal. But so be it, they will at least know the price. Last time, no deal was never even mentioned.Johnson could grab the initiative, calling a snap election in full victory bounce before his unicorn Brexit plan is exposed, before Farage can claim “betrayal”. But how much better if May obliged him to call a referendum too. Tories are selecting him as their best hope to stop votes leaching to Farage, but analyst of Tory fortunes Tim Bale warns that he may not do well with the rest of the electorate. The “Boris brand” – Heineken man, who used to reach across party ides – morphed when he turned hard Brexiteer in 2016 – anti-immigration, lying about 80 million Turks and fibbing on NHS funds. Now he reaches mainly his own kind, and Farage will be warning that Johnson can never be trusted, and only the Brexit party will keep him straight. That fear has started Tory donors in secret talks for a Tory-Farage electoral pact, claims the : Tories would stand aside for Brexit candidates in northern towns.That should frighten the life out of Labour: the Tory-Brexit party split is Labour’s route to power. At a crucial shadow cabinet meeting tomorrow, Keir Starmer, Tom Watson, Andy McDonald, Emily Thornberry and many others will press hard for Labour to get off the fence, with full-throated backing for a referendum and remain. Skewered in recent elections for facing both ways, Labour needs to interrupt this Tory leadership parade of Brexiteers. The absence of the opposition making the remain case has left a gaping democratic deficit.Could Corbyn pivot at this point? Easily, say shadow cabinet remainers, because there is no chance for a Labour-negotiated Brexit now: the only place to be is strongly pro-Europe. Labour members and voters are tearing their hair out at the party’s empty chair as the nation’s fate is decided by a handful of Tories.If Johnson and Farage did make a pact, then in this Brexit crisis Labour must ally with Greens, Lib Dems and independents, promising electoral reform so it never need be done again.

The country will never have needed Labour more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e7eae8d94749240a25bf5d8e6d8628c746fa31/0_0_5569_3339/master/5569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a887c162d51cb2a643d985c2c42154","title":"wahaca workers waiter employers","story":"A row recently erupted over workers’ conditions in the restaurant group Wahaca that turned out to be a little more complicated than it looked. Some diners had done a runner another, law-abiding punter, Sarah Hayward, overheard the ensuing row and took to Twitter to complain: “Ppl next to us left without paying and their server is made to foot the bill from his wages. Apparently company policy. Utterly shameful employment practice.”After some social media to-ing and fro-ing, it turned out the server had been docked £3 on the £40 bill, then reimbursed as it did not amount to “gross negligence”. The company’s founder, Thomasina Miers, concluded: “It is a crazy world where one is hung before even being asked a question … it really saddens me that people are so quick to presume the worst.”It is a bruising experience to be monstered on Twitter and most people who saw the fight kick off will not hang around to watch its resolution. That’s half the point of the site, the social media director of a fashion brand once explained to me, people buy your stuff on Instagram, talk about it on Facebook and complain on Twitter.Wahaca’s policy, though, is muddy. The staff handbook states: “If through your negligence a customer leaves the restaurant without paying you will be liable to pay the full bill including service to the company or it will be deducted from your wages.” It’s hard to imagine what negligence could possibly make it the waiter’s fault that a customer commits an act of theft. Might they collude with the diner in a complicated scam, someone suggested? Hard to see the profit of such an enterprise when someone other than the waiter has already eaten it.But the killer detail is “including service” if someone steals a sum from this restaurant that includes an amount specifically meant for the waiter, the waiter still has to reimburse the restaurant. There is no decent response to that beyond: “You what?”It is impossible to imagine such a policy – which is by no means confined to Wahaca – surviving a robust and equitable negotiation between employer and employee.Odd details about workplaces frequently fire up the bystander’s imagination. When an Amazon employee has to wear a tag to monitor their pace, or an AA call centre (going back 15 years) times its workers’ loo breaks, there is this collective, audible unease about what it means. You can see any number of statistics about the ision of profit between capital and labour, you can familiarise yourself very well with the extent and reality of the zero-hours contract, but nothing reaches that particular bit of your brain circuitry – let’s call it the perception of justice – quite like a simple, even mundane, human interaction in which one side holds all the cards. Whether it’s hyper-surveillance in the workplace or financial penalties for circumstances beyond your control, these measures speak of a relationship in which the parties are not equal.We’re right to feel disquieted. The presumption of parity – the worker’s time being of comparable value to the employer’s pay, and their voices and interests being, if not always perfectly aligned, at least of equal importance – is the fundamental principle of dignity at work. This is what unions established and everything that makes gainful employment bearable – from weekends to sick pay – spiralled from it. Whenever we hear a story of the workplace that doesn’t sound fair, the thought should end: “That person should join a union.”Some years ago, Neil Foster, now at the GMB and one of the most inspiring thinkers of the modern trade union movement, had an idea to reinvigorate it. All the large sectoral unions were seeing declining numbers and low engagement but more to the point, the rise of insecurity at work was having a corrosive effect on union influence. Employees who didn’t know how many shifts they would get from one week to the next simply couldn’t afford the jeopardy of picking a fight.Foster’s idea was a broad-based online union not limited to any particular sector, which anyone could join. It would have the institutional knowledge and skills of a traditional union, but the ease of use and prospect of mass mobilisation you find in modern online campaigning organisations like Avaaz and 38 Degrees. Collective demands could be made that didn’t hang on inidual workers whose positions were precarious.While that has yet to happen, there is significant creativity in this field: university lecturers have started pop-up unions to fight on single issues. Unite set up a community union for the unemployed and low-paid to fight the bedroom tax. The GMB, defending three groundsmen who were fired from Brighton football club this month, had a surge of solidarity support.Today everyone from Marxists to Rory Stewart seems broadly to agree that a new world is struggling to be born. These spontaneous explosions at injustice on Twitter suggest something a little more specific and practical is waiting to find its voice: a mass movement, similar in scope and ambition to the earliest days of unionisation, with the wholly new tools of the connected workforce. Online outrage is edging towards online solidarity. Less an echo chamber, more a muster point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f0be65fe35000ab78af4d3500f0ff2337e10604/0_178_3296_1977/master/3296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d89ab3b248a780ea8aea46e320db4f9","title":"why is it so hard for labour to find a woman for its inner circle","story":"The Tory leadership is just men talking among themselves, and the opposition has no one to counter itOn Sunday night, I may have watched some men in suits talking nonsense. I may have been in the pub. I may have fallen asleep because the Tory-leadership candidate who is actually going to win couldn’t be arsed to turn up. Such is power. Some of these guys aren’t recognisable to me. Such is politics.The winner will stand against Jeremy Corbyn. We all know Corbyn is very concerned about having more women in the Labour leadership. But not concerned enough to actually have many. Emily Thornberry couldn’t be called on to do PMQs as she made the terrible faux pas of telling the truth about the European elections. In the US, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden feel entitled enough to lead despite all the great Democrat women who are running against them.For the past few years, in every chat I have had with a senior Labour person, they have acknowledged that the party needs a female leader. The Tories have done it twice. Maybe the Lib Dems will appoint Jo Swinson. But Labour has a shortage of women, not on its benches but in its inner circle. This inner circle includes the same people who struggle to deal effectively with sexual harassment cases and antisemitism, so it’s understandable they would find it challenging to track down a woman – any woman! – with the intellectual depth and mental agility of the present leader.We keep being told politics is broken, and that we are entering the era of a multi-party system. Brexit represents the great ide, while the climate emergency overshadows everything. As always, there is something more important in the air for Labour than gender representation. Strong voices, from Stella Creasy to Jess Phillips, are not loyal enough to a leader who himself was never loyal. A suitable female pet has to be groomed or the revolution may stall.Or it has already. When there is a general election involving a Tory leader who has treated the women in his life abominably, it would be progress at least if he could be challenged by a woman.But I know that’s a silly dream."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b54abb9eb619bc4ff996fd430db09f4f383f142/317_82_2682_1609/master/2682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e01b41ea3054d52f9ab740f8955c934","title":"gloria vanderbilt farewell fashions innovative heiress","story":"The model-turned-designer established a $100m empire that began with her signature jeans. But her personality was key to crafting that fortuneGloria Vanderbilt first ventured into the fashion world as a model. She was photographed by top names including Richard Avedon and Horst P Horst and appeared in Vogue as well as Harper’s Bazaar. It wasn’t until the 1970s, when Vanderbilt was in her 50s, that she established her design credentials, becoming an early pioneer of stretch jeans.Vanderbilt worked with manufacturer Mohan Murjani to popularise jeans for women at a time when they were largely designed for men. She was among the first to use a famous family name in the marketing of a fashion line, emblazoning her signature across the back pocket of the famously fitted designs. The Amanda jeans which – as she put it – “really hug your derrière” cemented her place in fashion history, and proved innovative enough to spark a $100m (£79m) empire.“The marketing of Gloria Vanderbilt jeans is one of the most dramatic American business success stories of the decade,” reported the New York Times in 1979. Yet her style legacy goes beyond the clothes she designed: as an heiress and socialite, Vanderbilt regularly featured in best-dressed lists. She expanded her product line to include other logoed items, as well as perfumes, sheets, shoes and accessories. Meanwhile, her friend Truman Capote is said to have based the character of Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany’s on her. The novella was famously made into a film starring another fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn.Vanderbilt was admired by others within the industry, with fellow designer Roy Halston Frowick, AKA Halston, remarking that she had “become a professional in the most difficult, cutthroat business there is, and I say, ‘good show’.” Designer Diane von Fürstenberg, best known for popularising the wrap dress, also noted that Vanderbilt “tried to do many, many things for many, many years. The thing that you least associated her with – jeans – worked.”Like Lee Radziwill, who also died earlier this year, Vanderbilt might also be described as “the original influencer”, often appearing in person to promote the products bearing her name. From 1978 to 1984, she was reported to have earned more than $17m. However, by the time the Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corporation was sold to the Jones Apparel Group in 2002 for $100m, she had withdrawn all interest in the company.“I’m not knocking inherited money,” she told the New York Times in 1985, “but the money I’ve made has a reality to me that inherited money doesn’t have.”In a world where the denim industry has become king and worth an estimated £71bn, Vanderbilt’s passing will rightfully reflect on – and celebrate – the legacy she leaves behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf013e602a9c948575c7dfa5c35ec2cd718daa5e/0_741_3487_2093/master/3487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2064e4d8ed934c404047d3ff95cce72","title":"gloria vanderbilt a life in pictures","story":"Known as ‘the poor little rich girl’, she survived family tragedy and a sensational court case to become an actor, designer and fashion icon.

The former England midfielder is understood to be keen on the job and the Premier League side are expected to make a formal approach this week.Derby, who have enjoyed a healthy relationship with Chelsea in recent times, remain publicly bullish over their chances of retaining their manager for the foreseeable future after Lampard led them to the Championship play-off final last season.“There is no change except that Chelsea no longer have a manager,” the chairman, Mel Morris, told TalkSport. “Of course, we have made it very clear to everyone, but most importantly to Frank, that we want to retain Frank for the long-term.“If Chelsea want to hire Frank, then it is in their gift to make an offer in pursuit of that. In the meantime we will continue to put our best foot forward to continue with our plans for the coming season and work with Frank for him to know how much he is wanted by everyone associated with the club.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88ac0086f65d59a4838ba50b19b11bb7cc430ffe/9_82_2171_1302/master/2171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39b51f7bd5f66439be55cd5deaee1b13","title":"south africa germany womens world cup match report","story":"Germany sealed top spot in Group B as they eased past South Africa with a 4-0 Women’s World Cup victory in Montpellier on Monday.Following 1-0 wins in their opening two matches against China and Spain, the reigning Olympic champions progressed to the last 16 in style while their opponents were sent home after three defeats.Melanie Leupolz put Germany in front after 14 minutes with a free header from close range.

Nnadozie has been shown to have moved before the penalty was taken and missed. Oh, that’s harsh. Two goals in their first game, an own-goal in the next game, and now a dreadfully casual penalty. She hit the post. And all while Le Sommer was on the field...Another Renard header drifts over for France, but an infringement goes against her...what’s this? France want a penalty and VAR is in session. Asseyi is baulked by Ebere. The ref missed it, but now she gets a look at the screen. As the last manwoman, Ebere has to receive a second yellow.Roger Wallace emails in: “I’ve been following your world cup coverage and just had a thought: in the (admittedly unlikely) scenario in which Nigeria not only continue to hold off France but actually score one on them, how would the group winner be decided, as Norway and France would be even on points and GD? Obviously away goals is not a thing.”From wiki: Much of South Korea’s life seems to have drained from them. A Norway goal looks more likely but they have just missed a big chance through Saevik, on as a substitute. France subs: Cascarino off for Le Sommer and Gauvin off for Diani. With Nigeria pinned back and needing to score five goals, it looks as if Norway are dead set for second place in Group A. What a miss from France! Cascarino gets down the right-hand side, and her vision allows her to find Thiney in open space. The finish is poor, with the shot drifting well wide of the post. Wasteful again. Over in Rennes, France continue to mount pressure without looking capable of scoring. They seem to lose the run of themselves once the goal nears.And meanwhile, Graham Hansen will not be risked any further. She looks in some pain and there look to be tears in her eyes. Norway’s injury list is piling up. Graham Hansen can’t take the penalty herself, as she is getting her sore ankle iced off the field. Up steps Herlovsen to take and she hits it low. The goalkeeper gets two hands to it, but the ball squeaks into the back of the net. Korea’s World Cup looks to be over. Graham Hansen is fouled by Kang and that looks a plum penalty. Peter Campbell emails in: “In the replays I saw, I didn’t see any contact between Gauvin’s foot and the Nigeria player’s face. Did you see any contact? If not, the defender seemed to have sold the ref on the card and I wonder whether VAR would get involved in such decisions?”It did look a harsh yellow, but I wonder whether yellow cards can be overturned. A high kick is still dangerous play even if it doesn’t count. Three teams here don’t mind matters finishing as you were, while it is South Korea who need things to change. They have 45 minutes to save themselves. France almost begin their second half with another Renard goal, but this time her header is wide. The hosts have gone at it from the whistle. That early penalty separates the teams, but it is Korea, who need a win and for other results to go their way, who have been the team in the ascendancy. France have been unconvincing, it has to be said.France’s Valerie Gauvin is booked for a high kick when trying to get perform an overhead in the Nigerian box. The crowd boo that one, but it was a little wild. Korea’s Ji has another sighter for a free-kick, and again, it’s over the bar. A clash of knees between Chikwelu and Bibault, with both players high in the challenge, but both will be OK to carry on. A drop-ball is awarded as neither was worse than the other. Oof, close for France! Cascarino wins the ball in midfield, surges on, and then whips a pass into the box. Gauvin, who had to improvise, got her heel to the ball but not on target.  China and Spain both made it through after a game the Spanish might have won.Oof, nasty clash of head in Reims where Norway keeper Hjelmseth took out teammate Mjelde when reaching for one of those high Nigerian balls. Thankfully, after a bit of treatment, Mjelde is OK to carry on. Justin Kavanagh emails in: “The game is Rennes is a fine clash of couture between the African chic arrowheads and neon green shirts of the Nigerian strip and the classic French unadorned navy elegance of Les Bleus. BTW Neither Delphine (nor her twin sister Estelle—also a player) Cascarino are related to Tony Cascarino, despite being born at the time when the Ice Cream Man (as forgetful Jack Charlton used to call him) was a player in France.”When ‘Cas’ used to play for Gillingham, I used to think it highly exotic that they had an Italian playing in the Third Division. When Marseille flopped after their corruption scandal, it was Cas replacing Jean-Pierre Papin and the like. France have not been too impressive here, but their corner count is mounting. Okeke has been the pick of Nigeria’s defenders on these set pieces and gets the ball clear. Sadly, Nigeria’s chance of a break fails after a poor cross to the back post. Yet another Korean corner after Ji, of Chelsea, forces some evasive action from the Norwegians, who have been weathering the storm. The ball makes its way to Moon, the striker, but her shot is seemingly aimed at her namesake and flies way over the bar. Yellow card for Nigeria after Ebere is booked for a foul on Cascarino. Yet more pressure from the Koreans, who force another corner. Yet again, it comes to little. Nice flipped ball by France’s Bibault just evades Thiney. The French really pushing for the win that would give them maximum points. And with those rotations, some will be looking to impress manager Corinne Diacre for the latter stages.South Korea win a free-kick in a decent position, but Ji’s somewhat weak attempt - straight into the wall - was a waste. Norway under some pressure but the Koreans yet to find the last pass or shot to get back into the game. Germany cruised through to the next round and looked menacing in one of today’s earlier games. Another chance for France as Henry makes the time and space to flash in a shot. It goes wide. Lovely skill to make the chance, less so the finish. They have been..excitable in front of goal. Yes, a Norway chance soon comes on the counter, and Herlovsen looked likely to score, only for a decent save from the foot of Nnadozie in the Nigerian goal. Gauvin flashes a header over for France. They have created plenty of chances this tournament, but are blowing far too many of them. The Koreans are playing for their lives here, keeping up the pressure though are in danger of leaving too much space at the back. France are making heavier weather of the first ten minutes, but the momentum is with them. Cascarino forces a corner, their second of the match. Renard is the target after those two goals in the opening match, but this time the ball goes back to Asseyi, who fails to get much purchase on her shot. Norway are chasing another in quick succession, forcing another corner. Thorisdottir comes up for it again, having been manhandled for the penalty. It reaches Mjelde this time but she heads over. As it stands, Norway will take second in the group, and the French will top the group. Four points should be enough for the Nigerians to go through in third, too. Hansen steps up and slots home, but only just. That’s the earliest penalty in tournament history, and the earliest goal of this tournament. A mountain to climb for the Koreans. From a corner, Thorisdottir is fouled in the box, the ref has no hestitation in awarding it. As might be expected in Rennes, France begin on the front foot, with plenty of noise behind them, too. Nigeria, though, force an early corner. They take their time over it, and the French goalkeeper, Bouhhadi, flaps at it.With only France assured of their destiny, and even then not quite sure of winning their group, there is plenty to play for.All four teams are in the tunnel and it has to be said that the Nigerians’ sing-song entry to the stadium took the eye. It’s very loud in Rennes, perhaps a bit less so in Reims but that’s always the way when the hosts are playing. The Marseillaise is pretty damned loud. Those teams from Reims in more readable fashion. South Korea: Kim, Lee, Shin, Kim, Jang, Kang, Ji, Cho, Lee, Yeo, MoonAs expected and predicted, France have shuffled the pack, with four changes, including leading striker Eugenie le Sommer dropping to the bench along with Marion Torrent, Kadidiatou Diani and Elise Bussaglia. Eve Perisset, Charlotte Bilbault, Delphine Cascarino and Viviane Asseyi come in. Nigeria have made just one change, and that’s midfielder Halimatu Ayinde, replacing Chinaza Uchendu.The Nigeria v France team news in more readable fashion. Nigeria (4-3-3): Nnadozie, Okeke, Ohale, Ebi, Ebere, Ayinde, Okobi, Chikwelu, Ordega, Oparanozie, OshoalaAnd the teams for Nigeria v France.Here’s the teams for South Korea v Norway. And for the match in Rennes.While we wait for the teams, here’s the team guides for tonight’s match in Reims. After Group B went first, it’s Group A’s turn to face the final curtain. With the hosts France already through, their task is gain a draw from Nigeria in Rennes to make sure they top the group and that they face one of the third-placed teams in the last 16. Nigeria are third in the group, and having lost to Norway last time out, need a result to force themselves into that third-place picture, with their goal difference being three goals inferior to the Norwegians, who must be expected to beat South Korea in Reims. The runners-up play the second-placed team in Group C, which looks likely to be Brazil. A draw would probably be good enough for both Nigeria and Norway. They could even lose and go through. Confused? You probably will be. It’s times like this that are an argument for a 32-team (or even 16) tournament. What we do know is that only a win will be good enough for the Koreans. It might be expected that Corinne Diacre, the France manager, might make some rotations for tonight. The hosts have looked decent so far and have caught the public’s imagination. Kick-offs, 8pm UK time.

Speaking from his home in Kumbakonam, with his wife, Menaka and daughter, Aniya, who turned seven last week, Ayyappan said: “I cannot describe what it felt like to hold my daughter again after so many days and nights. I’m really happy. She is also very happy.”He last saw Aniya when she was four years old.It marks the end of a long, drawn-out case where the captain and crew were abandoned by the vessel owner, Elite Way Marine Services, unable to leave the ship fearing the loss of their claim to thousands of dollars in unpaid wages.Ayyappan sent the  a video that recorded the emotional moment he finally left his ship, MV Azraqmoiah, shot from a speedboat carrying him safely to shore. “When I touched land, I felt like flying – oh my God,” said the merchant seaman of 20 years. “This is the day we dreamed of. My cup is overflowing again and again.”The seafarers endured terrible hardship aboard, as their supplies dwindled and finally ran out, prompting them to seek help to survive. Ali’s father passed away in August 2018, yet still they waited for the wages. There were days when a lack of fuel left the vessel in darkness in the busy shipping lane, endangering the crew and other ships. The Indian consulate and the charity Mission to Seafarers were able to help by providing food and water.In all, 36 sailors in at least seven vessels were abandoned by Elite Way Marine Services, according to the Federal Transport Authority (FTA) in the UAE. The case was first highlighted by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF). UAE-owned Elite Way Marine Services told the  in April that they failed to pay the seafarers from Azraqmoiah and other ships after encountering financial problems, but promised they would be paid soon. Captain Ibrahim Gafar, Elite Way’s operations manager, said the company had previously been unwilling to sell any of its vessels to release money for wage payments because unfavourable market conditions meant he would not get a good price, but they later found a buyer for one while another was being sold for scrap. “We have a financial problem,” said Gafar at the time. “For one and a half years the market has been down. Any person would not give a good price for the vessel.”The company could not be contacted for this article.It has since emerged that the international attention brought by the ’s coverage in April and May helped to pressurise the owners to act.In February, Mission to Seafarers and the FTA took legal action against the vessel’s owner over the unpaid salaries. The first ship was arrested under maritime law in April, followed by other vessels, including the Azraqmoiah, which was sold to pay the seafarers’ salaries. The FTA has banned the company from operating in UAE waters.Jasamin Fichte, of the law firm Fichte \u0026amp Co, said the vessel’s owner had “made a mockery” of the UAE legal system. She vowed to lobby for better regulations.Fichte said: “It’s obvious to everyone involved the ship owner has to pay their wages. If it hadn’t been for our actions, the crew would not have been paid at all. But the vessel owner got away with paying less. He has made a mockery of the legal system here.”The conditions on the ship were “horrible”, she added.“Such actions would be considered criminal in many jurisdictions. Seafarers were suffering from physical and psychological conditions. We were worried for their safety. No food, no water, no air conditioning in 40 degree heat – it’s not something I would wish on anybody.”Fichte said she will meet with the UAE government to talk about how they can stop the rising problem of vessel owners abandoning crew in their waters. A law to seize abandoned ships is already under discussion in the country.Rev Andy Bowerman, the Middle East and south-east Asia director of Mission to Seafarers, praised Ayyappan for helping to highlight the “unacceptable” issue of abandonment at sea.“He realised that if he held out for longer, he would highlight the issue – and there is a bigger issue here,” said Bowerman. “At some point the UAE has got to change its approach to seafarers.”He urged the UAE to sign up to an amendment to the maritime labour convention, which guarantees better protection for seafarers by requiring ships to carry insurance to pay them if they are abandoned.Worldwide, 4,866 seafarers on a total of 336 vessels have been abandoned on board ship since 2004, according to a database by the International Maritime Organization and the International Labour Organization.“The flag states should do more,” said Mohamed Arracedi, the ITF’s coordinator for the Arab world and Iran, who has dealt with over 100 cases of abandonment and recovered $1.26m in owed wages in 2018. “Many of the cases we are dealing with in the Emirates are severe abandonment cases.

It did not dispute the government’s claim that its investors had close ties to the Saudi state, but said it remained editorially independent. It said there was no justification for the government to investigate the deals, and claimed such action could harm its financial future.A spokesperson said: “We have explained why there is no proper legal basis for an investigation into these transactions, which we believe would be counterproductive and detrimental to the health and stability of the UK media landscape.“We have nothing to fear from an investigation, but regard it as an unnecessary and expensive distraction, which could have a devastating effect on any future investment needed for the wider industry’s sustainability and growth.“Our media outlets are firmly committed to the accurate presentation of news and freedom of expression. Our editorial record speaks for itself. We uphold these values proudly, reflecting the trust the public places in us. We know that this trust is important – and all the more so in the current political climate. Our editorial policies, guidelines and reporting reflect these standards, as we have again reiterated to the secretary of state today. We have no further comment to make at this point.”The government will make a final decision on whether to a launch a full investigation into the Saudi investment by the end of the month.The dire financial state of the UK media industry has raised concerns that prestigious British news brands could be influenced by the availability of money from overseas, especially from Gulf states involved in a Middle Eastern proxy war, spending millions on lobbyists and soft power campaigns.Last year Lebedev accompanied an Evening Standard reporter on a tour of war-torn Yemen along with Saudi-backed troops, posing for pictures on his personal Instagram account.The Independent has already launched a series of foreign-language sites using its brand, which are controlled and operated by Saudi Arabian journalists and aimed at readers in the Middle East.Saudi Arabia has a historically poor record for journalism and freedom of speech. It was ranked 169th out of 180 countries in the 2018 World Press Freedom Index, while last year the Saudi government was implicated in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its own consulate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc7e03b68490df6acc8422afad6249dd1969201/50_554_4280_2569/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=785922addb24b9493cc05c267ea3c567","title":"private armies secret deals russia putin drive into africa","story":"A cache of leaked documents appear to show how a close Putin ally is leading a push to turn Africa into a strategic hub with echoes of Soviet-era zones of influence.

To some of his rivals, the foreign secretary is a worrying repetition of what has gone before, a managerial politician in an age tending towards populism.They are also unsure what he believes in, citing a deleted tweet by the former Tory peer Andrew Cooper that Hunt’s conversion from remainer to hard Brexiter made him an “unprincipled windsock”. Theresa-in-trousers (Tit) is the nickname given to him by an opposing camp that has proved somewhat sticky.“People see him as too nice. OK at running a department but not the leader we need in these times,” says one Conservative MP who decided to back another candidate after being courted by Hunt. He is essentially a “nice, conscientious and quite polite person … there aren’t two faces of Jeremy Hunt,” says one of his former staffers.People who have worked in his private office are full of stories about him bringing in the coffees each morning and showing interest in their families. He is also devoted to his wife, Lucia, who let slip in a joint interview at the weekend that her nickname for him is “Big Rice”, while he calls her “precious”.Aware that his goodnatured reputation could be seen as a weakness, his campaign has presented him as a tough negotiator who has the business experience to see the country through Brexit and the compassion to unite it afterwards. Supportive MPs and his former business partner appear in his launch video to stress that politeness doesn’t mean he lacks steel.Examples Hunt cites include his oversight of the Olympics as culture secretary, setting up Yemen peace talks as foreign secretary and his decision to impose a contract on junior doctors while health secretary.The medics who went on strike over the contract have nothing but bitter memories about what they saw as his insulting suggestion that the NHS was not a “seven-day” service. Dr Rachel Clarke, one of the leading campaigners against the contract, poured scorn on the idea that the dispute could ever be considered a successful negotiation.She criticises him for failing to try to understand his negotiating partners and raising the stakes when he should have been trying to lower them.“If Mr Hunt seriously sees that as a triumph, as evidence of his superior negotiating skills, then he is stone deaf as well as dumb. He may have ‘won’ the battle, to borrow his aggressive language, but the bigger picture, the war, was lost. He broke an entire doctor workforce. The scars from that dispute will take a generation to heal,” she says.Those who have worked closely with Hunt over the years say he enforced the junior doctors’ contract because he genuinely believed it would benefit patients, having decided improving safety would be his priority as health secretary.His leadership bid has gained endorsements from two high-profile safety campaigners, James Titcombe, who lost his son and says Hunt treated him as a “grieving dad rather than a troublemaker”, and Deb Hazeldine, who lost her mother and says Hunt “saw the bereaved daughter behind the campaigner”.Sue Beeby, who is job-sharing as Hunt’s director of campaigns and started working with him 12 years ago, said his modus operandi is to focus on one or two priorities that he commits to delivering. She believes he would take this approach into No 10, along with a temperament that is “incredibly positive and so upbeat and so optimistic that actually it helps the team to gather round him and think you can do it”.His corporate attitude to delivery is the thread running through his career, from founder of the multimillion-pound publishing business Hotcourses to the type of cabinet minister who likes to cite Black Box Thinking, a guide to becoming more successful by his friend Matthew Syed.Numerous people who worked with him in the Department of Health recall Monday morning meetings where progress toward his goals was examined in a “command and control” strategy. Some believe Hunt came close to exceeding the boundaries of his role by interfering in the day-to-day running of the NHS and that he was too obsessed by media headlines.“Everyone felt obliged to go to these meetings and it felt like they were verging on being too political about the NHS. It was Hunt’s way of controlling things even though some people were thinking he maybe shouldn’t be doing that,” says one former Whitehall staffer who now works in the health sector.His aides from the time say it was essential to keep on top of a mammoth department where things could easily go wrong and become a crisis plastered over every front page. They also point to his political success in having avoided health becoming an even bigger election issue for the Conservatives and the negotiation to get a five-year NHS funding settlement.Defending him against the charge of being insufficiently ruthless, his supporters say he should be viewed as a survivor, who has lasted nine years in cabinet throughout both David Cameron and Theresa May’s tenures.When May tried to get rid of him during an NHS winter crisis in 2018, he refused to be moved to business secretary and somehow ended up emerging from the meeting with an expanded portfolio covering social care as well.He also managed to weather a grade-A political storm as culture secretary during the Leveson inquiry, when his contact with the Murdoch media empire came under scrutiny. Hunt had a quasi-judicial role in overseeing takeover of BSkyB by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.In the end, it was a close adviser, Adam Smith, who fell on his sword. Smith, who had been in contact with a News Corp lobbyist, later gave evidence that Hunt had initially supported him but changed his mind the next day, saying everyone “thinks you should go”.Rob Wilson, the former Tory MP who was Hunt’s parliamentary private secretary, says he remained calm even when under the extraordinary pressure of newspapers and the opposition calling for him to be fired.“If our backbenchers had gone against him, he would have been out of a job that day but he was completely in control and well prepared and he just kept level-headed and even-tempered about it all,” he says. “On another occasion we were off to the Leveson inquiry and the car was surrounded by paparazzi slamming into us taking pictures but he was just coolness personified.”Coolness is not the impression given by an anecdote about Hunt told by the journalist Iain Martin, who once discovered him hiding behind a tree to avoid media reporters seeing him go into a dinner with News Corp’s James Murdoch in 2010.Wilson says he “definitely saw a difference before and after Leveson” in Hunt, as “going through the fire” of a big political furore made him a better politician, enabling him to climb the ranks of the cabinet.Some of those who worked with Hunt longer ago certainly express surprise that he has made it so far in government. Luke Turner, an author who worked at Hotcourses for three years and coined the description of him as an “affable lummox”, says no one could have guessed then that he would end up as an MP, let alone not far from No 10.Other alumni of Hotcourses, a company that has reputedly made Hunt the richest member of the cabinet, say they scoffed at his recent claim to have gone through a “daily grind to stay alive” when starting his own business, as they only knew him as a decidedly well-to-do son of an admiral and former head boy of Charterhouse.Friends say Hunt has found the best fit of his career so far at the Foreign Office, as a keen traveller who has spent periods of his life fascinated with different parts of the world, including Japan and Brazil. He has also taken advantage of the role to cosy up to serious global players, including Henry Kissinger and Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.He has not been free of embarrassment in that job, wrongly telling Slovenia it had been a “vassal state of the Soviet Union” and accidentally saying his wife was Japanese rather than Chinese. His short stint in the job appears to have been flattered by the gaffe-strewn tenure of his predecessor, Johnson, and he has impressed colleagues with his natural diplomacy.MPs convinced by Hunt believe he is at heart one of the “sensibles”, with a good chance of securing a Brexit deal while avoiding what he has termed the political suicide of no deal. He is now in second place with 43 endorsements, but his team still have a way to go before a place on the shortlist alongside Johnson is guaranteed. Biographical details: Born in Surrey, Hunt was head boy at the £39,000-a-year Charterhouse boarding school before studying PPE at Oxford University.Career trajectory: After Oxford, Hunt worked in consulting and spent two years teaching English in Japan. He went on to establish a PR firm, adirectory publishing business and a charity for Aids orphans in Africa. He was elected MP for South West Surrey in May 2005, and joined the cabinet as culture secretary in 2010. He was appointed health secretary in 2012 and replaced Boris Johnson as foreign secretary in 2018.High point: Outlasting the NHS founder, Aneurin Bevan, to become the longest serving health secretary. His time in office was marked by a long battle with junior doctors, widespread cuts and parliamentary backlash over misleading pledges on NHS funding, making his longevity all the more remarkable.Low point: Confusing his own wife’s nationality. During an official visit to Beijing in his first month as foreign secretary, Hunt incorrectly described his Chinese wife as Japanese. The gaffe came shortly after he had been criticised for failing to declare business interests in his purchase of seven luxury apartments on the south coast of England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6198b68b54e708c7cde12fdfc45bfedb34de07d4/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2685db86c99cb457b47ebdbe5affecb9","title":"stella creasy mps standards authority does not recognise maternity leave","story":"Expectant Labour MP reveals previous miscarriages and says she is forced to ‘choose between being a mum and MP’The Labour MP Stella Creasy has said she feels parliament is telling her to “choose between being a mum and being an MP”, revealing that the parliamentary standards authority has told expectant mothers it does not recognise any form of maternity leave and will not automatically provide extra support for constituency work after she gives birth.Writing in the , Creasy said she had decided to speak out after experiencing two miscarriages during which she was forced to continue to work as normal without any additional support.Now pregnant again, she said she had been told that MPs would not be provided with any additional funding for support staff by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to allow her to get extra help with constituency work.The MP for Walthamstow said she had been heartened by the introduction of proxy voting, introduced earlier this year after a the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who heavily pregnant, was forced to delay her caesarean section and vote in a wheelchair, but that far more had to change.Creasy said that during her first miscarriage, she had carried on constituency work “aching and bleeding”, including joining a protest for the extradition of a man who had raped and murdered a constituent. After her second miscarriage she said she had to arrange the medical procedure around constituency advice surgeries.“Heartbroken by all the years that I have struggled with fertility, I’ve kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected,” she writes. “Now I’m pregnant once more and terrified – not just that it will go wrong again, but because I know that my resolve to keep my private and professional lives separate has become impossible.”Creasy said she had approached Ipsa about funding for cover but was told it “does not ‘recognise’ that MPs go on maternity leave”.“Humiliatingly, it is making me beg for extra staff funding – or give up any chance of spending time with my child to make sure my constituents don’t miss out,” she writes. “If a GP or vicar were on leave, a locum would be provided to ensure continuity of services. In Denmark, a member of the national parliament would have a substitute MP appointed.”Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, told the  she had been refused extra help with her first pregnancy, a year after she arrived in parliament in 2015. Having given birth to her second child four months ago, she said she had not even bothered to make the application.“That is because of the negative reaction I had first time around. They were utterly baffled I was even having a baby, I was passed around and I was told ‘we have not got a historic policy on that because we have not had many women in parliament who give birth’,” she said.“It was painting a picture that MPs could only be men or older women. I don’t think it was meant to be malicious. I think it was genuinely something that had not been dealt with, but it is the most normal thing in the world, having a baby.”Siddiq said she had carried on doing her constituency emails from her hospital bed, but had been supported in constituency events by Keir Starmer, whose constituency neighbours hers.“He helped because we unofficially paired up, but that was the goodness of his heart. If you share a borough with an opposition MP, they wouldn’t do it,” she said.She has continued doing advice surgeries and meetings straight after giving birth, but said proxy voting had vastly improved her experience after the birth of her son.“It has made such a huge difference, not just to my mental health but my physical health, not having to travel to parliament for very late night votes,” she said.Creasy said the struggle MPs experienced trying to take adequate maternity leave was one of many issues where fertility was still a barrier to equality, highlighting non-disclosure agreements used to cover up maternity discrimination and the postcode lottery of fertility treatments. ”Prejudices and unhelpful tropes about motherhood suffocate female representatives – whether we have children or not – in a way that is rarely true for our male counterparts,” she said.“For my work on abortion rights I have been trolled relentlessly with the charge that it is my own childlessness that drives my ‘desire to kill other people’s babies’.”Creasy said she had decided it was “time to stop asking nicely for the discrimination to be dealt with” but said she had found herself on the receiving end of a “bitter reminder that it’s still often men who will make the choices that determine if that battle will be won”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47be42670fb1780d8663dcb408934f017b55e3df/0_289_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79f79ca6a7845919081b67b87785e472","title":"teens county lines gangs","story":"My team works with young people who’ve been groomed, brainwashed and traumatised. We help them rebuild their lives “Somebody being shot in front of you, or you yourself shooting somebody, became just like drinking a glass of water.” An interview with a child soldier from Sierra Leone I read recently really struck a chord with me, because it’s the same sort of impact I see working with young people caught up in county lines. Exploitation normalises violence. Young lives are scarred.County lines describes when gangs from cities expand drug networks to other areas of the country, typically using dedicated mobile phone lines to supply drugs.I manage a team of young persons substance misuse workers and am an experienced safeguarding lead. My team work alongside schools, social workers, mental health services and the police to support young people exploited through county lines. I’ve worked in the drug and alcohol sector for 20 years. No one gets into this kind of work because it’s easy, and I’ve had my fair share of ups and downs, but I’ve never experienced anything quite like this it traumatises the young people involved.Operations in major cities seek new markets outside urban hubs for their drugs, primarily crack cocaine and heroin. The expansion of their networks into the regions often comes with exploitation.Children and vulnerable adults are often coerced into ferrying and stashing the drugs. They can be homeless or missing people, addicts, people living in care, trapped in poverty, or suffering from mental illness or learning difficulties.\u0026nbspEven older and physically infirm people have been targeted and officers have observed a gang member attending drug rehab to find potential runners.\u0026nbspInitially they can be lured in with money, gifts and the prospect of status. But this can quickly turn into the use of violence, sometimes sexual.Children without criminal records - known in the trade as clean skins - are preferred because they are less likely to be known to detectives.\u0026nbspCharity The Children\u0027s Society says 4,000 teenagers in London alone are exploited through county lines.\u0026nbspThe Children\u0027s Commissioner estimates at least 46,000 children in England are caught up in gangs.Google “county lines” and you’ll see endless news stories about arrests and drug seizures. While it’s important the adults involved are brought to justice, the message that the “war on county lines” is being won misses the bigger picture. It’s more than just a criminal issue. Behind the headlines adults are exploiting children on a mass scale. It’s too easy to forget that we’re talking about kids: it’s child abuse, and the language we use needs to reflect this.My team is working with a group of boys in their early teens who were groomed into joining a county lines gang. People assume they must be from broken homes but many have had very normal childhoods in the countryside.The boys were hanging out at a skatepark when a man asked if they wanted to have a smoke in his flat and play computer games. He later introduced them to other men who gave them free cannabis, takeaway food, trainers, tracksuits and hoodies. It was as though Christmas had come early. After around six months, the men started to ask them for favours, such as dropping off packages at certain addresses.Eventually, the young people were given a substantial amount of cannabis and told to sell it to other teens. The men took advantage of them by showing them a life of luxury they’d never seen before. They were promised the best clothes and cars, but, above all, that people would respect them. These boys were only 13 years old.To achieve this dream, they were told they had to start selling class A substances such as crack and heroin. The men brainwashed them that the vulnerable people who use these drugs weren’t human because “they are ruining your town and don’t deserve any respect”.Young people have told my team how they’ve committed horrific acts of violence against these people, who are members of the community they grew up in. Taken out of context, you would think these teenagers were monsters. But it is important to realise the extent to which they’ve been coerced and desensitised to the feelings of others. Like a child soldier, they’ve seen things a child should never see.When young people feel vulnerable they look to adults who they trust for support. But the men who promised them the world turn their backs on them when the authorities get involved. Services like mine pick up the pieces, offering them the emotional connection they need to rebuild that sense of trust and belonging.Recently one young person asked his key worker what they used to do when they were 16. My colleague described a normal teenage life of going to college, socialising with friends and making a fool of themselves at parties. The young person was shocked, admitting he’d only been to a party once when he was allowed to “knock off early” as he’d shifted all his “gear”.These children are often excluded from school and miss the milestones most of us take for granted. They have never experienced the nerves of the first day in college, the joy of finishing exams or the freedom of independence.Research by the Children’s Society found young people who are criminally exploited frequently experience emotional and psychological trauma, often due to violence they’ve seen and been forced to commit. It’s therefore no wonder that many of the young people my team work with are showing signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. One boy who’s soon to turn 18 said: “I can’t be around normal people because if they say the wrong thing I may end up in a fight. I’m not like other people.”As they get older, many of the young people exploited though county lines will become involved with the criminal justice system. Once they slip into adulthood, this can often mean prison.But sentencing someone brands them a criminal it’s the ultimate judgment, blaming them rather than the adults pulling the strings. That’s why in the service I run we’ve banned the term county lines. Instead, we refer to it solely as exploitation. Obviously these young people are involved in crime, but they’re also very much the victims of crime. They need to be listened to without judgment. They need a way back, rather than a locked door.• Sonya Jones is a service manager and safeguarding lead at Young Addaction, which offers advice via www.addaction.org.ukwebchat"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/330503d9d270acbca66f8fedd705e672f3ccc431/134_35_3232_1939/master/3232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfba4cbf3f11562dd80104b62e61a2be","title":"nick kyrgios disrespect top players daniil medvedev","story":"• ‘I probably don’t show them respect – they’re just good at tennis’• Daniil Medvedev says he always wanted Roger Federer to loseNick Kyrgios says he is happy to keep his feud with Novak Djokovic ticking over at Wimbledon next month – while Daniil Medvedev, another of the sport’s young rebels, uttered the ultimate heresy on Monday when he revealed he always wanted Roger Federer to lose.For the first time since 2013, when the Latvian loose cannon Ernests Gulbis accused Federer, Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray of being “boring”, there is insurrection in the air and boredom seems the underlying cause of the latest unrest.Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 20-year-old Greek who is top seed here, is impatient for other young players to challenge harder against the elite. Kyrgios, who has already upset his betters, thinks the stars do have a hold over the next generation – but shouldn’t. “I probably don’t show them respect,” the Australian admitted. “They’re just good at tennis. I just don’t know if the younger guys are good enough to beat them over five sets.”Meanwhile Medvedev, one of the game’s bright hopes, says that growing up in an era when the Big Three have won nearly all the important trophies had never sat well with him.Shortly after dismissing the 35-year-old Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 6-2, 6-4 in 70 minutes on day one of the Fever-Tree championships at the Queen’s Club in west London, the 23-year-old Russian said: “When I was 10, I hated Roger. I just couldn’t see him win again. I was cheering from the first round for other guys, because that’s the way I was. When Barcelona was winning everything in football, I wanted them to lose badly. If I lose first round, I don’t care if it’s Nadal, Roger or Novak who wins the French Open. I’m just upset about myself losing in the first round. That’s how it is.”Kyrgios, who said in a recent podcast that Djokovic’s cup-of-love victory celebrations were “cringeworthy,” was nevertheless happy to laud Nadal for his 12th Roland Garros triumph, adding that Wimbledon, which starts on 1 July, could be a shootout between Djokovic and Federer. “Over five sets I don’t think anyone will ever beat Rafa at the French Open,” Kyrgios said. “It’s just too hard physically. But at Wimbledon it’s going to be tough to beat Novak or Federer, five sets.”Kyrgios, who faces the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino on Tuesday, is not intimidated by anyone. He won all four sets against Djokovic in their only two matches, back-to-back two years ago in Acapulco and Indian Wells, and has promised to imitate his love-to-the-crowd gesture if he beats him again. He said of his fractious relationship with the spiritual Serb, “If I play Novak, he’d just be determined to get one win against me.“I have played Rafa a bunch of times. We have beaten each other, as well. I think they are motivated to beat me in general. I don’t think before those comments they were, like, ‘Oh, I don’t really care.’ They wanted to beat me, regardless. But my opinions won’t change. I don’t mind. When we go out there and we battle, that’s what it is.”Kyrgios had a mixed message for his friend Murray, however, two days before the Scot returns to the game in doubles with Feliciano López: “Just to see him back healthy and seeing him happy on court is all that matters. He’s the first person I saw here on the court, doing doubles drills, and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It’s just good to see him back – but I don’t think I want to carry him for Wimbledon dubs.”Cameron Norrie, one of five British players in the Queen’s draw, found the two-times grand slam finalist, Kevin Anderson, too strong over two hours and 20 minutes and the South African won 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4.Kyle Edmund, Dan Evans and Jay Clarke play on Tuesday. Evans, coming off 10 straight wins and two grass-court titles, plays the three-times major champion Stan Wawrinka for the third time, having taken a set off him in Indian Wells this year and nearly beating him in five high-quality sets in the third round of the US Open three years ago.Johanna Konta impressed in her first match since reaching the French Open semi-finals to ease into the second round of the Nature Valley Classic in Birmingham.The British No 1 made a seamless transition from clay to grass, beating Anett Kontaveit 6-4, 6-2. The Estonian is only ranked two places lower than Konta but the No 7 seed played at a high level throughout and wrapped up victory in an hour and 12 minutes.The only blip came when she dropped serve at 4-3 in the opening set but she re-established her advantage straight away and the second set was particularly impressive, with Konta displaying her more rounded game to great effect.There was disappointment, though, for British No 2 Heather Watson, who let a lead slip in a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 defeat to Barbora Strycova. Watson was unhappy with a number of line calls and declined to shake the umpire’s hand at the end of the match.Russia’s Margarita Gasparyan pulled off an upset in the opening contest of the day, defeating the fourth seed Elina Svitolina 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. Svitolina had been struggling with a knee injury and, despite ending a four-match losing streak by reaching the third round of the French Open, she admitted she may be forced to skip the grass-court season.World No 1 Naomi Osaka will open her campaign on Tuesday with a tricky clash against Greek world No 33 Maria Sakkari, and admitted her expectations are low in her first grass-court tournament of the season.“I’m not really that comfortable with it,” she said. “And it’s always the first tournament that’s the hardest. I have only practised twice on grass because it was raining a lot.” PA"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c418f3d59d3a1e39d07dd0bd007cfd4bd0c1c4f/0_326_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cbc4efbee8a5becf7096bb5c8f2774b","title":"why bookie bashing royal ascot may add to horse racing money misery","story":"There will be quite a few iniduals at Royal Ascot this week for whom £17m is the rough equivalent of the small change that the rest of us put in a pot by the front door for emergencies. Racing as a whole, however, still considers £17m to be quite a lot of money and it also happens to be the size of the dent left in the sport’s finances by the Cheltenham and Aintree Festivals this year.The results at those two meetings were, overall, very good for the punters and therefore very bad for the bookies. At Cheltenham nine of the 28 races went to the favourite, including a six-race sequence on the middle two days when the backers could do no wrong. One of the winners was Tiger Roll, probably the most popular horse in training, who compounded the bookies’ misery three weeks later when he won the Grand National.Bookies pay a percentage of their profits on racing bets back to the sport via a mechanism known as the Levy. If their profits dip, so does the Levy. But even so there was general astonishment last month when it transpired that the 2018-19 Levy scheme had come up £17m short of expectations.The shortfall will translate into cutbacks over the coming months: less prize money, reduced investment, lowered expectations. And while the punters, as ever, will be cheering for the favourites at Flat racing’s showpiece event, those in charge of the sport’s cashflow may be hoping for an upset or two – or even four or five – to ease the pressure.They may well be disappointed because the trainer the punters will be backing above all others is Aidan O’Brien, a dominant force in Flat racing for two decades and someone who seems, if anything, to be tightening his grip year by year.O’Brien is expected to field the favourite in around a third of the meeting’s 30 races, is odds-on to finish the week as the leading trainer and could easily trouble the all-time record of seven winners at a single Royal meeting, which he set in 2016.Ryan Moore, O’Brien’s principal jockey, is around 5-2 to equal his own record of nine winners, set in 2015.Punters will be impatient to get proceedings underway with the first of the O’Brien-trained favourites, Le Brivido, in the Queen Anne Stakes, the first race of the meeting on Tuesday. O’Brien also has the favourite for Wednesday’s feature event, the Prince of Wales’s Stakes, in Magical, while Hermosa and Ten Sovereigns, in the two big races on Friday, will also be paired in countless win doubles, currently paying out at around 5-1.The Gold Cup, the feature event of the meeting, is one of the few when O’Brien does not have the first or second favourite. But Straarius, the 5-4 market leader to win the race for a second year running, is due to be ridden by the other man the bookies fear: Frankie Dettori. Moore is odds-on to be the week’s top rider and Dettori is second-favourite at 3-1. If they both have a good week, any bookie with a thumping profit at the end of day five will have earned every penny.Any filling-in of that £17m hole, in other words, is unlikely to be much more than superficial – not that there will be any hint of incipient crisis in Berkshire itself.Royal Ascot is, it is said, the first engagement to be inked into the Queen’s diary each year, to ensure that nothing less important can get in the way. Do not tell Donald Trump but he probably took second billing in June behind a bunch of racehorses.The meeting has been immortalised on film and in literature, most famously in Ulysses, which James Joyce set on Gold Cup day in 1904 and littered with references to the Royal meeting’s main event. Cheltenham in March is a bigger event these days in betting terms but Royal Ascot is still the meeting with truly global recognition.The hope of a winner at Royal Ascot is why many of the billionaire owners who dominate Flat racing get involved with the sport in the first place. It is not about the money – there are plenty of races around the world that offer more cash to the winning owner. It is about the event, with all its traditions and trappings, from the moment the Royal procession makes its way down the track before racing each afternoon.The threatened strike on South West Trains will be a pain for many and the weather forecast, too, could be a little sunnier but the crowd and the occasion will look just as it has throughout the 67-year reign of the most racing-mad monarch since Charles II. Who knows, it might even be possible to blank out Brexit for a few precious hours at least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea48b3dd0be1709c08aeefc65b697e0e500eaf6e/0_0_3220_1932/master/3220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=609ea71fc8252c1bbc39e6ee18b9a123","title":"confessions of an expenses veteran","story":"Claiming back money spent on behalf of work is a fundamental part of the business-employee relationship, but the process is ripe for exploitation and muddled thinking. One anonymous writer shares their experiences of navigating the claim gameEveryone hates doing their expenses. It can feel like the admin equivalent of purgatory. So perhaps it’s no surprise that some of us employed in the creative industries have been known to extend our creativity to the task of claiming expenses.We’re not talking about nefarious fraud or fiddling, of course – typically it’s just about deploying a little imagination to avoid the boredom of doing them diligently. (Mind you, filling in overtime sheets for the hours spent poring creatively over an expenses claim could appear like gaming the system.)The trouble is, there are lots of grey areas. So when a car hire company chooses to reward a frequent renter with a red-blooded sports machine instead of the decidedly ordinary vehicle booked at the same price, that’s perfectly OK, right? Except that the snarling beast, even if driven at puppy-like speeds, uses twice the fuel. I must admit I felt a little guilty when I put in that claim for petrol.Ditto when I claimed for the cost of fuel for a work trip, without specifying that the petrol was high-grade aviation gas for refuelling a small plane, rather than supermarket-pump unleaded for a car.The UK’s HMRC collects some of the most outrageous attempts by taxpayers to claim spending as legitimate business expenses. My current favourite fail is insurance for a pet dog, at more than £750 for a year.One of the most common abuses is padding out expenses, usually by putting through additional claims for mileage because it’s so difficult to track and report on accurately.But some companies don’t exactly help themselves. A manager at a magazine house I worked at decided to circumvent his bosses’ ban on extra payments for overtime by telling the hard-working staff to put in fake expenses claims. Amazingly, that overflowing gravy train continued on its phantom branch line for years before it hit the buffers.I’ve also known managers to start bargaining over the percentage of a particular claim they are willing to allow, which just creates moral confusion over whether the expense is legitimate or not – and therefore undermines the credibility of the entire system.Other companies use archaic or cumbersome expenses software that is so time-consuming and difficult to use that it invites claims that are rounded – usually upwards, of course – or generously misremembered.A colleague tells me he feels no guilt at putting in claims for a few hours of renting light planes to keep his pilot’s licence – needed for work – alive. They may be enjoyable, sun-filled low-level jaunts over delightful countryside, but they are also vital for his job.I’ve also known people to claim for the rental of a fast car, along with the fuel and the necessary hotel stops, for a continental trip instead of taking an airliner – on the basis that it worked out at roughly the same cost. But this was before the days of ultra-low-cost airlines.And even before the recent moves to crack down on bribes, small gifts to ease the flow of commerce or information would routinely be described on expenses claims as “drinks”. Obviously, some of these actually were drinks. But the moral difference can sometimes feel murky when you start pondering whether buying multiple rounds of whisky for someone is substantively different from giving them a bottle of whisky.The question of what constitutes a legitimate expense is often far from straightforward. For instance, I once found myself facing a tricky moral dilemma when a speed-gun-wielding traffic policeman demanded a fine that was almost exactly equivalent to the cash float I had for upcoming expenses. In the end, I put it down to experience and did not doctor a claim to recoup the money. But I could have elected to do the opposite.It works the other way round too, though. The first time I went to Tokyo I was so appalled by the price of food that I didn’t eat for the first two days, despite being able to claim any such expenditure back.And I’ve never put in a claim as breathtakingly bizarre as some of those from British politicians that were revealed during the MPs’ expenses scandal that broke in 2009 – just a few examples of which include a duck house and £30,000 in gardening costs, two toilet seats, and labour costs to replace light bulbs. When lawmakers flout the rules, it does rather encourage lesser mortals to adopt a jaded view of the morality of keeping to them.According to a research paper on expense compliance issued in 2019 by software company SAP Concur, a fifth of employees found exaggerating claims acceptable, with those aged 18 to 24 even more likely to regard making false claims as normal. Fortunately, it’s now easier for businesses to manage the risk of fraudulent claims and ensure compliance with the help of automated expense management technology, such as Concur Expense. Technology can also make it much harder for employees to pad out mileage Concur Drive, for example, can track mileage while you’re driving and automatically populate an expenses claim.The rot can start early. I remember, as an impressionable teen, my then-girlfriend’s father telling me that when he was studying at Cambridge he was kept on an extremely tight financial leash by his father, who demanded to see minutely itemised accounts of his spending. Only after a couple of years did it dawn on the holder of the purse strings that his son was consuming an inordinate number of cream teas per week. In fact, roughly as many as the pints of beer any other student might consume …Fortunately my girlfriend’s dad went on to a glittering career in academia, so never had to revisit his talent for creative accounting. But the issue is still pertinent: the research found that low pay was one of the four main reasons given for guilt-free expense fiddling.My favourite story, though, involves a crisis of conscience by a foreign correspondent working for a national news organisation (not this one) in a country far, far away. He made so much money massaging his expenses that, on leaving the post, he felt he should present the office fixer with a car. He didn’t, however, tell the delighted recipient that it was paid for with just a small part of the hack’s pile of guilt-tinged lucre.SAP Concur provides intelligent solutions to help your business automate expenses on the go – giving you more freedom and the visibility you need to run your business more effectively.

During the past four years, the founder of Maple \u0026amp Co has used this virtue to open four healthy eating restaurants in London and plan the launch of another two for the end of the year.In between running her business, the Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef is a regular on TV cooking show Sunday Brunch, writes for health magazines, and mentors aspiring entrepreneurs. She manages her packed schedule by embracing the best of both new and old tech to maximise her efficiency. And her early morning starts, a focus on team management and her embrace of nifty productivity systems means there are still enough hours in the day for her to enjoy life beyond work – and even spend a bit of time in the kitchen with her first love: food.I normally wake up earlier on Monday mornings – around 4.30am. The rest of the week it’s usually around 5.30am. If I don’t set my week on Monday morning the rest of the week starts falling behind. I can’t work at night so early in the morning I find time to get organised for the day, get my thoughts sorted and understand my own priorities.I have a written to-do list. I know a lot of people on my team use the Sticky Notes function on their laptops so they always have it on their devices. I like having my quiet time in the mornings, if I’m having a cup of tea I don’t really want to get overwhelmed by my phone or laptop. I have my notebook instead and I can think without any distraction about what I need to get done for the day.I usually eat breakfast with my daughter after she wakes up. My mornings are spent with her until her nanny arrives at 10am. I try to squeeze in a quick one-hour workout either with my trainer, or on my Peloton bike – which lives in my room and is a constant reminder for me to work out.I calendarise everything. If I need an hour to check emails, I put it in the calendar, if I need half an hour for a call, I put that in my calendar. If my nanny is off for four hours or my husband needs to travel, that goes in as well. My staff also do it so I don’t bother them when their time is blocked off. I mix all my social plans and work into one big calendar, it’s a tool I find really, really important.Most days I have meetings here and there, but one day a week is dedicated to team meetings. I have about 30 people on my team and we all have one-to-one meetings with our direct reports. Throughout the week we use collaborative online docs to jot down any issues that come up that we want to discuss, for example, if I want to make changes to pricing. It means the team isn’t calling each other every time something happens at a store.It also means less time organising, updating and checking actionable points and more time to think strategically about the business. And it’s much more reliable to have things recorded on a page, as there’s a much lower risk of miscommunication.As a business we probably spend a disproportionate amount of time on good HR practices. It’s so important to have the right team supporting me. To make sure everyone is at their most productive, we ensure everyone’s job description is shared. So anyone from the kitchen porter to the head of operations has my job description and vice versa.I love leaving voice messages for the team on WhatsApp. I started doing this because some investors I work with are based abroad and calling long distance over the time zone differences is not so easy. Now, we all do it. For example, if my head chef goes to see some new central kitchens, he records photos, videos and two-minute voicemails that he sends over instead of writing everything down in an email. This simple technology really makes it much more efficient to communicate and share ideas.I take part in a mentorship program called Mentor Matcher. I take on up to two interns at a time and they come in at least three times a week. I come from a spreadsheet and PowerPoint background so they’re always showing me new and interesting tools. One of them introduced me to Canva for design – it is like Photoshop but online-based and much simpler to use. This reduces the time spent sharing files back and forth.I miss cooking a lot. I have a wonderful head chef who takes care of the day-to-day menus in stores. I don’t get to do as much physical cooking, but I do get to do some recipe testing. Right now, I’m working on a porridge recipe with a magazine and researching vegetable-based recipes for a show I’m presenting.I love having a glass of wine to wind down in the evening. Even though we do nutritious food at Maple and I teach and talk about all things healthy and amazing for your body, I find having a glass of wine really relaxing.I find my brain stops working around 8.30pm. I try to get home around 7pm and see my daughter before she goes to bed. I love to cook dinner at home and watch cooking shows or sitcoms on Netflix. The last thing I do is have a hot shower. I find it super relaxing and it’s one of my favourite things to do at night.SAP Concur provides intelligent solutions to help your business automate admin tasks such as expenses and invoices – giving you and your business the time and energy to focus on growing, innovating and making fruitful connections.

He had also served as regional health minister, representative of the ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf party, and adviser to Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan.Last week, however, Yousafzai found himself cast in an unlikely new role: cat person, with big pink ears. And whiskers.Yousafzai was giving a a briefing to reporters in Peshawar when a member of his social media team inadvertently switched on the cat filter. The event was streamed live on Facebook.It was several minutes before organisers realised that the minister had acquired pointy ears. When one of his moustached party colleagues began to speak, looking earnest and holding a pen, he too was transformed into a cat.Party followers watching online immediately started making jokes at the expense of Pakistan’s provincial Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. They offered up a whole series of feline puns.One suggested the middle-aged minister looked “kind of cute”. Another wrote “meow meow meow”.Yousafzai confirmed the cat incident and said other party colleagues had suffered the same fate.“I wasn’t the only one. Two officials sitting along me were also hit by the cat filter,” Yousafzai told the Agence France-Presse news agency. He added: “The cat filter was turned on by mistake. Let’s not take everything so seriously.”All necessary actions had been taken to prevent further cat incidents in future, he said. The party put out an official statement blaming “human error”. The culprit, it said, was a “hard-working volunteer”.The press conference went viral on Facebook, despite the stream being swiftly deleted. The party said it felt proud to have brought Pakistani politics to the internet.It said it had pioneered social media use in the country, and had high standards of etiquette thanks to a dedicated team of volunteers, it added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccdcff7e87467d71611e13429bc96e06d3d821d7/1342_1507_3680_2208/master/3680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a54136e3bbade8bd2a239af4ef5df6","title":"china is harvesting organs from detainees uk tribunal concludes","story":"Victims include imprisoned followers of Falun Gong movement, China Tribunal saysAn independent tribunal sitting in London has concluded that the killing of detainees in China for organ transplants is continuing, and victims include imprisoned followers of the Falun Gong movement.The China Tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who was a prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, said in a unanimous determination at the end of its hearings it was “certain that Falun Gong as a source - probably the principal source - of organs for forced organ harvesting”.“The conclusion shows that very many people have died indescribably hideous deaths for no reason, that more may suffer in similar ways and that all of us live on a planet where extreme wickedness may be found in the power of those, for the time being, running a country with one of the oldest civilisations known to modern man.”He added: “There is no evidence of the practice having been stopped and the tribunal is satisfied that it is continuing.”The tribunal has been taking evidence from medical experts, human rights investigators and others.Among those killed, it has been alleged, are members of religious minorities such as Falun Gong. Persecution of the group began in 1999 after it had attracted tens of millions of followers and came to be seen as a threat to the communist party.There is less evidence about the treatment of Tibetans, Uighur Muslims and some Christian sects.China announced in 2014 that it would stop removing organs for transplantation from executed prisoners and has dismissed the claims as politically-motivated and untrue.The tribunal was initiated by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (Etac) and its members, all of whom worked without payment, included medical experts.Waiting times for transplantation offered by hospitals in China were extraordinarily low, the tribunal noted, often only a couple of weeks.Investigators calling hospitals in China inquiring about transplants for patients, the tribunal said, have in the past been told that the source of some organs were from Falun Gong followers.Both former Falun Gong and Uighur inmates gave testimony of undergoing repeated medical testing in Chinese jails.Jennifer Zeng, a Falun Gong activist who was imprisoned for a year in a female labour camp, gave evidence to the China Tribunal about what she said were repeated medical check-ups and blood tests to which inmates were subjected.She told the : “On the day we were transferred to the labour camp, we were taken to a medical facility where we underwent physical check-ups. We were interrogated about what diseases we had and I told them I had hepatitis.“The second time, after about a month in the camp, everyone was handcuffed and put in a van and taken to a huge hospital. That was for a more thorough physical check-up. We were given X-rays. On the third occasion in the camp, they were drawing blood from us. We were all told to line up in the corridor and the test were given.”Zeng, who fled China in 2001, did not see any direct evidence of forced organ removal but since reading other accounts, she has questioned whether the tests were part of a medical selection process.In her statement to the tribunal, she said: “Inmates of the labour camp were not allowed to exchange contact details, so there was no way to trace each other after we were released. When anyone disappeared from the camp, I would assume that she was released and had gone home.“But in reality that cannot be confirmed, as I had no way to trace others after my release and I now fear they might have been taken to a hospital and had their organs removed without consent and thus killed in the process.”As many as 90,000 transplant operations a year are being carried out in China, the tribunal estimated, a far higher figure than that given by official government sources.There have been calls for the UK parliament to ban patients from travelling to China for transplant surgery. More than 40 MPs from all parties have backed the motion. Israel, Italy, Spain and Taiwan already enforce such restrictions.China insists it adheres to international medical standards that require organ donations to be made by consent and without any financial charges. It declined to participate in the tribunal.Commenting on the claims earlier this year, the Chinese embassy told the : “The Chinese government always follows the World Health Organization’s guiding principles on human organ transplant, and has strengthened its management on organ transplant in recent years. On 21 March 2007, the Chinese state council enacted the regulation on human organ transplant, providing that human organ donation must be done voluntarily and gratis. We hope that the British people will not be misled by rumours.”The tribunal heard reports of extraction of kidneys from executed prisoners from as far back as the 1970s. Most of the evidence, however, came from 2000 onwards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bdf75edf15a6ade1fa3326e9a9b294487a80a77/0_10_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37b0794d5c826212f8bc0ba4b0788c50","title":"guatemala election sandra torres runoff","story":"Guatemala’s presidential election was headed for a runoff as results on Monday gave the center-left candidate Sandra Torres a clear lead but far short of the outright majority needed to avoid a second round against a conservative rival.Early on Monday, Torres said she would work to forge alliances to win the second-round runoff, which is due to be held on 11 August.“The country needs unity: to unite the countryside with the city, to unite the workers with the business community, and also in civil society, in all sectors,” she told reporters.The head of the electoral tribunal said late on Sunday it could take approximately two weeks to have definitive results from across the Central American country.Guatemala’s next president faces the difficult task of curbing drug gang violence that has ravaged the country and helped spur illegal immigration to the United States, souring relations with Donald Trump.Torres, of the center-left Une party, has for weeks led the race to succeed President Jimmy Morales, a conservative former blackface comedian whose term has been blighted by accusations of corruption made by UN-backed investigators.Nevertheless, Torres also has high negative ratings and may struggle to win a direct runoff if supporters of the many right-of-center candidates unite against her.Torres, who wants to send troops into the streets to fight drug gangs, and use welfare programs to tackle poverty, extended a hand to Guatemala’s business elite when voting on Sunday.Rampant violence and widespread discontent over corruption and impunity in the country of 17 million have prompted more and more Guatemalans to flee for the United States.The surge of departures has undermined Trump’s pledge to curb illegal immigration, and the US president has responded by threatening to cut US aid to Central America.That prospect has caused alarm in Guatemala, where the legacy of the bloody 1960-1996 civil war still casts a long shadow over the country’s development.President Morales, who is barred by law from seeking re-election, took office in 2016 vowing to end corruption after his predecessor was brought down by an investigation led by the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Cicig).Instead, Morales himself became a target of a Cicig investigation into allegations of campaign finance wrongdoing and was subject to impeachment proceedings in 2017.He survived the attempt to oust him, and then engaged in a bitter dispute with the Cicicg before finally terminating its mandate, effective from September.None of the top contenders has unequivocally backed the Cicig, with Torres saying she would consider holding a referendum on whether it should remain in Guatemala."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9881731ec273e03d770c0f9ab4bdd931408b3c4b/44_0_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce4245100b89a046c5a08eb7ee18f278","title":"ireland to unveil bold plan to tackle climate emergency","story":"Varadkar reveals ideas to curb greenhouse gases and move towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050Ireland has unveiled an ambitious plan to tackle the climate emergency by weaning the state, businesses, farms and households off fossil fuels.The government published a long-awaited report on Monday outlining more than 180 measures to curb the country’s greenhouse gas emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.It envisages a rise in carbon taxes, a multibillion-euro scheme to retro-fit houses, almost a million electric vehicles and a number of other measures to change behaviour by institutions, companies and iniduals.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: “We are going to change how electricity is produced and consumed, how our homes and workplaces are heated the way we travel the types of vehicles we purchase, and how food is produced. Above all, we are going to decouple emissions growth from economic growth … This plan represents the sum of our hopes for the future.”Ireland is one of the European Union’s worst carbon emission offenders and is facing fines of more than €250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing emissions and adopting renewable energy.Trends in agriculture and transport mean that emissions are set to continue rising in the next few years, risking even steeper fines for missing 2030 goals and raising questions over if and how Ireland will make its bold plan a reality.The Fine Gael-led centre-right government is entering a general election cycle and is wary of alienating poorer and rural voters with higher carbon taxes – the trigger for France’s yellow-vest protests. However, support for Ireland’s Green party surged in local and European elections last month, reflecting growing concern over the climate crisis.The Climate Action Plan to Tackle Climate Breakdown drew on a report published earlier this year by an all-party committee.The report also commits Ireland to 2030 EU goals – to avert fines estimated at €6bn, it must slash emissions from 60m to 33m tonnes – by planting more trees and buying carbon credits from other countries.The central strategy involves increasing carbon taxes from €20 to €80 per tonne by 2030 – a politically fraught exercise that will require cushioning poor people and rural dwellers from higher fuel and heating prices.Another measure targets financial services: pension providers will have to disclose whether they hold fossil fuel assets, giving pension-holders the option to switch providers. Leftwing parties, including Sinn Fèin, have opposed a carbon tax increase, while farmers have assailed Varadkar for saying he is trying to eat less meat to reduce his carbon footprint. Protesters greeted him last month with the chant: “Where’s the beef, you vegan?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12e0af3897bfba4fe73885b30477de5a66a8627b/0_227_5334_3200/master/5334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0a7d7fdbe8340f84adc40edc426cefe","title":"matteo salvini italy closer washington ties as eu tensions rise","story":"Hard-right leader speaks on arrival in US of ‘common vision’ with Trump administration amid EU turmoilMatteo Salvini has said Italy wants to be Washington’s closest partner in Europe during the hard-right leader’s visit to the US capital for talks with the Trump administration.Salvini made it clear that he sees an opportunity to forge a closer US-Italian relationship at a time of European turmoil and alignment between populist governments in both countries.After a meeting with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, Italy’s deputy prime minister told journalists: “At a moment when European Union institutions are fragile and changing significantly, Italy wants to be the most solid, effective, coherent and credible partner for the US.”Salvini was also due to meet the vice-president, Mike Pence, in the White House on Monday, and it was left unclear whether there would also be a brief encounter with Donald Trump, as a gesture of political support.Salvini has been nurturing relations with Trump since the latter’s presidential election campaign, and has said that while other countries have “chosen different paths”, Italy wanted to return to being the “most important partner in continental Europe for the biggest western democracy”.“And not only for economic and commercial interests,” he told reporters after arriving in Washington. “But also due to our common vision of the world, of values, of work, family and rights.”Salvini attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier at Arlington national cemetery on Monday before going to the White House. Salvini, whose far-right League party is proposing a flat tax, will also meet Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform.In its account of the trip, the state department said Pompeo and Salvini talked about “confronting regional security risks from Russia and Iran, the threat posed by China’s predatory investments in key infrastructure and technology in Italy and Europe, and the need for strengthened US-Italy defence cooperation.”Salvini has long admired Trump, posing for a selfie with him during the 2016 presidential campaign and displaying a “Make America Great Again” cap in the background while filming a thank-you message to supporters after victory in the EU elections.“It’s obvious that Salvini is preparing to become prime minister and so, like all premiers who go to the US, he is seeking to get support,” said Alfonso Giordano, a politics professor at Rome’s Luiss University.Such support might be more forthcoming if the League split with the M5S, which angered the US after spearheading Italy’s signing of a memorandum of understanding with China to join the controversial Belt and Road project, and for refusing to recognise the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as president.This month the EU paved the way towards fining Italy£3.1bn for failing to reduce its debt.“The infraction procedure could be a way to push Italy into a corner,” added Giordano. “And so the trip to the US is also a way to let it be known that Italy is not completely isolated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/947bc8bce11107b94293df4a227e4540ce55f35d/1470_802_4038_2423/master/4038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08fa59d30bfa1ab145951d343091902d","title":"quebec law hijab ban religious symbols public employees","story":"Civil liberties groups vow to challenge new law that bans public employees from wearing religious symbolsCivil liberties and Muslim groups have vowed to challenge a new law in the Canadian province of Quebec that bans some public sector employees from wearing religious symbols during work hours, arguing it triggered the “politics of fear”.Critics said the long-expected Bill 21 that was passed by the predominately French-speaking province’s legislature on Sunday mainly targeted Muslim women who wear hijabs.“We will be filing a challenge to the law,” said Mustafa Farooq, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. “I think Bill 21 is a law that will do irreparable harm to communities in Quebec.“This creates a second-class citizenship,” he said, adding that the group would seek a court injunction to block the law that he called “a recipe for the politics of fear”.The law covers public workers in positions of authority, including teachers, judges and police officers, but exempts current government employees and civil servants.It sets the province’s center-right Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) government on a collision course with the Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who promotes religious freedom, in a federal election year where Quebec is a vital battleground.“Our position is clear: it’s not up to politicians to tell people what to wear or not to wear,” said Simon Ross, a spokesman for Canada’s minister of Canadian heritage and multiculturalism, Pablo Rodriguez.“Canada is already a secular state and that is reflected in our institutions. This new law undermines fundamental rights and inidual freedoms because it forces some people to choose between their religion and their job. We will monitor the implementation of the law.”Governments in Quebec have been trying for years to restrict civil servants from wearing overt religious symbols like headscarves and Jewish skullcaps at work in an effort to cement a secular society.Quebec’s immigration minister, Simon Jolin-Barrette, argued in a statement on Monday that “it is legitimate for the Quebec nation to decide in which form secularism applies in its territory and in its institutions”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3923149.1560506526!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"don t forget to pack travel insurance this summer","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDon’t leave it until the last minute to get travel insurance  - almost 40 per cent of the claims are made before travel with illness and death the most likely reasons for cancelled holidays We all get hung up on packing like Ninjas at this time of year as we ready ourselves for holidays overseas and look to save ourselves the costs associated with checked-in bags.

Photograph: Jack TaylorGetty ImagesThe Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has cancelled a summer drinks reception for Stormont politicians due to a lack of interest.On Monday evening a Northern Ireland Office (NIO) statement said what had been billed as an informal drinks reception hosted by Karen Bradley — for politicians to engage alongside the talks process aimed at restoring the Assembly — was not going ahead at Stormont House on Tuesday.An NIO spokesman said: “The Secretary of State considered that it would be valuable to bring together MLAs for an informal event alongside the ongoing talks process. This was part of the drive to make the process more inclusive, beyond those who sit around the talks table, and to help build relationships ahead of the restoration of the Assembly. “The Secretary of State respects that the parties have concluded they are not ready for this yet. The event will therefore not take place.”Sinn Féin was first to reject the party invite on Sunday. Its deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said she would “absolutely not” be attending the event. Ms O’Neill also said Ms Bradley, the talks chair, had “failed left, right and centre” in her role as Northern Secretary.Then on Monday the Alliance Party, the DUP and the SDLP also indicated they would not be attending.DUP MP Gavin Robinson described the proposed event as “unhelpful” to the talks process. An SDLP statement said: “The public wants us working to secure a return to government rather than attending drinks receptions.”The North has been without government since January 2017 when the Executive and Assembly collapsed in part over the handling of a botched green energy scheme.

Victims have allegedly had their bodies cut open - some while still alive - for their kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs, cornea and skin to be removed and turned into commodities for sale.However today for the first time, an independent tribunal concluded that China is a “criminal state” which, “beyond reasonable doubt” has committed crimes against humanity, acts of torture, and that enemies of the state continue to be medically tested and killed for their organs.The Independent Tribunal Into Forced Organ Harvesting of Prisoners of Conscience in China, known as the China Tribunal, heard evidence from medical experts, human rights investigators and alleged victims over a six-month period.In a judgment lasting an hour-and-a-half and read out before hundreds of people including international media in London the Tribunal Chairman, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who led the prosecution of Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal, criticised the British government for failing to act.Tribunal Chairman, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who led the prosecution of Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal, criticised the British government for failing to act   He said that the British government has “sought to dismiss the allegations without making a judgement based on consideration of known facts and evidence”, thereby enabling it to avoid finding “an inconvenient truth”.He added: “Countries testing grave allegations and not letting the PRC escape oversight could have helped the PRC to understand that the practice in which it was engaged had to stop if it was to find a place in the world of something more than an enormously powerful commercial partner and competitor of other states, large and small.”Dr Enver Tohti, 57, was among those who gave evidence to the Tribunal. He was working as a surgeon in Urumqi in northwest China in 1995 when he was asked by his bosses: “do you want to do something wild?”.As a keen young doctor, he said yes and the following day he was driven to the Western Mountain Execution Grounds where he saw around 15 bodies on the mountain side. All of them had been shot in the head.However he was ordered to “cut deep and work fast” on one victim whom he claimed had not been anaesthetised and who had been shot in the chest.“I started cutting down the middle and then he started struggling and I knew then that he was still alive,” the father-of-three told The , “but he was too weak to resist me.”“I saw there was blood coming out of the cut which means the heart is still pumping,” he added. He was ordered to remove the liver and both kidneys, sew the body back up, and “remember that today nothing happened”.Dr Tothi, who now works as an Uber driver in the UK, has suffered flashbacks and nightmares following the incident and now dedicates his life to campaigning for awareness of the practice.Followers of Falun Gong, a religious spiritual practice, were certainly among those used as a source for forced organ harvesting in recent decades - and there was a risk that Uighur Muslims have suffered similar treatment, the Tribunal found.China | Read more from The The Tribunal alleged that hospitals could request organs to be extracted on demand from donors - without their consent.Yesterday The  revealed that almost 20 children and adults at risk of having their organs harvested  by criminal gangs or authorities have fled to the UK in recent years. Sir Geoffrey said that when asked questions in Parliament, Baroness Goldie and Mark Field, Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific, referred to ‘analysis’ and ‘assessment’ of the available material as to why they had reached the conclusion that there is “insufficient evidence” to confirm that organ harvesting is ongoing.As a result, the Tribunal contacted Mr Field, asking for this “analysis or assessment that must exist” and inviting him to give evidence, which he declined.“No analysis of the kind - that certainly should exist - has been provided and the answers by ministers to questions in both Houses of Parliament do nothing to explain the Government’s position apart from by their placing some reliance on the World Health Organisation,” Sir Geoffrey concluded.“Governments around the world and international organisations, all required to protect the rights of mankind, have expressed doubt as to the accusations thereby justifying their doing nothing to save those who were indue course to be killed to order,” he added.There is currently no law in the UK preventing British patients travelling to China for transplant surgery.A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokeswoman said: “Of course any claims of organ harvesting are disturbing. We have noted this report and will read it carefully.“The UK government is very concerned about Human Rights in China, and Ministers raise these concerns regularly with their Chinese counterparts.”A statement from the Chinese Embassy said: The Chinese government always follows the World Health Organization\u0027s guiding principles on human organ transplant, and has strengthened its management on organ transplant in recent years.Jeremy Hunt faces backlash after saying he agrees \u0026#39150 percent\u0026#39 with Donald Trump\u0026#39s latest attack on Sadiq KhanDying Army veteran facing \u0026#39final years of total hell\u0026#39 as trial over Troubles killing 45 years ago loomsEight NHS hospitals hit by listeria outbreaks as Hancock signals plans to bring catering in-house Facebook posts can be used to identify anxiety, depression and psychosis, new study suggestsGet close to the Mona Lisa... in Virtual RealityWahaca founder criticised after waiters forced to pay the bill of \u0026#39dine and dash\u0026#39 customersSuspect in German MP murder \u0026#39has links to British neo-Nazi group\u0026#39\u0026#39Puppy dog eyes\u0026#39 are an evolutionary trick to manipulate humans, say scientistsBurrowing badgers blamed for catastrophic flooding that forced hundreds from their homesBoaty McBoatface makes major climate change discovery on maiden outingLabour chaos over Brexit deepens as Tom Watson calls for special party conferenceFreak hailstorms prompt French authorities to declare \u0026#39natural emergency\u0026#39Trial begins for gang accused of holding Toulouse businessman hostage in camper-van for two monthsComment: Channel 4 News has moved from gentle bias into full-blown activismPower restored after massive blackout in Argentina as officials investigate causeDozen capybaras die at Heathrow Airport after being kept in cramped conditions with no water for 56 hoursLove Island\u0026#39s Maura Higgins accused of sexually harassing Tommy Fury as Ofcom receives hundreds of complaintsComment: Rory Stewart may seem eccentric.

But there is a catch.The unrivalled access will be delivered via a virtual reality (VR) headset, because the real painting will not be included in the show. A spokesman for the exhibition said it cannot deprive regular visitors of seeing the Louvre’s most popular artwork.Instead, viewers will go into an empty room and put on the headset for an “immersive” experience in which the crowds magically evaporate and the wearer will “step behind the glass to access the intriguing portrait up close in an entirely new, transformative way”.Every brushstroke will be clear, and a voiceover will explain Da Vinci’s methods with reference to the latest scientific research.Entitled Mona Lisa: Behind The Glass, it is the Louvre’s first VR experience and is being billed as “an intimate look at a painting which has been the subject of fascination and intrigue for generations”.The real Mona Lisa may not be the only Da Vinci masterwork missing from the exhibition, which opens on October 24 and marks the 500th anniversary of the artist’s death.There is still no announcement on whether the Salvator Mundi will be included in the show. It became the world’s most expensive painting when it sold for $450 million in 2017, but a question mark hangs over whether it truly is one of the artist’s works.The Louvre has requested it on loan from its new owner, said to be Saudi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but negotiations appear to have stalled.It is said that Louvre curators wish to label it only as “from the workshop” of Leonardo, which would effectively render it all but worthless. The painting has not been seen in public since it was purchased and is reportedly being kept aboard the crown prince’s superyacht.A Louvre spokesman said: “There is nothing new on this subject: the Musee du Louvre has asked for the painting for its exhibition and is waiting for an answer from the owner.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

This can lead to stunting in children, who then go on to suffer cognitive delays, weakened immunity and disease. Pregnant women who lack micronutrients are more likely to have babies with defects or low birthweight.Potato is a staple crop in many parts of the world and researchers at the International Potato Centre (CIP) in Peru believe that a biofortified variety could have an important role to play in improving diets.After rice and maize potato is the third most consumed food in the world so increasing its micronutrient content would make a significant difference to people’s health around the globe, said Dr Oscar Ortiz, director of the CIP.Stunting | A silent emergency threatening millions of young lives“Potato already has proteins, iron, zinc and vitamin C and it is also an extremely good source of fibre. It’s a well balanced food if consumed boiled or baked. But we can make it even better,” he said.Potatoes may have developed an image problem in recent years with the move to “low carb” diets but Dr Ortiz believes this is mainly because of the way they are consumed as chips or fries.Work on biofortification of the potato began in 2004 as researchers looked through a gene bank of around 200 varieties from countries around the Andes - where the potato originated.Researchers identified 16 native varieties with high levels of iron, zinc and vitamin C and then spent more than a decade crossing these types with each other to produce varieties with even higher levels of micronutrients.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionThese were then crossed with other types of potato with high yields and good resistance to disease such as blight. These varieties have 40 to 80 per cent more iron than types currently grown in the Andes.Now these potatoes are being tested to see if they grow in other parts of the world: clones are being grown in Rwanda and Kenya and will soon be introduced to Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal.Researchers are also conducting bioavailability testing to see whether the increased iron content of the potato is absorbed by the human body. Once this is confirmed Dr Ortiz believes that the new varieties will be available within the next two years.“If we can confirm this, which is a critical milestone, the potato will be available in 2021,” he said.Studies show that consuming 600g of these potatoes a day, as is common in most areas of the Peruvian highlands, could provide up to 75 per cent of the recommended daily allowance of iron and zinc.“We are not saying only eating potato will solve the iron deficiencies of the world but it will be part of a erse diet where other sources of nutrients are needed,” he added.CIP’s approach has already been tested with sweet potato fortified with vitamin A – groundbreaking work which in 2016 won the World Food Prize, the “Nobel prize” for food.New research has shown that since 2013 more than 2.3 million households in Africa and Asia have been given sweet potato cuttings to grow themselves.New green revolution | £100m to fund \u0026#039super-crops\u0026#039“Their work has shown that 120g of sweet potato a day can provide 100 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A intake. It’s a really good example of how biofortification can contribute to reducing micronutrient deficiency,” said Dr Ortiz.The biofortified sweet potato also contains high levels of vitamins B6 and C, manganese and potassium.Dr Ortiz added that fortifying food at source was better than doing it during the production process. The UK government has announced it intends to fortify flour with folic acid to reduce the number of babies born with spina bifida or anencephaly, where the majority of the brain never develops.“If it becomes part of the diet and is consumed every day it is a much more sustainable way of accessing micronutrients. Sweet potatoes and potatoes are cultivated by vulnerable people who are far away from governments so having these crops is a better option for them,” he said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityJeremy Hunt faces backlash after saying he agrees \u0026#39150 percent\u0026#39 with Donald Trump\u0026#39s latest attack on Sadiq KhanDying Army veteran facing \u0026#39final years of total hell\u0026#39 as trial over Troubles killing 45 years ago loomsEight NHS hospitals hit by listeria outbreaks as Hancock signals plans to bring catering in-house Facebook posts can be used to identify anxiety, depression and psychosis, new study suggestsGet close to the Mona Lisa... in Virtual RealityWahaca founder criticised after waiters forced to pay the bill of \u0026#39dine and dash\u0026#39 customersSuspect in German MP murder \u0026#39has links to British neo-Nazi group\u0026#39\u0026#39Puppy dog eyes\u0026#39 are an evolutionary trick to manipulate humans, say scientistsBurrowing badgers blamed for catastrophic flooding that forced hundreds from their homesBoaty McBoatface makes major climate change discovery on maiden outingLabour chaos over Brexit deepens as Tom Watson calls for special party conferenceFreak hailstorms prompt French authorities to declare \u0026#39natural emergency\u0026#39Trial begins for gang accused of holding Toulouse businessman hostage in camper-van for two monthsComment: Channel 4 News has moved from gentle bias into full-blown activismPower restored after massive blackout in Argentina as officials investigate causeDozen capybaras die at Heathrow Airport after being kept in cramped conditions with no water for 56 hoursLove Island\u0026#39s Maura Higgins accused of sexually harassing Tommy Fury as Ofcom receives hundreds of complaintsComment: Rory Stewart may seem eccentric.

He immediately gave as speech in which he declared not to be omnipotent. He said I’m not a god.“He admitted his part in the error before resigning from the defence council.“This was all in preparation for the purge and to squash discontent and explain how he’d misunderstood Trump.”The dictator has modelled himself as one of the people after his grandfather Kim Il-sung, North Koreas beloved first leader, which would explain why he admitted his fault for the disastrous Hanoi summit, Dr Hemmings said.In his meeting with the brash New Yorker, Kim reportedly asked for economic sanctions against North Korea to be dropped infor the part-dismantling of his nuclear arsenal.Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo balked at the dictator’s terms and walked away from the meeting.Since then, there have been numerous reports of foreign ministry being executed following the failure of the summit.However, reports that Kim Hyok-chol, the former envoy to the US, was killed in March have proved to be .Another official, Kim Yong-chol was reported to have been sent to a concentration camp – however he was recently pictured at an event with the despot.Dr Hemmings, who briefs the UK Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence on matters relating to Asia, said that it is hard to very stories about the “utterly bizarre” regime which has been a diplomatic basket case for decades.He said: “In  years of covering North Korea it is still impossible to know what is anecdotal and what is true.“Its hard to know whether these are rumours being fed by the regime to create fear ortheyre made up by North Koreas enemies.”However, the expert said he has no reason to doubt reports of officials being executed following the Trump summit.He said: “Kim was clearly angry. So I dont doubt there are purges and that people are being removed and punished - they might be sent out to labour camps or they may be executed.”Dr Hemmings added that dictators such as Kim view purges as “a necessary exercise” to maintain their ruthless grip on power.He said that the -year-old styles himself after his revered grandfather Kim Il-sung whose cult of personality dominates le in the rogue state.Dr Hemmings said: “Hes trying to be more like his grandfather - the way he dresses. He has the same buzz cut hairstyle“Kim also tried to be a little more regular - even though I know this sounds really contrary to what weve seen - he still tries to be a regular guy.“His resignation from that position is another example of this.“When he was in Singaporehe talked about reforming the country.“So hes trying to go after his own grandfathers image which was more beloved to the people. ““Kim has tried to move away from the ‘godhood of the family” - he even gave that speech after Vietnam where he professed his mortality and resigned from a position.“Thats someone who is trying to create an image of just another man suffering with his people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scrap tv licenses oap","story":"It would be dead without those of us who remember Top Of The Pops, Blackadder, Harry Carpenter, Boys From The Blackstuff, Kenneth Wolstenholme, the Dimblebys, The Likely Lads, Monty Python’s Flying Circus and the Hairy Cornflake.By stupidly scrapping free TV licences for .million people aged over , the BBC just burst its own golden bubble.

This bloated, arrogant corporation has been indulged, protected and bankrolled for too long.The fat cats at the BBC need to tighten their bulging belts. Sky-high salaries need to come down. Grotesque waste — like the annual BBC beano to Glastonbury — has to be cut back.The BBC’s expansionist digital empire needs dialling down. Profligate BBC bosses must start to live within their means. £billion a year is plenty. And, yes, we need to start a national debate about the relevance of the licence fee in the modern world.And above all, the BBC needs to start showing some respect to the older citizens of this country. Because this breaking news just in.Nobody  is watching.JOKING about throwing battery acid in someone’s face is exactly like joking about rape. It will never – and can never – be funny, no matter how much you disagree with the views of the person who is being raped or disfigured by acid.Luckily for Jo Brand, she did not recommend throwing battery acid at a Labour MP or a member of an ethnic community. They would never have let her inside Broadcasting House again.But because Jo only joshed about throwing battery acid at right-wing politicians, her paydays at the BBC are safe.And although Brand was investigated by the police, I suspect the BBC now loves her even more.The comic insists she was joking and would never encourage anyone to throw battery acid at a politician for daring to have views that Jo disagrees with, likewe should possibly respect democracy and leave the EU.What a relief. And I will say this in Jo’s defence – I never saw anyone less likely to throw away a calorie-stuffed milkshake than this cruel, unfunny, virtue-signalling fatberg. Just kidding, Jo!And can we please stop referring to the children abused in Haiti as “prostitutes”  What happened with those girls in Haiti, some as young as  , was not prostitution. It was survival sex.If you are starving in a disaster zone, you do not have sex with a middle-aged charity worker for money. You do it to stay alive.AFTER Michael Gove’s cocaine confession, Boris Johnson was mocked for saying that he was not sure that he actually took the drug.But the scary truth is that nobody ever really knows what they are putting up their nose because this stuff is not regulated.It comes with no list of ingredients. There is no quality control. Cocaine is routinely cut with talcum powder, icing sugar and worse.Anyone who takes “cocaine” might believe they are on the real-deal Bolivian marching power, but you simply never know.It could easily be rat poison you are putting up your hooter. That is why I always warn my children that they should never touch cocaine with a barge pole, or indeed a rolled-up fiver.THE Cannes Film Festival was agog at the sight of ­Vietnamese model Ngoc Trinh, who rocked up to the premiere of A Hidden Le, Terrence Malick’s painfully po-faced film about a conscientious objector in World War Two, wearing a mere rumour of a little black dress.Since ing to Vietnam, Ngoc has been heavily criticised by the Vietnamese government, who have launched an enquiry into whether she violated the country’s public decency laws.“I don’t carepeople criticise it because I felt pretty in the dress, which made a good impression on the Cannes red carpet,” said Ngoc.The Vietnamese authorities should give the girl a break. She is a fine ambassador for their wonderful country.

When Greggs brought out the Vegan Sausage roll I was in heaven.“There are all sorts of places that do vegetarian junk food but for me it’s always been a novelty – my friends were getting a sausage roll when hungover and I couldn’t do that.“I was always quite jealous because it’s so quick and easy and it’s only £- being a vegetarian is so much more expensive, you have to find alternatives.She added: “My favourite one is a Greggs in Salisbury, close to where I live, there is a bench outside - it’s my hangover spot when I go home.My friends think it’s probably the most hilarious thing I’ve ever done in my le.But now Im on a mission."},{"url":null,"title":"furniture maker sweeping factory ban","story":"They insist a broom raises wood dust that can be harmful and want him to fork out for a £, industrial vacuum cleaner to clean up instead.Defiant Michael, , who has used a broom for four decades without any problems, said: “It’s a load of rubbish. My message to the health and safety executives is, ‘Sorry, I’m not doing it. The broom stays’.“I’ve been managing factories for over  years and never have I come across such a joke.“This isn’t something I can choose to do or not do. I’ve been told I have to ban the use of dry sweeping and must confirm with them by a particular date that I’ve complied with their requirements.“If I ignore these guys it will get pretty heavy — but I’m up for the fight. I’m going to pick up my broom and get back to work.”Michael, whose customers include Theresa May, Adele and Brazilian football legend Ronaldo, was stunned when the Health and Safety Executive ordered a broom ban after inspecting his factory in Leyton, East London.They said sweeping sawdust was exposing his ten workers to “a substance hazardous to heath, namely airborne wood dust”.A strongly-worded letter told him to “prohibit” dry-sweeping and “provide evidence of compliance” within weeks.The letter even included a picture of the dangerous broom.Michael was charged £ an hour for the two-hour inspection of his factory earlier this month.He will continue to be charged the whopping hourly rate during his appeal for the time the HSE takes replying to letters.Michael said the problem comes down to the HSE not knowing how to use a broom properly.He added: “They have a nonsense video on their website showing someone using a huge yard broom with stf bristles to sweep up a massive pile of sawdust.“The bristles are too long and they’re lting the broom off the floor, kicking up dust.“Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows brooms should be pushed and kept on the floor. Use a nice short one with soft bristles — just like mine.“Using commercial vacuums means power cables will be running everywhere, no doubt causing a bigger risk than my little old broomstick ever poses. This is the sort of rot that makes companies move manufacturing abroad.”Let’s sweep away this cowardice and get a bit more common sense.The HSE said: “While it is simply not the case that HSE has banned the use of broomsticks, companies are being encouraged to use one of the many safer and more efficient types of equipment where the health of workers is better protected.“Prolonged exposure to high levels of wood dust is known to be one of the direct causes of the high number of cases of occupational asthma and nasal cancer suffered by people in the woodworking industry.Ken Veal, secretary of the British Woodcarvers Association, said: “The concept of not sweeping with a broom is daft.”The first written reference  to witches on broomsticks was in .  Harry Potter famously flies on one  for Quidditch, below.  Angela Lansbury gets airborne the same way in   Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks.In TV’s Only Fools And Horses roadsweeper Trigger claims to have had the same broom for  years.

Her skull had  fractures, her left eye was dislodged from its socket. She lost more than  per cent of her blood, had severe hypothermia and a priest was summoned to the hospital to read the last rites.Within hours, five young black and Hispanic boys were arrested, and four confessed on camera.New Yorkers were horried that their beloved green space had been turned into a hunting ground for violent rapists. Mayor Ed Koch branded the perpetrators “monsters” and a local tycoon named Donald Trump called for their executions.But they were innocent.Now the story of the Central Park Five and their -year fight for justice has been told in Netflix drama series When They See Us.The four-parter, which has earned rave reviews, starts with the fateful night of April , .Trisha, dressed in black leggings and a white T-shirt, left her Upper East Side apartment just before pm.The circular route usually took  minutes, taking her past the politan Museum of Art, then brushing past the much poorer and ethnically erse district of Harlem.The park had fallen into disrepair in the s, suffering from vandalism and neglect. But at the time of the rape the tide was starting to turn after an £million renovation restored landmarks, lawns and gardens.That a -year-old woman felt safe jogging alone through the park at pm is testament to how its reputation had been re-built.But  minutes into her run, Trisha was coshed across the back of her head with a tree branch, dragged  feet into woods and assaulted.Four hours later, builders found her battered body and called the emergency services.Police picked up five Harlem teenagers in connection with a string of assaults carried out in the park in an activity known as “wilding”. These were Yusef Salaam, , Korey Wise, , Antron McCray, , Kevin Richardson,  and Raymond Santana Jr, .They were interrogated for up to  hours, sometimes with no parents present. Yusef later said they had been coerced into confessing, saying: “Police deprived us of food, drink or sleep for more than  hours.”It is claimed the boys were played off against each other, with police telling Raymond Santana that they had evidence against Kevin Richardson and Raymond could go homehe helped them.Yusef added: “As soon as we get in, they separate us and they start working on us. I’m hearing Korey being physically beaten in the next room. I’m immediately beyond afraid.”Raymond said recently: “You got to look at the landscape. You have to look at the fact that we’re , , -year-old kids who had never had involvement with the law, who had no criminal record.“And these are seasoned detectives. So going into that situation, the playing field is already unlevel.”Only the confessions were filmed, not the hours of interviews that led to them. Now  US states require electronic records of full interrogations, after a campaign by the five.But back in  a city riven by racial tension was gunning for justice. Long before he had designs on the White House, Donald Trump took out an advert in four New York news- papers calling for the of the death penalty.In the ad, which did not specically refer to the five, Trump wrote: “I want to hate these murderers and I always will. I am not looking to psychoanalyse or understand them, I am looking to punish them.”After two trials the teens were convicted of offences including attempted murder, rape, assault and robbery. Yusef said later: “I was . My aspirations were to watch The Cosby Show at night and to skateboard. They pointed at me and described me in a matter I could not recognise.”Miraculously, Trisha made an almost complete recovery, barring some problems with balance and loss  of vision. At the time her identity was protected, but in  she wrote a memoir, I Am The Central Park Jogger. She left her job and has since worked with sexual assault victims and as a motivational speaker.In prison, the five were equally determined to reclaim their lives. In  murderer and serial rapist Matias Reyes met Korey Wise when they were both moved to the same jail. The chance encounter, together with finding religion, prompted Reyes to confess to Trisha’s assault.In  he gave police details of the crime which had not been made public, and DNA evidence supported his confession.The convictions of the Central Park Five were overturned and in  they received a settlement payment of £million — though the money cannot erase their mental scars.Antron McCray, , now a dad of six living in Atlanta, Georgia, said: “I’m damaged. It eats me up every day.” Yusef, who has ten children and also lives in Georgia, has devoted his le to fighting for criminal justice reform. In , then-President   Barack Obama honoured him with a Letime Achievement Award.Korey Wise has also turned to activism, donating £, of his settlement to Colorado’s Innocence Project, which campaigns for reforms to the criminal justice system.After his release, Raymond Santana initially ed to prison twice, for a parole violation and for possessing crack cocaine. He has since founded a clothing company.Kevin Richardson, who lives in New Jersey with his we and two children, said: “We always say we have invisible scars nobody sees.“No matter how you cover it, the scab will keep coming off.”In  lawyers for the group called for Trump to apologise, but he refused, even after protesters picketed his New York business headquarters, Trump Tower.When the men received their settlement, Trump wrote in the New York Daily News: “Settling doesn’t mean innocence but it indicates incompetence on several levels.”Actor Joshua Jackson, who plays a lawyer in When They See Us, is outraged at Trump’s part in the tale.He told the Hollywood Reporter magazine: “He was calling for the murder of children. That’s the  President of the United States. The murder of children.”The drama’s director, Ava DuVernay said: “In their journey, we witness five innocent young men of colour who were met with injustice at every turn, from coerced confessions to unjust incarceration to public calls for their execution by the man who would go on to be the President of the United States.”And since When They See Us was released on Netflix on May , Linda Fairstein, the Central Park Five prosecutor — who maintains the confessions were not coerced — has resigned from the board of trustees at New York’s Vassar College and has been dropped by her publisher.There are petitions and social media calls for a boycott of her books.Another prosecutor, Elizabeth Lederer, has resigned as a  professor at Columbia Law School following protests by black students.Finally, after  years, the Five are certainly being seen now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not surprising from ChannelRemain’.”Brexit supporters watching the debate accused Channel  of bias and picking a Remain audience.Junior Brexit minister James Cleverly added: “This Channel  debate is geared up to encourage Conservative leadership candidates to knock chunks out of each other.“That’s not how this campaign should be conducted.“It’s probably good for Channel ’s viewing figures but I’m astonished that so many candidates are playing along.”A spokesman for Channel  denied the debate audience or set-up had been biased to any one candidate.“Each candidate had a fair opportunity to participate,” the spokesman said.Boris Johnson was blasted by Mr Hunt for dodging the first TV debate of the contest, with Channel  leaving an empty podium for the bookies favourite.In a bid to breathe new le into his campaign, the Foreign Secretary ripped into his opponent for ducking out – and said it highlighted the doubts over his Brexit credentials.He stormed: “If Boris’s team won’t let him out to debate five pretty friendly colleagues, how will he get on with  EU countries ”Aid Secretary Rory Stewart later drew rounds of applause for saying he hoped the next Prime Minister was “one of us” in the room.Boris Johnson’s no show dominated the -minute event – staged on a set that mimicked the TV quiz show Pointless.But the battle for second place got personal as the remaining five ripped into each other on Brexit and the merits of a No Deal.In a bitter exchange, self-styled Brexit hardman Dominic Raab accused Michael Gove of “buckling” by saying he would accept another delay beyond October . He said: “You would buckle because you’ve shown you would take another extension”.Mr Gove hit back by slamming his supporter in the  leadetory rship contest for threatening to suspend or prorogue Parliament altogether to force through a No Deal.Shock leadership candidate Rory Stewart piled in by saying the idea of suspending Parliament was “undemocratic” and “deeply disturbing”.And he mocked his rivals for engaging in a competition of machismo over leaving the EU.But Mr Raab compared the Aid Secretary to Venezuelan socialist dictator Maduro for suggesting he thrash out Brexit with a “citizens assembly” beloved by the left.In another personal barb, Mr Javid – the son a Pakistani immigrant bus driver – launched into the privileged background of his rival candidates.He said: “As well as having the right message, we need to have the right messenger. We need to be a party that has a broad appeal across the country and that means having a messenger that can connect broadly with the whole electorate.”Hitting out at Eton-educated Mr Stewart, he added: “I think I’m the only one on this stage to have gone to a comprehensive school. I went to a college, a further education college - not the sort of college Rory went to.”The debate came  hours before the second round of voting in the contest – and a second debate scheduled for later that evening on the BBC which Mr Johnson has agreed to take part in.Mr Stewart won over the audience with a free-wheeling performance where he once more positioned himself as an outsider.He spoke movingly of an -year-old constituent forced to care for her  year-old incontinent husband because of the country’s social care crisis as he said there were “,” things a new Prime Minister had to tackle.And he won laughter when he once more compared delivering Brexit to the near-impossible task of “cramming a whole series of rubbish bins” into a larger bin against his we’s advice. He said he wanted to say “believe in the bin, believe in Britain” but knew better.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit Secretary, insisted none of his rivals would get a Brexit deal with the European Union unless they were willing to play hard ball with Brussels. Mr Gove repeated his campaign message that he proved he could deliver against the odds and was “ready to unite, ready to lead”.He opened his pitch by saying: “When Jeremy Corbyn wakes up on a Wednesday morning before Prime Minister’s Questions, who is the person he’s going to be most terried of facing  That’s me.”After struggling early on, Jeremy Hunt said the Government had to appeal to the centre groundit wanted to win a majority.And he warned that while the Tories had been disagreeing over whether to pick a Norwegian or Canadian style Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn had been planning for a Venezuelan or Cuban Britain.After butting heads for more than an hour, the Tory colleagues appeared to try to come back together towards the end of the debate.Mr Hunt launched a passionate defence of Mr Gove over his cocaine shame when the Environment Secretary was challenged whether he could be trusted. Mr Hunt stormed: “When we face a constitutional crisis of the magnitude of Brexit we should not be trivialising the debate by talking about what we did  years ago.”He is on course to win the leadership election, even more so after securing the backing of Cabinet star Matt Hancock.Now is a perfect time for him to set out his policy agenda, his vision for Britain and his plan for how to deliver Brexit in the teeth of a Remainer Parliament.He wants us to take him seriously.

making sure that we amend the system or revise the system so its as sensitive as it possibly can be to the changing and fluid needs of those who are struggling.Id also want to incentivise the system so that weve got as much encouragement for people to go out and work and marginal rates of taxation are as low as possible.And Michael Gove told the hustings: There are specic issues that relate to the interaction between Universal Credit and income tax which mean that for the working poor we may need to do more and I am eager to do better.Jeremy Hunt refused to make any specic policy pledges but said: Id always be ready to review the way Universal Credit is being rolled out to make sure we do it in the fairest possible way.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront -

In  they took their two children Jameson, , and Evelyn, , out of public school , sold all their possessions and bought the caravan.Between  and  the family toured Alaska, Canada, New Zealand, Vanuatu, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hong Kong and Australia.  Joanna and Oliver decided in  that leaving their children at school for six hours a day, five days a week was far too long and they no longer wanted to live within societies guidelines and decided to travel together.The family sold their home they had owned since January . Oliver sold his business as an electrician, they bought a WD and a caravan and in January  they set off on an amazing journey around the world. Since then they have travelled along the East coast of Australia and since March, theyaposve been road-tripping across America and Canada.    Despite money being a problem and their kids missing their friends they have no intention of ever stopping. In January  my husband and I decided that work five or six days a week to pay a mortgage and sending our kids away from us for education was not sitting well with us, Joanna said. We only get a few short years with our kids and it felt like the time was slipping through our fingers. So, we decided to apostime outapos from the le society had dictated to us.  We always put aside time to travel, over the past five years we have been to, Alaska, Canada, New Zealand, Vanuatu, Europe, Hong Kong and travelled dferent parts of Australia.So, we sold our family home and Oliver gave up his business as an electrician which weaposd spent eight years building. We pulled our kids out of school, bought a WD and a caravan and set off on the adventure of a letime. Since we set off full time in January we have travelled along the east coast of Australia from Melbourne to Brisbane. Then since March we have been road-tripping across America and Canada.  Our absolute highlights have been New York City, Alberta in Canada and without a doubt our slow travel down the Pacic North West Coast.Of course the real highlights are very simple - spending every day with each other, no getting up early for work, no prepping for school, no after school activities or weekend madness. Joanna has had to adapt to being a teacher as well as a mother, which has been challenging at times. Both children are enrolled at an online school in Australia where they have regular contact with their own teachers. Although the two siblings get along very well, they sometimes miss their friends, but they have also made lots of new ones on the road.  Throughout their travels the family have seen their savings dip without a pay cheque which has taken some adjusting to. In November they willto their hometown where Joanna will work the peak period in the local book shop and Oliver will find the odd electricianaposs jobs.They plan to do this every year, so they can continue to travel for  months a year. Itaposs been hard getting the mindset of being aposteacherapos to our kids. Both are enrolled into an online school in Australia that are designed for long distance learners. Our children have classes three mornings a week. They have their own teachers who mark their own work and write reports on their progress, Joanna said.  Jameson and Evelyn get along very well, and we love being around them. Typically, they miss their friends especially Jameson, but they manage to make friends wherever they go. Australia is full of travelling families, so I know theyaposll be ok. Watching the savings account go down with no money coming in has taken some adjusting to. Because we want to continue travelling, we have decided to work two months a year. So in November Iaposll go back to work at the local book store in our hometown and Oliver will find electrician work. Itaposs incredibly cheap to travel in this way and we can easily get by on per week. We often get to camp freely and enjoy free activities like hiking and surfing. Itaposs very easy to not spend money.To be honest we canapost see ourselves ever ing to a typical lestyle again. We canapost wait for our big Australian lap tour over two years and then we want to go back to Europe. Some of our family come from the generation where work and money are the number one priority and understandably, they had their concerns. Over time though theyaposve seen how the le we are giving our kids is absolutely priceless.On a final note itaposs important to take hold of your le. You donapost have to own a house and you do not need to have a fancy car. Money doesnapost equal happiness. Our children are with us for such a short time in this le. Go out and live your best le possible with them.

But it took a dferent tone when Ms Barnett asked about a privacy judgement from  that revealed that Mr Johnson had a child out of wedlock with a woman who was not his we. The childaposs family sought an injunction to stop the father being named - but lost as judges ruled that the public had a right to know about Mr Johnsonaposs behavior as then Mayor of London. The radio show host started by asking Mr Mercer how many children he had. I have two, Mr Mercer replied. Emma Barner said: Well I have one.    Weaposve both put out our number of children. How many children does Boris Johnson have  An audibly floundering Mr Mercer replied: Iaposm really not interested in Boris Johnsonaposs family le. Ms Barnett pressed on, explaining in detail about why she thought the question was important. The radio host said: Because right nowyou google aposBoris Johnson, how many children does he haveapos - and Iaposll explain why I am asking this - it comes up as four. That is with his still we, but now separated, Marina Wheeler. But there was a court case in  where a woman lost a privacy case. The Judge said it was in the public interest while he was in office that he had an extramarital affair with a woman who later gave birth to a daughter while he was married. It then came out in that court case that it was alleged he had another child out of wedlock. So it is between five and six children that our future Prime Minister has. Would you not say it is fair and right to get an answer to the question of how many children our next Prime Minister has  Mr Mercer replied: Discussing our private lives is a decision that public figures like me make.    I have chosen to discuss mine, Boris has not chosen not to discuss his and he is well within his rights to do that. Ms Barnett asked again - saying: The Master of the Rolls, in that case, said it was a apospublic interest matter which the electorate was entitled to know when considering his fitness for high public office. This is not my Mary Whitehouse moment, this is me asking you then a dferent question - why do you think he has chosen not to be honest about something as basic as how many children he has  Mr Mercer replied: What Boris chooses to do in his personal le and what he chooses to talk about is entirely a matter for him. It would be entirely inappropriate for me to talk about any of that. Boris Johnson is currently orcing his we Marina Wheeler.    The couple, who married in , have four children together - Lara, Milo Arthur, Cassia Peaches, and Theodore Apollo. The case mentioned by Ms Barnett revolved around his fth child with art consultant Helen Macintyre. The court decided that Mr Johnsonaposs identity as the father of her daughter Stephanie could be made public. Ms Barnett referenced a potential sixth child mentioned in court documents. No sixth child of Mr Johnson has ever been publicly acknowledged. The references in the judgement, which states this is the second time that he hascaused a woman who was not his we to become pregnant, may refer to the pregnancy terminated by another former lover of the Mr Johnson, Petronella Wyatt. Mr Johnsonaposs spokesperson declined to comment.

The MP for Walthamstow in London, who is expecting her first child, had asked for extra funding for staff and more support. She decided to speak out after experiencing two miscarriages during which she was forced to continue to work as normal. “Heartbroken by all the years that I have struggled with fertility, I’ve kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected,” she writes.“Now I’m pregnant once more and terried – not just that it will go wrong again, but because I know that my resolve to keep my private and professional lives separate has become impossible.” Writing in thethe campaigning MP explained how during her first miscarriage she was forced to keep working while “aching and bleeding”, including joining a protest for the extradition of a man who had raped and murdered a constituent. After her second miscarriage she said she had to arrange the medical procedure around constituency advice surgeries. Ms Creasy says the way that the parliamentary authorities deal with pregnancy is not fair. “Humiliatingly, it is making me beg for extra staff funding – or give up any chance of spending time with my child to make sure my constituents don’t miss out,” she writes. “If a GP or vicar were on leave, a locum would be provided to ensure continuity of services. In Denmark, a member of the national parliament would have a substitute MP appointed.” Earlier this year proxy voting was introduced for MPs after fellow Labour MP Tulip Siddiq was forced to delay her cesarean and travel through the voting lobbies in a wheelchair to have her say on a key Brexit vote.Ms Siddiq, who gave birth to her second child this year, said she didnapost even ask the authorities for extra help because she had such a negative reaction first time around. She explained to the : I was told ‘we have not got a historic policy on that because we have not had many women in parliament who give birth’,” she said. The Hampstead and Kilburn MP said that proxy voting had make things much easier but that in many ways it was hard for others to step in and cover the job of an MP. She said she responded to emails from hospital but was helped by neighbouring MP Keir Starmer when it came to attending events. “He helped because we unofficially paired up, but that was the goodness of his heart. If you share a borough with an opposition MP, they wouldn’t do it,” she said.

All of them, that is, except chicken Boris Johnson.Once again the blonde-haired Brexiteer blushed his way out of hard questions from Westminster journalists. It was a full on-the-record debate, and it only didnapost appear on TV because Parliamentary authorities said no. Yet shy and retiring Mr Johnson will only face a BBC TV debate tomorrow night, after at least one of his rivals has been knocked out of the contest. Even without the  -odds frontrunner, however, we did learn some valuable things from todayaposs lobby hustings. From their views on Universal Credit to whether or not they were in MI, here are  things we learned. Boris Johnson did not attend the hustings because - weaposre told - he had to prepare for tomorrowaposs debate.It was the second event heaposd shamelessly boycotted in two days, having been empty-podiumed by Channel  last night.Michael Gove sniped: Someone put it to me that these hustings without Boris was like Hamlet without the prince.Of course we all remember that at the end of Hamlet he isnapost the king. Now Iaposm not suggesting that that means we should go for a Norway option. But I do think itaposs the case that it ainapost over until itaposs over.But Jeremy Hunt, who could soon be asking for a job in a Johnson government, was less keen to slag him off.He shrugged everyone makes mistakes when asked about Boris Johnsonaposs comments about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe. The then-Foreign Secretary is accused of ening the British mumaposs jail term in Iran after he incorrectly told MPs she had been training journalists. Yet Mr Hunt said: Everyone makes mistakes as Foreign Secretary. You are constantly making very finely balanced judgements and it is possible to get things wrong and Iaposm sure Iaposll get things wrong in the future as well. . Jeremy Hunt BACKED Trumpaposs attack on Londonaposs mayor   Jeremy Hunt BACKED Donald Trump over a series of attacks on Sadiq Khan - despite them being branded racist.The Foreign Secretary said he agreed % with the sentiment behind the US Presidentaposs attack on Londonaposs mayor - despite the attack including the word Londonistan. Asked directly about the word aposLondonistanapos, Mr Hunt admitted I wouldn’t use those words myself but did not explicitly condemn the phrase. He added: The sentiment is enormous disappointment that we have a Mayor of London who has completely failed to tackle kne crime and spent more time on politics than the actual business of making Londoners safer. “And in that, I % agree with the President.”His comment comes despite three of his Tory rivals, Sajid Javid, Michael Gove and Dominic Raab, all slamming the President.  Rory Stewart added I feel very strongly that you should be firm with world leaders, but that discussions of this kind should happen privately.. Meanwhile, the next PM offers little hope for Northern Ireland abortion campaigners...  A major issue has been whether the UK government steps in and legalises abortion in Northern Ireland.Dominic Raab said he believes passionately in a woman’s right to choose, wants to avoid unwanted pregnancies.But he said he would not extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland, because he doesn’t want to risk destroying the constitutional framework of the UK.Jeremy Hunt did not commit to changing the law either.He has previously repeated his long-held beliefs that the time limit should be reduced from  to  weeks but said that he had no plans to change the law as it stands. On Northern Ireland he said only that he had provided funding for women in Northern Ireland to access abortions as health secretary. The other candidates were not asked but have so far given no indication. ... Or Universal Credit claimants  None of the candidates who were asked committed to a major overhaul of Universal Credit.Jeremy Hunt refused to saythe rollout of Universal Credit has pushed people to food banks - and signalled he wouldnapost halt the rollout.He told the Mirror Universal Credit is the right way forward adding: Youaposve always got to be compassionate and humane when you look at the way these reforms are being rolled out. Iaposd always be willing to look at that, to review the way Universal Credit is being rolled out to make sure we do it in the fairest possible way. But the principle is right.Sajid Javid suggested he wouldnapost change the five-week wait for first payment - saying he wouldnapost make fundamental changes, despite wanting more fairness and dignity.He added registering should be faster and the appeals process overhauled.Michael Gove also refused to say he would shorten the five-week wait for first payment. Askedhe would, he said: I donapost think radical changes but there are changes that need to be made.I think Amber Rudd has done a fantastic job of at Work and Pensions in order to deal with some of the teething problems with Universal Credit. There are some specic problems that relate to the interaction between Universal Credit and income tax which mean that for the working poor we may need to do more and Iaposm eager to do that.Dominic Raab did not commit to shortening the five-week wait either. He said: We need to make sure welfare is a safety net, but also a route out of the welfare trap.Need to make sure we can amend the system and revise the system so it is as sensitive as it needs to be for those who are struggling. . But thereaposs some hope for free TV licences Jeremy Hunt became the second surviving leadership hopeful to pledge a U-turn - and keep free TV licences for over-s.It comes after the BBC announced it would restrict the benefit to only the poorest OAPs on Pension Credit. The decision is set to take away .million householdsapos free TV licence from summer next year. Campaigners say the Tories should never have foisted the decision onto the BBC. The benefit was once managed by the state - and in  the Tories pledged to keep free licences for the over-s.Today, askedhe would honour that pledge, Mr Hunt told the Mirror: Yes. He joins Sajid Javid, whose spokeswoman said he would “commit to keeping” free TV licences.. There were some eye-popping attacks on Jeremy Corbyn   Jeremy Hunt said Jeremy Corbyn is against aspiration, he is against British values, he is against Britain. But itaposs Michael Gove who saved up the biggest attack. He said: I have fire in my belly. But more than that Jeremy Corbyn cannot [help] how he was born. He cannot help the accident of his birth. He cannot help that he was born into the purple of middle class.I would fight against Jeremy Corbyn and his Wykehamist educated allies to make sure that the poorest people in this country have a government that is on their side. The only way you can do that is by having someone like me, who is a warrior for the dispossessed, rather than someone like Jeremy Corbyn, who is, how can I put it …more comfortable making the case for Iran than he is for Britain’s working classes. . And furious mixed views on John Bercow In an appeal to MPs who accuse him of anti-Brexit bias, Jeremy Hunt launched a blistering attack on John Bercow.He said Mr Bercow would have “mixed record” and also be remembered as a “reforming” Speaker of the Commons. However, he added: “I profoundly disagree with the way he has used his office to further a particular political agenda. “I think the Speaker has to be impartial and that means recognising the government has a voice in Parliament, not just the opposition.”Yet Michael Gove defended the Speaker with an unusual excuse. He said: John and I have children at the same school so I wonapost speak ill of my good friend John Bercow.. They donapost like talking about their past acts Asked whether he had taken any drugs other than cocaine, Michael Gove replied: “I’ve answered all the questions about that when I was interviewed by Andrew Marr and also when I spoke to the Daily Mail. That was a full and complete statement.” Jeremy Hunt was asked whether he regretted likening the EU to the USSR in a speech at the Tory Party conference last year, saying: I think it showed Iaposm prepared to say things to friends they might not like and able to continue a relationship even saying those uncomfortable things. Dominic Raab was confronted with accusations that his version of events of meetings as Brexit Secretary was completely at odds with accounts from Brussels and the Irish government.To which he responded: Of course people in Brussels because in their own words I said to them things no one  dared to. . But they do all *claim* to have a plan for Brexit... All the candidates re-stated their plan for Brexit.Michael Gove - who wants to renegotiate the backstop and turbo-change tech arrangements for the Irish border - admitted it was a mistake to trigger Article  before having a plan for Brexit, and said he urged then-PM Theresa May to take a dferent course. Jeremy Hunt said he said he would go back to Brussels to try and renegotiate the existing Brexit deal. He claimedhe came with new ideas, a new PM, a fresh approach, the EU would be willing to be flexible. He didnapost rule out No Deal. Rory Stewart said heaposd try to pass Theresa Mayaposs three-times-defeated Brexit deal, approaching Labour MPs including Lisa Nandy. If that failed heaposd set up a aposCitizensapos Assemblyapos - with EU Brexit negotiator Barnier called to give evidence on the art of the possible. Dominic Raab insisted he would continue to pursue the Malthouse Compromise Brexit plan - for a renegotiated Northern Ireland backstop and a new transition period - and leave with No Dealneeded. Sajid Javid insisted Britain would still be the safest country in the world in a No Deal Brexit but said he would try to negotiate a better deal.... And it could involve summoning Michel Barnier to persuade Britain. And  Tory MPs voting against No Deal. Tory candidate Rory Stewart would work with Labour MPs and Michel Barnier to stop a hard Brexit, he declared. The leadership hopeful confirmed heaposd approach Labour MPs including Lisa Nandy in a bid to pass Theresa Mayaposs three-times-failed Brexit deal.If that failed heaposd set up a aposCitizensapos Assemblyapos on the way forward - with EU Brexit negotiator Barnier called to give evidence on the art of the possible.He also suggested up to  Tory MP colleagues would block No Deal Brexit through a vote without needing to bring down the government.. Rory Stewart is not a fuzzy Remainer lefty With his quirky manner and pronouncements against Brexit, you could be forgiven for thinking Rory Stewart is some kind of anti-Brexit left-wing zealot.But our questioning showed that image simply isnapost true. He refused to call an early general election, branding the idea catastrophic and dumb. The same went for a second referendum which he said would be isive,The Old Etonian has in fact slammed rivals for offering to spend too much on services like schools and police.And asked about his loyal Tory voting record, and whether he was being dishonest, he said: I’ve said from the very beginning I’m never going to spend any money I donapost have. I am a Conservative, I’m very proud of being a Conservative. I believe deeply in limited government, inidual rights, restraint abroad and prudence at home. . He also DENIES he worked for MI A former diplomat who walked across Afghanistan, Rory Stewart has previously admitted his career gives the impression he was a spy.He cemented that today, saying he doesnapost trust even his fellow Tory MPs in the voting lobbies. And to cap it all, askedhe had ever worked for MI, he replied with one word: No. Exactly what an MI agent WOULD say! . Despite everything, Michael Gove is looking forward to David Cameronaposs book Only yesterday Michael Gove admitted heaposd lost friends over his backing for Brexit. He was, of course, talking about David Cameron.But despite everything, Mr Gove said heaposs looking forward to former Prime Ministeraposs memoirs later this year. Askedhe fears the book he said: No, I’m looking forward to reading it. I think it will be brilliantly written. I think it’s been too long since we’ve heard from David in many ways. I think he was a great Prime Minister.

The standard waiting time was cut from six weeks to five, advance loans were increased and better run-on payments introduced to stop people falling behind on rent.

Concerns have been raised over blue drinking water at Buchanan High in Coatbridge, in North Lanarkshire, Scotland and a number of teachers have been diagnosed with cancer. Josie Morgan’s -year-old son Tommi, who has autism, is a first-year pupil at the school and has been blind since October - after suddenly developing an ulcer on his right cornea which has robbed him of his vision. Josie said medical tests have showed Tommi has three times the normal levels of arsenic in his system and the poor youngster is angry and frustrated after losing his sight.    She is demanding to know more about the likelihood of ground contamination at the school, which is built on a former industrial site. She will be meeting NHS Lanarkshire officials next week and her case has been referenced at the Scottish Parliament by constituency MSP Alex Neil. Josie said: “Tommi’s vision was perfect before he started high school but he then took an ulcer which saw his eyesight deteriorate over the space of two weeks, and by early October he was totally blind. “We couldn’t work out what had happened and consultants were baffled as scans were coming back normal. “In February, I found out about what was happening with the water and made the doctors aware of it. Tommi was sent for new tests and it was found that his arsenic levels, which should be , were at .” She added: “I believe there’s a link. Arsenic doesn’t appear in a person’s system for no reason. We need to know where it has come from and to be able to pinpoint the source of this.    “I have a meeting with public health officials next week and have spoken to a lawyer, lots of councillors, and Alex Neil, who I can’t praise enough for his backing.” Josie told how a public meeting with officials from North Lanarkshire Council which is responsible for the school failed to shed any light on her concerns. She said: “The officials spoke most of the time and just repeated the same things. They’re adamant the school is safe but nobody got any answers and it didn’t fill us with any confidence. “I took the microphone and spoke about Tommi. I don’t know how I managed to do it but I told everybody what had happened to him and people were absolutely horried. “Now I want an independent inquiry, and everybody at the meeting was of the same opinion. We’re concerned about every child in the school and the fact that four teachers have cancer. It’s a flagship building and it’s a brilliant school – but there’s no use in it being brilliantit’s unsafe.” Josie says her son is a completely dferent wee laddie since losing his sight..  She said: “He had some tests three weeks ago and depending on how they come back, there’s a small chance he could be put on steroids and recover a little bit of vision, but they’re telling me it’s likely he’s not going to recover his sight. “Tommi is angry and frustrated. He’s been taken away from school, he can’t play games, there’s nothing he can do and his mental health has suffered as he’s missing his friends, school and routine, which is important with autism. “He’s known his school friends since they were in primary together – it took years to build relationships and he wouldn’t consider being sent to another school.” A spokesman for North Lanarkshire Council said: Specialist doctors from the public health department of NHS Lanarkshire have confirmed that there is no evidence to link attendance at the schools with an increased risk of cancer. They have also confirmed that no other serious illness is connected to attendance at the schools or the site on which they are built.“All the facts from all the lead organisations continue to confirm that the schools and the site on which they are built are safe.

Thomas McKell, from Glagsow, Scotland, made the desperate request because the MRSA bug that had eaten the skin and muscle behind his knee could not be treated.The former joiner, who has multiple sclerosis, is now unable to move his legs and is stuck in a foetal position in hospital, the Daily Record reports.Thomas, who has been fighting MRSA for the last four years, and his mum Pauline, , shared shocking pictures of him in hospital in a bid to get help for him. She said: “At one point, it was so bad, he said he wanted them to amputate his legs.”    “Thomas is severely disabled with MS and we just don’t know where to turn to. “We have been shoved from pillar to post and things just seem to get worse. He’s such a poor soul. “He was diagnosed with MS in his s. He used to be fit and active.He loved football and supported  Celtic  and even went to see them in Seville. He used to work as a joiner and was always on the go.“For four years, they have been cleaning the wound on his leg but it never seems to get any better. “It’s heartbreaking. We’re now told he has a category four MRSA wound. He is in a terrible state and even the plastic surgeon was shocked when he saw it. We just don’t know what to do for him.    “Surely someone shouldn’t just be left like this in this day and age ” Dad-of-two Thomas, , is stuck in the foetal position because of muscle wastage causing his legs to retract. He may have to have the tendons cut in his legs to allow them to be straightened. Health chiefs insist he is getting the right treatment and they promised to meet his family to discuss his care. But Pauline is appalled by his physical and mental state.    Thomas was treated in Glasgow Royal Infirmary but is now a patient in the city’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. Pauline, who also has MS, said they are still waiting for test results on his leg wound. Her comments on Thomas’s plight come after a Scottish hospital was investigated over the care of a multiple sclerosis patient stuck in the foetal position for more than two years. Former reservist soldier Billy Barclay, , was moved from Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride – where he had been trapped because a care home place couldn’t be found. His daughter Barbara said he received much better care at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. But staff there discovered he had two fractures and a serious infection. Social workers issued Hairmyres with an adult protection order over his care in .    “They are now talking about taking skin off his thighs to graft onto the wound. It is just one thing after another and everything seems to take so long to happen. Why does it have to be like that  “I am disgusted. He just needs help.” Labour and Co-operative MP for Glasgow North East Paul Sweeney is backing the family. He said: “These pictures of Thomas are extremely distressing and I can only imagine how his family feel looking on helplessly as he suffers. This comes amid ongoing questions about a chronic lack of resources and understaffing at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. “Whatever has happened up to this point it is important that the McKell family are given assurances that someone has taken ownership of Thomas’s future care and I will support them in ensuring that happens. A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: “We are sorry to hear that this woman is unhappy with her son’s care. “We would like to reassure her that he is receiving the appropriate medical treatment and nursing care. “We are arranging to meet with this patient’s family to ensure they are kept informed about all aspects of his care and are given the opportunity to discuss any concerns they have.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first photo beautiful woman 24","story":"NewsFirst photo of beautul woman, , found dead at new homeEyelash beautician Ella Emery moved into the property in Longwood, Huddersfield, about a month ago with her partner, according to neighboursShareCommentsByRobert SutclfeAmber Hicks:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsElla Emery died shortly after police were called to a report of a concern for safety \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA beautul -year-old found dead at the home she had recently moved into with her partner has been pictured as pals pay tribute.

The clip, which was taken at a park in Aveley, Essex, shows at least four other young girls dragging the victim to the ground, kicking her and pulling her hair. Loud screaming and laughing can be heard as the girl desperately tries to cover her face and protect herself. The mum of the victim has revealed her daughter has ADHD, and says she believes parents have had discipline “powers taken away from them,” following the disgusting attack.  The June  attack on Laura Wigg’s daughter Keisha went viral within hours of being posted. The -year-old was captured being punched in the head at Belhus Park. Laura, , says she found the footage “disgusting” and has decided to share her daughter’s story in an attempt to change the way children are prosecuted when they commit assaults. The clip shows Keisha, who has ADHD, being kicked whilst lying on the ground, including on the head. A girl in a grey top can be seen standing opposite a girl wearing all black and begins to slap her in the face and punch her in the stomach. The girl in black then walks away from her attacker appearing to try and get away from the situation. The footage then shows three girls surround her before one of them lunges at her and soon three girls are punching the victim repeatedly.    Another girl then arrives on the scene to join in on the attack as the helpless girl is dragged to the ground. The video then shows Keisha being kicked whilst lying on the ground, including in the head. She then sits up as the other girls continue to slap her on the head. One of them can be seen pulling her hair as “someone punch her in the face” can be heard before the clip ends.    Speaking today, Laura explained the dferent emotions sheaposs been through following the incident. She said: “One minute I’m upset, the next minute I’m angry, the next I want to go smash something. “I think they [police] will just give them a warning, which is not good enough.” “If it was an adult involved we would be held accountable, it’s disgusting.” Adult support worker Laura went on to describe how she feels parents are unable to properly discipline their children and described what she would have donethe tables were turned. She added: “If it was my child who had done what they did to Keisha, I would have told the girl to punch my daughter in the face.    “They have taken away our responsibilities as parents by not letting us discipline our children “I used to be smacked as a child and it didn’t do me any harm. “But then again, they’re the ones sending their kids off with fancy phones etc. It’s a catch  situation, you can’t win. “Something needs to change. What would have happenedthey had killed her  It’s not asthey had kicked her in the legs. What in case she ends up having a brain problem, it’s lucky they didn’t blind her.” However, after initially been wary about the video being in the public domain, Laura says Keisha is glad to see it’s had a positive reaction. She said: “I told her ‘you could go on to be an advocate for young people about this. “The rapper Jay One met her and gave her a ticket to go see him.    “I’m overwhelmed with the with all the lovely responses, someone even set up a gofundme page.” Essex Police confirmed they are treating the incident as an assault.

Plans for the German coupleaposs next adventure have caused a stir however. Catalin and Elena want to cycle on a tandem bike from their home country to Africa in July.    Because neither of them have a job - instead relying on Catalinaposs mother to fund their lestyle by working two jobs - they have turned to the public for financial support.On a GoFundMe page they have set their sights high, asking for €,to embark on the trip.According to Catalin and Elena the adventure is worthy of external funding because of the positive impact it would have on their Instagram followers. We could write a long text about mental health or global warming, they explain on the fundraising page. We could tell you about following your dreams, or how important stepping out of your comfort zone is.    We could tell you how beautul traveling is, and it’s benefits, or the fact that most news don’t match reality. But we’re going to show you! Less talking more action. While the pair are undeniably busy when it comes to going on holidays and posting photos on social media, their activeness seems questionable when it comes to the job market. They have said getting a job would be detrimental to their lestyle.    Some will just tell us to get jobs, like everyone  and stop begging. But when you have the impact we do on othersapos le, getting a job is not an option, they wrote. We could model and make fast money, but we donapost want to advertise consumerism. A normal job at this point would be detrimental. So far they have raised €through six donors for their huge adventure. They have also stirred up a huge amount of resentment amongst those who object to their unusual means of money making.    One woman wrote on the page: Heres an idea - how about you get jobsand fund it yourselves  You could even gt some of the money you make to those less fortunate than you.. Another added: Allowing your mother to work two jobs so you donapost have to work one  How do you sleep  How do you move under that mountain of shame. Some people use this  for le saving reasons, you could be taking money from someone who needs it to live through to next week. This is vapid, fake and everything wrong with the world.    The coupleaposs rise to moderate internet stardom is possibly due to their striking appearances. Catalin is heavily tattooed, with English phrases including aposFreedomapos, aposI Love Leapos and aposLook withinapos scrawled over drawings of an angel and a crown. By contrast Elena is largely tattoo free. Following on from a torrid day online on which thousands of people left comments critical of the couple, Catalin posted a close up photo of his eye with the caption: LOOK WITHIN. And with this post, I will step away from social media for a little while. I mentioned that Iaposll be doing the hardest thing Iaposve ever done mentally and physically, soon.    Here it is. I am going on a walk. I will walk as long as I possibly can. No sleep, No social media, No distractions. Just me and my brain out there. This first came to my mind in the Himalayan mountains, where I got to experience what my mind, body and soul are capable of. Now Iaposm going to take it even further.  I am ready to face whatever is buried deep inside me. Those doing the  day challenge, carry on. Remember why you started and keep moving forward.

The Duchess of Cambridge was all smiles as she chatted with Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, Queen Letizia of Spain, the Duchess of Cornwall and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands while attending the annual Order of the Garter Service. The -year-old looked elegant in a Catherine Walker aposLizaapos white coat dress featuring black lace and teamed it with a black Lock  Co hat and black clutch. The event, held at St Georgeaposs Chapel, was met with glorious sunshine while the streets were filled with hundreds of onlookers keen to catch a glimpse of the VIP visitors.  The afternoon began with pomp and pageantry as the band and the Household Cavalry marched the streets. Wearing the lavish velvet robes, glistening insignia and plumed hats of the Order of the Garter, the Queen and the royal knights processed through the grounds of Windsor Castle. The annual service, a -year-old tradition, is the oldest and most senior Order of Chivalry in Britain. Recipients of the honour of joining the order are chosen because they have held public office, contributed to national le or served the sovereign personally.  The appointment of Knights of the Garter is in the Queenaposs gt and is made without consulting ministers. King Felipe VI of Spain and King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands were among those to receive a special honour and were installed as Supernumerary, or aposStrangerapos, Knights of the Garter. The pair proudly walked to St Georgeaposs Chapel with the Prince of Wales, Duke of Cambridge, Duke of York, Princess Royal and Earl of Wessex. They were watched by the Duchess of Cambridge, Duchess of Cornwall, Countess of Wessex and the two foreign Queens - the Spanish monarchaposs we Queen Letizia, and Queen Maxima, we of the Dutch king. The tradition honours those who have been knighted in recognition of their public service and was founded by Edward III in .  He was inspired by the tales of King Arthur and the chivalric Knights of the Round Table. The Knights, now both male and female, used to be limited to aristocracy, but today they are chosen from a iety of backgrounds, in recognition for their public service. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, a past president of the Supreme Court, and Admiral Lord Boyce, a former head of the UKaposs armed forces are also Garter knights and were part of the procession in front of the royals. Their route was lined by troopers on foot from the Household Cavalryaposs Le Guards and Blues and Royals, wearing their plumed helmets and carrying swords.  The Queen, who arrived by state limousine, wore the grand traditional mantle and hat of the Order. The dark blue velvet mantle is embroidered with the Order of the Garter insignia and has a dark red sash attached to the right shoulder. It has been worn by members since the th century. She also wore a black velvet Tudor style bonnet, with a plume of white ostrich and heron feathers and the shield of St Georgeaposs cross. She teamed it with a Stewart Parvin gown in ivory, rose and gold.  Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, opted for a pale pink Anna Valentine dress coat and Philip Treacy hat, while Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, stunned in a white and coral Suzannah dress with Jane Taylor hat. Queen Maxima wore an outfit by Claes Iversen and a hat by Fabienne Delvigne.

Cinema attendant Leanne Robson turned up at the manaposs workplace and gave the A sized image to his manager whilst the victim, a security guard watched the meeting unfold on CCTV, a court heard. The boss did not look at the image as the picture was folded over but enraged Robson allegedly threatened to the share the same explicit image of her former partner - taken during the coupleaposs relationship - at his childrenaposs school. She is also said to have kicked the -year old victim down a flight of stairs during another confrontation at the Red Rock leisure complex where they both worked in Stockport, Greater Manchester and would repeatedly turn up at his office demanding to speak to him.  During his ordeal the unnamed victim even ly claimed his mother had died in an attempt to stop Robson pestering him before eventually quitting his job following the revenge porn attack. At Stockport magistrates court, Robson, from the Brinnington area of the town was convicted of disclosing a private picture with intent to cause distress and assault by beating. The  year old admitted a further offence of common assault. Offences of disclosing private sexual photographs and films carry a maximum sentence of two years in jail. The court heard the couple had begun a romance in March last year after meeting at work but the affair fizzled out the following September amid allegations he owed her money. The first incident occurred the following month when the guard was on patrol with his supervisor when he was attacked by Robson as she emerged from the cinema. He told the hearing: She was slapping, kicking, punching and swearing - calling me a horrible b*****d and saying she was going to get me killed.  In the November I got a radio call that I had a visitor at the office, and as soon a so got up there I saw it was Leanne. I walked away down the stairs but she came after me and started attacking me, swearing and shouting and punching me to the back of the head twice. She was saying she was going to get me battered and get me killed when I finished work and she tried to kick me down the stairs. She put her foot at the bottom of my back and she pushed. I just went down a couple of steps and carried on walking but a couple of members of the public were telling her to calm down. She kept coming down to the office and it was disrupting my work. He added: On January  I was watching the CCTV when I saw Leanne approach the building with her daughter. She came to the office and was knocking on the door and windows and one of my managers was in the gym downstairs and he came out and he started talking to her. He brought them up to seeI wanted to talk to them but I told him I didnapost want to. Then I saw Leanne hand my manager a piece of paper and he came back into the office. It was an A piece of paper folded twice. I knew what it was as she told me she was going to do it. She told me in ious text messages in the weeks leading up to the incident. It was going to be an explicit picture I sent to Leanne whilst we were together.  She also took one of me whilst we were together. He came into the office and he said: Leanne asked me to give you this. I said: I already know what it is. I opened it and it was what I thought it was going to be. I said: youaposve not opened it have you  And he said: no, I donapost want to. It was a naked full body picture. The first thing I saw was the full body picture. She did tell me she was going to put them all over my childrenaposs school. It was a private picture sheaposs got no reason to give it to anyone. Why would she give it to anyone  I opened it then closed it and put it in a drawer then I phoned the police and gave it to the police. I think she was trying to embarrass me and trying to get me sacked from my job. She told me she was going to get me sacked. If she did me money, it got paid back to her. She bought me new trainers for my birthday and a silver jacket as well. I told her my mother had died as I just wanted away from her - even though my motheraposs not dead. She kept telling me she wanted money off me even though I didnapost owe her any money. Sheaposs making it up about me owing her money.  Robson did not give evidence at the hearing. But her lawyer Kai Luckham said: There are grounds to say the complainants evidence was not consistent. He said there was threats to make these pictures available across schools - but no such evidence has been provided. The complainant owed money to my client and she was seeking to persuade him to give it back. He was the victim of assault, which she has admitted to, when she was taunted, when she was laughed at. She lost her temper and she accepts that. She is mortied by her own behaviour. The whole issue is about money.

The terried schoolgirl held on to the top of her trousers and he gave up trying to force them down. He released the girl who went back to her parents and told them what had happened. Jim Robertson prosecuting, said the primary school pupil’s parents described her as being “upset” with a “shocked look” on her face.  When they asked her what had happened, Mr Robertson said, she told them the man had tried to pull down her trousers and she’d held them up. Askedshe had tried to scream she said she hadn’t because she was “too scared”. He added: “She said the man let her out by unlocking the door and told her to wash her hands.” He said the girl was able to give police a description of Beattie and the distinctive yellow bag he was carrying. Officers viewed CCTV footage from the restaurant in Livingston, West Lothian and subsequently identied and traced him. They searched his bag at Livingston Police Station and found a multi-tool lock-kne with a mm serrated blade, a pair of latex gloves, and a bottle of lubricant. Beattie pleaded guilty to placing the girl in a state of fear and alarm by pushing her into the cubicle, locking the door, exposing himself to her and trying to lower her trousers on February , . He also pleaded guilty to following a woman into the female toilets at the restaurant on January , entering the middle cubicle next to hers and watching her as she used the toilet.Mr Robertson said the woman heard a noise from the neighbouring cubicle and looked up to see Beattie peering over the top of the partition. He said: “She was furious. She was upset. She began to shout and swear at the accused.“She ran out of the cubicle and saw him run into the first cubicle and lock himself in. She began to bang on the door continuing to shout and swear at him.”He said Beattie eventually opened the door and the woman asked him what he was doing. He replied: “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I just got confused.”She followed Beattie out into the restaurant and told staff what had happened. Security staff were called. Beattie told them he’d gone into the wrong toilets by mistake because he was in urgent need, repeatedly saying he was sorry. Police were contacted and he was arrested and charged.Kevin Dugan defending said he had commissioned a psychiatric report for the court because he had concerns about Beattie’s mental health.He told the court: “He is suffering from a borderline personality disorder. I’ll provide a copy of the report to the criminal justice social work team.”Sherf Martin Edington added Beattie’s name to the sex offenders’ register with immediate effect because the case had a “signicant sexual element” and deferred sentencing until Wednesday, July  for background reports.Beattie, currently a prisoner at Addiewell, was told he would remain in custody until the hearing."},{"url":null,"title":"prettylittlething blasted ridiculous bikini sizing","story":"NewsPrettyLittleThing blasted for ridiculous bikini sizing by fuming shopperLydia Ramsey has vowed to never buy from PrettyLittleThing again after her boobs burst out of bikini topShareCommentsByJames Rodger:,  JUN NewsHow the bikini should look \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA furious shopper has blasted PrettyLittleThing for their sizing after she posted a picture of her boobs spilling out of a bikini top.

Dunn-Koczorowski, whose posts included support for far-right terrorist Anders Breivik and the threat of ethnic cleansing of Albanians, demonstrated a highly radicalised and violent mindset, the court heard. Prosecutor Naomi Parsons said the posts, made across three accounts by the two teenagers convey a message of the threat of and or use of serious violence against others, in order to advance a political, ideological and racial causeand in this way encourage terrorism. She told the court targets included Jewish people, non-white people and anyone perceived to be complicit in the perpetuation of multi-culturalism.    Dunn-Koczorowski, , from west London, is being sentenced for two counts of encouraging terrorism. Szewczuk, who was arrested in December at his halls of residence during his first year studying computer science at Portsmouth University, pleaded guilty in April to possession of documents including the White Resistance Manual and the al Qaida Manual.

The Duke channelled his mother’s crusade and called landmines “a humanitarian issue not a political one”. Diana famously wore a protective visor and vest to visit a minefield cleared by the Halo Trust in the wartorn country, just months before her death in . Images of her visit prompted mine clearing efforts worldwide. In a speech at a Chatham House Africa Programme event in London yesterdayHarry talked about the iconic moment. He said: “I was told just the other day of the positive transformation in Huambo since my mother walked that minefield all those years ago.    “What is less well-known is the impact landmines can have on conservation and wildle, and therefore the economy.” He called mines “remnants of war” and pushed for them to finally be cleared to allow wildle and tourists toand help Angola finish its “long journey, full of heartache and frustration”. He said: “My hope is that, through this collaboration, minefields can be cleared, land can be protected, wildle can be free toto where they once roamed, and Angolans can reap the rewards by co-existing with the one constant that will draw people in from all over the world - the extraordinary setting that they call home.” Harry commented about his first visit to Chatham House in June  to take part in a scenario-planning exercise. He told delegates attending the landmine conference: “That exercise showed me the importance of landmine clearance within a humanitarian emergency because, let’s not forget, land mines are a humanitarian issue, not a political one.” In recent years the Duke has taken on Diana’s humanitarian legacy in Africa.    In , Harry followed in his mother’s footsteps when he visited Angola with the Halo Trust to meet victims of the munitions and observe work to remove the ordnance. Speaking about his visit to Angola, Harry added: “In Cuando Cubango, in the far south-east of what is a vast, beautul country, I saw a struggling community in a deserted landscape unable to make use of the land.”Last week, the Mirror exclusively revealed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are planning a trip to Angola later this year to continue his Diana’s humanitarian and conservation work.Harry, who is patron of the Halo Trust, is hoping to continue his mother’s work for the mine clearance charity. The couple are expected to travel together with baby Archie for at least some of the Autumn tour, which will also include a stop in Malawi to expand the reach of Harry’s charity Sentebale, South Africa and possibly Botswana.    In the speech, he leant his support to a plan by the Angola’s Environment minister Paula Coelho to spend  million dollarsfunding the work of the Halo Trust. He also made the case for the wildle of the Okavango Delta, where animals have been hurt by landmines. The funds will be used to clear  minefields in a huge conservation region of Angola, a savannah area that is home to vital waterways that flow into the Okavango Delta, in nearby Botswana, a Unesco World Heritage site. Harry said: “Angola’s remaining wilderness was “an asset that should be protected, celebrated and benefited by its people”.Tory leadership candidate and International Development Secretary Rory Stewart was among the guests. In  his department pledged a £ million aid package over three years to help rid the world of landmines."},{"url":null,"title":"royal expert left cringing harry","story":"NewsRoyal expert left cringing at Harry and Meghans repeated Instagram blundersThe hugely popular @sussexroyal account has made a few errors over the past two monthsShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video harry-meghan-mark-fathers-day-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIn the battle of the Royal Instagram accounts, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge may be emerging as the winners - but the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs account is definitely catching them up. Just hours after the @sussexroyal account went live on April  it amassed a huge amount of followers, with Meghan Markle believed to be behind many of its posts. Yet despite the fanfare and massive reaction that comes with each post, royal experts have been picking up on some awkward blunders. Melanie Bromley has been left cringing at repeated mistakes on the account, with the two recurring issues being grammar and punctuation.  They keep making mistakes on their Instagram , Melanie told  E! News  of the Sussexaposs account. There is a website that points them out every single time they post. Not many people can claim to have never made a mistake on a social media post, but unfortunately for Meghan and Harry, there are millions of pairs of eyes on theirs - many of which delight in the couple slipping up.    One such error was made in a caption on an Earth Day post and was picked up on by a grammar-savvy fan. The final line under the photo read: Every one of us can make a dference, not just today but everyday. However, the person responsible for the post should have written every day rather than everyday, which is an adjective.    Other issues include the page taking down and then reposting a photo and caption with a repeated line in the lead-up to Archieaposs birth last month. A social media manager employed to do this sort of thing is likely to be trained to a pretty rigorous standard. If Meghan is behind the coupleaposs account, however, then itaposs more likely that very common errors will occur, what with a newborn to look after.

Megan was born in Bolivia but moved to the UK at eight-years-old.Her addiction began as a teenager spending most weekends binge drinking with friends. But then it got worse. Following nights out with friends sheaposd wake up with mysterious bruises and there were nights I couldnapost remember getting home, she said. She has opened up about her relationship with alcohol on her blog Sober Story, which documents her le as a drinker compared with her more wholesome sober lestyle. Megan says she also abused alcohol to try to deal with the stress and solitude of running her own business as a financial consultant and trying to raise two young children alone.    She had her first child, a daughter, in , then a son in , but the breakup with their dad in  hit her hard, as did an accident in which her father nearly drowned. Megan said: It was a build up of a lot of dficult situations and emotions - dealing with the break up and my dad almost dying. Iaposd been trying to avoid feeling a lot of things and turned to wine. Eventually she was drinking every day to try to feel better, but always feeling worse the morning after, whether sheaposd been out with friends or downing bottle of wine at home alone.

Megan had been debating quitting alcohol for months but it turned out this was the support group for her. She joined the challenge, and got advice and encouragement from others in their WhatsApp group. In terms of community it was really helpful, she said. Family and friends were also supportive, but it was by no means a quick, easy fix. I had to spend a long time retraining myself, Megan said.  She has found that a combination of small habits throughout the day, from drinking more water and eating properly to journaling are among the things that help her stay healthy and alcohol-free. I just feel better looked after and better prepared to deal with the stress of le, she said. Her healthier habits even served her when she lost her father, who had Parkinsonaposs, this year.

In a recent blog post she shared what a year of being sober has taught her. She wrote: I really feel that this is only the beginning of what is possible for me and for my le. I have learned that I am not the anxious, angry, sad mess that I believed I was. I do not need to punish myself and I do not need to spend my le worrying about every single thing.

Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing.

Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins.

Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day.

Hot on their heels, Mid Argyll Community Pool is moving from plastic bottles to refills.Jilly Wilson of the Square Peg said: #I was aware of the number of plastic bottles of water we sold and it seemed such a waste.

you canrsquot believe how strong it is.ldquoI have papier mache furniture in my house and Jean has a sofa bed that shersquos used for  years so that is a testament to its durability.ldquoI know a lot of people in Britain will find it hard to grasp the idea that schools simply donrsquot even have chairs for children.ldquoFor children with cerebral palsy this is a real problem and they get terrible secondary disabilities from being forced to just lie on the floor.ldquoWhen I first looked into this problem, every time I tried to get carpenters to make them it cost way too much.ldquoThis solution costs a fraction of the thousands of pounds it would cost for a joiner to craft them and enables us to help so many more children.Cerebral Palsy Africa has previously worked in Malawi and Zambia and will now use its pound, SCCF grant to help children in Ghana.Archie added: ldquoThis two-year project will give our knowledge and skills to special needs teachers so that children with cerebral palsy can be given a much better chance of education.ldquoWe have  special needs teachers and two lecturers coming to Accra from across Ghana to attend a -day course in a venue provided by our partner organisation, Multikids Africa.ldquoThey will receive training in physiotherapy and in making this papier mache equipment.ldquoThe hope is that we can do something similar to what we achieved in Malawi.ldquoThe course that finished in  trained  teachers over six years.ldquoRoughly  children with cerebral palsy have benefited directly but of course those teachers are teaching lots of other people to make this furniture so itrsquos likely many other people in communities are benefitting from a knock-on multiplying effect.ldquoWersquove found that people are also using it to make little pieces of furniture for their homes or to sell so it can become an income generating thing as well with benefits for the local economy.SCCF grants are operated by the Department for International Development .A DFID spokesperson said: ldquoCerebral Palsy Africarsquos innovative furniture making project is giving some of the worldrsquos most vulnerable children the opportunity to go to school.ldquoBritainrsquos small charities do an extraordinary amount of good in the world.ldquoThey embody our generosity and our concern, as a country, for helping others.ldquoUK aidrsquos Small Charities Challenge Fund is there to make sure they get the support they need to help us end poverty once and for all.ldquoThe fund will re-open this year and we are encouraging small charities from every corner of the UK to apply."},{"url":null,"title":"health-secretary-promises-severe-consequences-if-any-wrongdoing-over-listeria","story":"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has promised ldquosevere consequencesthere is evidence of ldquowrongdoing following an outbreak of listeria.Five people are suspected to have died after an outbreak of listeria in hospitals.Speaking in the Commons, Mr Hancock said: ldquoThe NHS has identied nine confirmed cases of listeria in seven dferent hospitals between April  and May , all linked to contaminated sandwiches from a single supplier.ldquoAll the cases involved inpatients and, very sadly, five people have died.Mr Hancock expressed condolences to the families who have lost loved ones, and promised a root-and-branch review of food sold and served in hospitals.He added: ldquoI promise there will be a full and thorough investigation, and severe consequencesthere is any evidence of wrongdoing.Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth, who asked an urgent question on the issue, said: ldquoOur thoughts really must be with the families of those who have lost their lives.He added: ldquoI have been speaking to hospital catering staff in recent days and they have raised with me concerns about the tight finances, and that years of capital cuts have left kitchens substandard, and this has driven a move to greater outsourcing of catering, with sandwiches and soups steadily replacing hot meals.ldquoRecent data shows some hospitals spending less than pound per patient per day.ldquoDo you agree that this review should be backed up by investment in hospital catering, in facilities, and legally-backed clear minimum quality standards for hospital food ----Mr Hancock replied: ldquoIt is important to have the best quality food in hospitals. I am completely open to upgrading hospital equipmentthat is what is necessary andit provides value for money.ldquoI have been struck by the number of hospital chief executives that have said that, from the point of view of patient satisfaction, staff morale, and nutrition and the quality of food, bringing those food supplies in house is the best thing they have done.Answering Tory Sir Bill Cashrsquosquestion, Mr Hancock said: ldquoHersquos quite right to identy that this is a supply chain issue and that therersquos a complex supply chain in operation.SNP health and social care spokeswoman Dr Philippa Whitford raised the question of the incubation period and whether surveillance of trusts would continue at the same time as the investigation.She said: ldquoThese sandwiches were sold to  trusts and while there have been no cases since the th May the incubation of listeriosis is  days.She added: ldquoCan I ask him to pay particular attention to why on earth people who were seriously ill or frail were being fed sandwiches. Someone who has no appetite and is recovering from illness is simply not going to be tempted by a pack of sandwiches and therefore that really makes the case for bringing food preparation in hospital and producing tempting meals because nutrition is critical to recovery.Labourrsquos Lucy Powellraised outsourcing adding: ldquoSurely wersquove got to be a lot firmer here in identying that this growth in outsourcing food supplies is leading to some real safety issues and potentially to these deaths themselves.Tory Maria Caulfieldraised the issue of food spending and staffing levels.She said: ldquoWhile therersquos no evidence that cost is behind the tragic cases that wersquove heard of today, would the secretary of state in his root-and-branch review look at the price that hospitals are spending on food, a pound per meal is not enough for a healthy, nutritious meal for patients, some trusts are spending less than pound a day on patient food.ldquoWould he also look at legislating for safe staffing levels so therersquos enough nurses on the wards to feed patients, about a third of patients are eating less than half of the food that is served before them and are suffering from malnutrition.Mr Hancock replied: ldquoThose hospitals that have brought food production in-house and sourced locally-produced food not necessarily locally distributed food, but properly locally-produced food, have often found that it reduces costs rather than raises them.

In February, he suddenly changed his handle to ldquoelontusk. When he was later asked by reporters why he made the change, he confessed: ldquoI was just playing the fool on Twitter.His apparent intention to leave Twitter after a decade on the social media service attracted widespread attention largely because his account has turned into a hornetrsquos nest during the past year.The biggest flap occurred last August when he tweeted that he had lined up the financing necessary to buy Tesla in a buyout that would probably have cost more than  billion dollars, causing the electric car makerrsquos stock to swing wildly. An offer never materialised, and the Securities and Exchange Commission later accused Mr Musk of using Twitter to mislead investors.He denied the allegations, but he and Tesla eventually reached a  million dollar settlement with the SEC after regulators threatened to seek his removal as the companyrsquos CEO. Instead, he agreed to step down as Teslarsquos chairman for at least three years and also stipulated that his tweets tied to the company be pre-screened for accuracy.Twitter got Mr Musk into trouble again in February when the SEC alleged a tweet about how many cars Tesla will manufacture this year represented another misleading statement and sought to hold him in contempt of court for violating the settlement. That resulted in a new settlement that is supposed to put even tighter controls on his tweets about the company.Mr Musk is also embroiled in a defamation lawsuit for a tweet that described a British er involved in a rescue of boys trapped in an underwater cave in Thailand as a paedophile.

It was recommended that for approval.A report for the meeting, prepared by executive director of development and infrastructure Pippa Milne said: #Officers are of the view that the primary benefit to the council in having this site designated as a Centenary Fields site is more in the symbolic sense – that the site is officially recognised by both Fields in Trust and the Royal British Legion as space to be protected for future generations to enjoy.#[It would also be] to commemorate those servicemen and women, as well as civilians, who played their part in the First World War.#There may also be the opportunity to use Centenary Fields status to help lever in external funding for the site.#Every site receives a commemorative plaque to display on site, as well as receiving associated signage, the display of which is optional. There is no requirement for an actual name change.#This status does not prevent disposal at a future point in time, as long as disposal is of a clear advantage to, and in the best interests of, the community from a recreational perspective.#Ms Milne’s report also stated that the council would continue to manage and maintain the park, with Fields in Trust’s role purely an advisory one.There would be no minimum expectation for maintenance requirements, or pressure to make money as a result of any Centenary Fields status.Ms Milne added: #To achieve Centenary Fields status, the site must have a link to World War One and be suitable for sport, recreation and or play.#The only two sites which appear to officers to meet this criteria are Kinloch Park in Campbeltown and Hermitage Park in Helensburgh.#Given that the profile of Hermitage Park is being raised through the £ million restoration project, officers are of the view that, on balance, it would be more appropriate to put Kinloch Park forward.#This is on the basis that Kinloch Park is likely to derive greater benefit from this enhanced status and protection.#"},{"url":null,"title":"beautiful meal accompanies swi agm","story":"President Jean Ives welcomed the members to the tearoom where Frances Hill provided the sustenance.The formal business included a review of the previous year’s events in which Southend#s SWI excelled, winning several events including bowls and a quiz.After a very successful year, the winter competitions# winner was Alison Eynon, who received the trophy, with Jen Ronald second and Fiona Rowland third.The retiring committee of Jean Ives, Fiona Rowland and Trish Jones were thanked for their hard work over the previous three years.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

This really is an exceptional moment in politics. Everyone says that Boris Johnson is unreliable, untruthful, unfaithful, unruly and unpredictable. Yet, he is almost certainly going to be our next Prime Minister. How did we get here Hes a chat show celebrity, of course. But its not ashes seen in a positive light by the media glitterati. Last week, Ian Hislop, the lead list on BBCs Have I Go News For You, on which Boris famously starred, called for him to be jailed. TV presenters loathe Johnson, which is why his minders have tightly controlled his TV studio exposure. He has been pilloried in the press, rubbished on social media and disowned by Tory cabinet ministers.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, made no secret of her dislike for the former London Mayor and even launched a campaign, ldquoOperation Arse to stop him. The Conservative Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said he ldquowouldnt serve in a Johnson cabinet . But somehow all this bounces off the Teflon Blonde. In last weeks first round of voting, Johnson won more that twice the votes of his nearest rival.The short answer of course is Brexit, but that doesnt explain why Tory MPs are so keen to have this recklessly outspoken politician as their leader. The other candidates are no less Brexity than he is. Yet he is crushing the le out of them.Iain Macwhirter: Brace yourselves, wersquore in for a Trump-Johnson double actHard man Dominic ldquokarate Raab, is a dedicated No Dealer, yet he was left gasping on the canvas after last weeks votes. The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, is still in the race, despite his cocaine confessions, but only just. Sajid Javid, has ldquoalso ran written all over him, despite winning the support of Ruth Davidson.This just leaves the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as the safety-first candidate. Hell probably win enough votes to come second to Johnson and be one of the two candidates offered to the wider Conservative Party membership. But he is so colourless - a male version of Theresa May - that hes most unlikely to succeed. Tories realise that this isnt the time for safety-first candidates. Theyve been there done that.Media commentators have been talking up the ldquoWhite Walker, Development Secretary, Rory Stewart, who squeaked into the second round. He certainly has a good back story, with his wanderings in Afghanistan, and possesses the effortless self-confidence that only an Eton education can provide. Hes a youthful breath of fresh air, but Tories arent interested in fresh air right now. They prefer the fug of populism.Which leaves us with Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister. Even as I write that again I can still hardly believe it. Consider this testimonial by one of Johnsons former employers. ldquoHe is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier figure than the public appreciates...I would not take Boriss word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.That was Johnsons former editor, Max Hastings, of the Tory-supporting Daily. In the same article, Hastings said thatJohnson ever became Prime Minister hed be ldquoon the first plane out of Britain. I hope hes booked his tickets.: Scottish Tory MP warns Boris Johnson against trying to \"subvert\" leadership voteEveryone knows that the former London Mayor was sacked as a journalist for lying, and then again as a junior minister for lack of candour. His infidelities are legion. Hersquos barely capable of appearing in public without provoking offence, usually from ethnic minorities. Three years ago he won pound from the Spectator magazine for a limerick that referred to the President of Turkey having sex with a goat.You think Im making that up, dont you  But the next PM really did write this about of President Recip Erdogan: ldquoThere was a young fellow from Ankara. Who was a terric w@nkerer. Till he sowed his wild oats. With the help of a goat. But he didnt even stop to thankera. Dont think hell be reprising that when he meets the Turkish President.The Tories used to be the sober, serious and sensible party. The political wing of the Anglican Church. Its in the name: ldquoConservative. So what are they doing electing this man  Are Tory MPs so addled by Brexit they cant see whats coming  A Prime Minister as chaotic and unpredictable as Donald Trump.In many ways, Boris Johnson seems the polar opposite of Trump. In terms of education, wit, literary ability and social background, he couldnt be more dferent to the belligerent billionaire. But they share one important characteristic: they are charismatic populists. They are rule breakers, who can be guaranteed to defy convention, for good or ill. Theyre not really politicians in the conventional sense, but anti-politicians, repositories of popular discontent.Many voters like Boris because he is the embodiment of political incorrectness. He is guaranteed to provoke outrage from the professional offence-takers and social justice warriors who populate social media. Many middle Americans voted for Donald Trump, not because they expected him to be a model president, but because he would upset self-righteous scolds who tell people what to say and what to think. The woke s of the culture wars, who police the language of ersity, and condemn jokes about gays, women or racial minorities.Boris is also someone who will make trouble, and many voters want to make trouble right now. That is why, paradoxically, the party of the establishment, is embracing someone whose demeanour seems so anti-establishment. Conservatives know that the only thing that matters is getting power and keeping it. Back in the day, this involved electing boring politicians in sensible suits who wouldnt frighten the middle classes and would invite deference from in the lower orders. Politicians behaved like bank managers, headmasters, churchmen.But the middle classes have been plunged into insecurity by the financial crash, working people no longer defer to authority figures, and respect for religion has largely vanished from our secular public realm. In many ways, the passing of deference is a good thing. But we have also become an irritable and fractious society that doesnt know what it wants, but wants it now. Brexit is a touchstone issue here: a political project which no one really understands, because it is about complex trading law, but on which everyone has an emotionally-charged point of view.Boris Johnson, is natural material for these emotive times. He is a performance artist, really, a living commentary on the state of society. A politician of shting principle, who is not expected to honour his promises, and whose moral compass is his own ambition. So, prepare for a bumpy ride. The one thing Boris Johnson will never be is boring."},{"url":null,"title":"home-renters-over-50-reach-record-levels-across-the-uk","story":"Figures from the Hamptons International Monthly Lettings Index show that, across Britain, over-s accounted for a total of  per cent of rented households, up from  per cent in .The research also showed that almost one third of this group are pensioners.Scottish Labour said the index shows that it is not just younger generations who are struggling to get on the property ladder.Pauline McNeill, the partyrsquos housing spokeswoman, said: ldquoScotland is facing a housing crisis, and it is an issue not just facing young people.ldquoAround , retired adults are now forced to privately rent ndash eating away at their pension and risking being pushed into poverty.ldquoThatrsquos why the next Scottish Labour government will introduce a cap on private sector rent increases with a Mary Barbour law and build at least , new homes for affordable social-rent.ldquoOnly Labour has the radical vision to give Scotland the real change it needs to ensure we have a country that works for the many, not the few.The research showed that across the UK, almost , homes were rented by over-s -  per cent more than in  and . per cent more than last year.This means that older generations paid a total of pound. billion on rent this year, up from just pound. billion in  and pound. billion in .Tenants over- paid an average of pound per month on rent -  per cent more than other tenants.Most older renters live in two bedroom propertiesaccording to the data, with % choosing a three bed and % living in a one-bedroom home.Almost halflive alone.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons International, said: ldquoThe number of over rsquos renting in Great Britain has reached a record high.ldquoWith younger generations much less likely to be homeowners, tenants are getting older, and an ever more erse group of people are calling the rented sector home.ldquoRising rents in the South drove rental growth in Great Britain in May.ldquoThe South West recorded the strongest rental growth, with rents rising .% year-on-year.ldquoWales and the East were the only regions to record small rent falls.Across the UK, the average cost of new lets rose to pound per month, representing a . per cent increase year on year, driven by the rise in the rental market in the South West.Meanwhile rents in Greater London increased .% year-on-year, while the East and Wales were the only regions to record negative rental growth, with average rents falling -.% and -.% respectively.The South East has the highest proportion of older renters, where nearly one in fivetenants are over .

We have this old electricity grid and were able to replace existing devices within the electricity grid, in this case transformers, with Faraday Exchangers, which are like the router for the internet of electricity.\"We can literally take out one single transformer which needs to be replaced anyway.\"They are reaching end of le and we can put in one Faraday Exchanger, which can do everything a transformer does, but it does so much more.\"Its able to control the voltage, remove all the noise from the signal.\"We can control the power factor to balance across all these phases and we do it all within a single device.\"All of a sudden youre not having to add all this extra complexity into the network and you get this really nice  that enables double the amount of renewable energy onto the system.\"It reduces losses, it makes everything more flexible, more resilient and I see it is an enabling technology.\": Energy firm boosted by US investmentMr Williams said: \"We come in and our technology helps deal with the physics and economics in the short-term volatility of renewables.\"But it also provides a  for other technologies whether it be storage, batteries or fly-wheels, or whatever we end up using, all these things can work in collaboration with Faraday Grid to solve the bigger picture to really enable this energy future that we all want.\"The company aims to be at full commercial status within two years.\"It was one of the key designs considerations when we started working on this many years ago, is that we needed a system that was going to give us this future but it had to be achievable as well.\"We had to have a pathway that we could afford to actually do and one that was going to technically allow us to get to the right endpoint.\"So, thats why one of the major things was how do we do this transition, and thats why a Faraday Exchanger is designed to be a drop-in replacer where a transformer would traditionally be located because we know that theres already a capital replacement schedule in place for those out there.\": Energy firm boosted by US investmentHe said: \"You dont need to replace everything all at once and suddenly switch over to this new system.\"A Faraday Exchanger can literally be dropped into the existing network and it immediately adds value in its local area.\"It resolves the problems of noise in the system and voltage control and these things.\"But then as you start putting multiple exchangers within a grid, they start collaborating and coordinating to form a Faraday Grid and the value that Faraday Grid delivers as a system, rather than those inidual devices, is much better than any inidual device can give by itself.\"One of the key constraints is what we can afford to do. It needs to be achievable, so again its designed in such a way that with existing capital replacement budgets that utilities already have, you can roll out Faraday Grid.\"Instead of buying transformers and all this other equipment, theyre able to just buy Faraday Exchangers instead.\"But because with Faraday Grid the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts, what we actually do with utilities is work very close with them and we simulate the entirety of their network,\"We look at their whole network, we can look at how powers generated and used at the moment, what they expect to happen in the future and not only can we then in the virtual world determine what that grid should look like in , ,  years time with them, wecan actually also then start to look at the economics of it and say well,you stay within your existing capital budget, this would be when you would target putting in the first devices because theyre going to have the biggest benefit.\"Butyou wanted to expedite roll-out to get things faster, it would deliver these additional benefits. You then wouldnt be so dependent on the balancing services.\"A Faraday Grid is able to provide that balancing service from the grid itself, rather than having to procure it from external parties.\"So whilst were making the grid more flexible and having more renewables, were also reducing the cost of energy to the consumer.\"Were still pre-commercial with the technology at the moment.\"Weve manufactured devices, weve had external testing through our power networks demonstration centre in Glasgow.\"Were on the pathway to our next stage as a business is doing what I would call proof of concept projects with utilities.\"Weve targeted utilities as our first pathway into the market because the network effect of operating within the grid allows us to have a real multiplier effect and its where we can add the most value.\"So we will work with a number of utilities globally to do these projects over the next year or two and on the back of that we will be a full commercial business.\"Its tremendously exciting. Scotland has been a great place for us as a business. Theres great talent both in Scotland and Scotlands obviously being very open as a country has enabled us to attract talent from across Europe as well.\"Its at the forefront of all renewables and pushing the boundaries and quite innovative. So its been a fantastic place for a business like us. But then very similar to Australia.ldquoIts going to be quite collaborative because, as an engineer I would say physics is everywhere.\"Our technology is ubiquitous, we want to be able to deliver the value that we have to the world.\"Scotland and the UK is very important, but we also want to be able to add value in Europe and North America and Australia and Japan and these key markets. In order to do that we need to grow very quickly as a business.\"So we have established innovation centres, its set in Scotland and then in Washington DC and now in Czech Republic as well and thats just to enable us to have the right skills and resources to be able to deliver globally.\"We have plans to open additional centres as well.

He sources sustainable packaging - using six-pack rings made from whisky waste- and suppliers, uses as much of every ingredient in his drinks as possible and has plans to invest in an electric vehicle in the future.He said: ldquoI want Rapscallion to be a sustainable business eco-system. The ultimate goal would be a production facility up in Fe, so were near all the growers, with solar , wind turbines, and using recycled rainwater. We want to cut down on the stuff that ends up in landfill.Gregor has big plans for Rapscallion, in Scotland and beyond and hopes that the sodas he has invested all of his time, energy and money in will change the way we drink,He said:ldquoWe just want to be real with people.

Mr Hancock expressed condolences to the families who have lost loved ones, and promised a root-and-branch review of food sold and served in hospitals.He added: ldquoI promise there will be a full and thorough investigation, and severe consequencesthere is any evidence of wrongdoing.Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth, who asked an urgent question on the issue, said: ldquoOur thoughts really must be with the families of those who have lost their lives.He added: ldquoI have been speaking to hospital catering staff in recent days and they have raised with me concerns about the tight finances, and that years of capital cuts have left kitchens substandard, and this has driven a move to greater outsourcing of catering, with sandwiches and soups steadily replacing hot meals.ldquoRecent data shows some hospitals spending less than pound per patient per day.ldquoDo you agree that this review should be backed up by investment in hospital catering, in facilities, and legally-backed clear minimum quality standards for hospital food  -- --Mr Hancock replied: ldquoIt is important to have the best quality food in hospitals. I am completely open to upgrading hospital equipmentthat is what is necessary andit provides value for money.ldquoI have been struck by the number of hospital chief executives that have said that, from the point of view of patient satisfaction, staff morale, and nutrition and the quality of food, bringing those food supplies in house is the best thing they have done.Answering Tory Sir Bill Cashrsquosquestion, Mr Hancock said: ldquoHersquos quite right to identy that this is a supply chain issue and that therersquos a complex supply chain in operation.SNP health and social care spokeswoman Dr Philippa Whitford raised the question of the incubation period and whether surveillance of trusts would continue at the same time as the investigation.She said: ldquoThese sandwiches were sold to  trusts and while there have been no cases since the th May the incubation of listeriosis is  days. She added: ldquoCan I ask him to pay particular attention to why on earth people who were seriously ill or frail were being fed sandwiches. Someone who has no appetite and is recovering from illness is simply not going to be tempted by a pack of sandwiches and therefore that really makes the case for bringing food preparation in hospital and producing tempting meals because nutrition is critical to recovery.Labourrsquos Lucy Powellraised outsourcing adding: ldquoSurely wersquove got to be a lot firmer here in identying that this growth in outsourcing food supplies is leading to some real safety issues and potentially to these deaths themselves.Tory Maria Caulfieldraised the issue of food spending and staffing levels.She said: ldquoWhile therersquos no evidence that cost is behind the tragic cases that wersquove heard of today, would the secretary of state in his root-and-branch review look at the price that hospitals are spending on food, a pound per meal is not enough for a healthy, nutritious meal for patients, some trusts are spending less than pound a day on patient food.ldquoWould he also look at legislating for safe staffing levels so therersquos enough nurses on the wards to feed patients, about a third of patients are eating less than half of the food that is served before them and are suffering from malnutrition.Mr Hancock replied: ldquoThose hospitals that have brought food production in-house and sourced locally-produced food not necessarily locally distributed food, but properly locally-produced food, have often found that it reduces costs rather than raises them. So this isnrsquot a question of resources, it is question of good practice.copy -. This site is part of Newsquests audited local newspaper network. A Gannett Company.

Then he signalled in a tweet that he was scrapping the account. But  hours later, the account remained open under its old ldquoelonmusk handle with  million followers.Just deleted my Twitter accountmdash Daddy DotComJune , Mr Musk has used his Twitter account to pull pranks and make baffling changes in the past. In February, he suddenly changed his handle to ldquoelontusk. When he was later asked by reporters why he made the change, he confessed: ldquoI was just playing the fool on Twitter.His apparent intention to leave Twitter after a decade on the social media service attracted widespread attention largely because his account has turned into a hornetrsquos nest during the past year.The biggest flap occurred last August when he tweeted that he had lined up the financing necessary to buy Tesla in a buyout that would probably have cost more than  billion dollars, causing the electric car makerrsquos stock to swing wildly. An offer never materialised, and the Securities and Exchange Commission later accused Mr Musk of using Twitter to mislead investors.He denied the allegations, but he and Tesla eventually reached a  million dollar settlement with the SEC after regulators threatened to seek his removal as the companyrsquos CEO. Instead, he agreed to step down as Teslarsquos chairman for at least three years and also stipulated that his tweets tied to the company be pre-screened for accuracy.Twitter got Mr Musk into trouble again in February when the SEC alleged a tweet about how many cars Tesla will manufacture this year represented another misleading statement and sought to hold him in contempt of court for violating the settlement. That resulted in a new settlement that is supposed to put even tighter controls on his tweets about the company.Mr Musk is also embroiled in a defamation lawsuit for a tweet that described a British er involved in a rescue of boys trapped in an underwater cave in Thailand as a paedophile. That tweet, posted last July, has since been deleted, and Mr Musk is fighting the lawsuit filed by Vernon Unsworth in a Los Angeles state court.copy -.

Back then, the joke was one of many in which male demands – for food, for clean laundry, for sex – were dismissed as a marker of female empowerment. “How can you make the male orgasm more intense  Who cares ” was another. Though they made a powerful point, these jokes might be considered beyond the pale today the first, in particular, does not endorse domestic abuse, but it does make light of it, and society is, quite rightly, less tolerant of the normalisation of violence than it used to be Delilah.Last week, Brand made another joke involving violence. Askedshe agreed Britain was living through a terrible parliamentary time, she told BBC Radio ’s Heresy programme: “Yes, I would say that because certain unpleasant characters are being thrown to the fore, and they’re very, very easy to hate, and I’m kind of thinking, why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid ”This wasn’t as clever as the breadkne joke nor was it judicious. It didn’t take long for Nigel Farage, milkshake survivor and early adopter of the “snowflake” jibe, to get on the case within a matter of hours, Brand was facing calls for her to be sacked by the BBC, and the police had launched an investigation .Judging from the many character references she has accrued over the past few days, Brand is a good and likeable human being who has mellowed since her days as a ball-breaker. Given her comments were made on a satirical show, they couldn’t really be construed as incitement to violence, and she later offered a whole-hearted apology – in contrast to the self-serving one recently proffered by Danny Baker.Judging by the character assassinations accrued by Farage over the past four years, he is a bad and dislikeable human being given he has previously stoked hatred towards immigrants and recently defended Ann Widdecombe over her apparent endorsement of gay conversion therapy, it is impossible to regard his response to Brand as anything other than hypocrisy.Nevertheless, at a time when the atmosphere in the UK is febrile when people are genuinelywhen one MP has been murdered and others have received death threats, all public figures – including comedians – ought to be extra vigilant about their use of language. Like Frankie Boyle’s “Where the F*** are the IRA when you need them ” quip about Theresa May’s famous Chequers meeting, Brand’s joke runs the risk of normalising revenge as a response to these most dficult of times.Accepting Brand made a misjudgment, however, does not prevent us asking why comedians are taking so much flak for mocking politicians when politicians are taking the piss out of the electorate without facing any repercussions at all. Why are Victorian villains like coke-snorting Michael Gove and Jacob Rees “I’m allergic to the concept of human rights” Mogg, given free rein to spread their repugnant views regardless of the offence they cause  Why is Boris Johnson – a man who once discussed a plan to have a tabloid journalist beaten up – still considered a viable candidate for prime minister  Brand’s flippancy is much less toxicthan their mendacity.A few days before Brand made her comments, two High Court judges ruled Johnson should not face charges over comments he made during the EU referendum campaign about the UK sending £m a week to Brussels. The UK does not send £m a week to Brussels. In most contexts his claim – emblazoned on the side of the Leave bus – would be considered a “lie”. But for the purposes of this piece let’s call it “spin”. While Brand’s light-hearted remarks attracted much ire, Boris’s “spin” – which fuelled the eventual Leave victory and so played a key role in creating this crisis – was judged not to constitute an abuse of power. Spin : Jokes, nil.Meanwhile, there is no suggestion that a referendum – held on a whim, without a plan, by a bunch of empty egotists – could be voided. Even though the campaign was illegally funded even though it was based on myths, the result is touted as the democratic will of the country. That’s a prank and a half, isn’t it  Makes Brand’s jape look a bit flaccid. Of course, the laughter’s ringing hollow now companies are deserting our shores, and we’re nowhere nearer securing our actual exit. But, again, there are to be no apparent consequences for those who wrecked our children’s futures for the bantz.The reason those on the right feel able to stoke the backlash against Brand even as they defend the likes of Count Dankulaon freedom of speech grounds, is that this is not really about the jokes or the offence they cause: it’s a proxy war on the left.That’s why the right-wing papers consistently refer to Brand as a “left-wing” comedian it’s why commentators such as Piers Morgan whine on about double standards. Why was Baker sacked from the BBC [for a tweet that was perceived to be racist] and Brand wasn’t  Well,  because Brand isn’t employed by the BBCand  because there is no equivalence between race, which is an innate characteristic, and being a hard Brexiteer which is a poor lestyle choice.You could just as easily ask why Baker was sacked for a “racist” tweet , while comments about burqa-wearing women looking like letter boxes and references to piccaninnies glide off the slippery Johnson. The answer would be wealth and power and social connections. The answer would be Eton and the Bullingdon Club and the old boys’ network.These are the evils that are breaking Britain not some off-colour joke on a satirical programme. So, yes, comedians: think before you speak. Try not to make the Brexit debate more poisonous than it already is. But also, the rest of us: let’s not fixate over offensive jests at the expense of whopping great lies. What the likes of Boyle and Brand do to right-wing politicians is far less damaging than what right-wing politicians are doing to the country.

For some reason, these findings of the grandly titled #Mood of the Nation# survey, are meant to come as a surprise. per cent of Britons feel pessimistic about national unity.  per cent say British politics is not fit for purpose. One in five people expects to be a victim of violent crime or to witness attacks on friends or family members.  per cent feel let down by the political establishment   per cent believe the country has become an international laughing stock. Leave voters and elderly people are almost twice as optimistic about the future as twenty-somethings and Remain voters. : Tory leadership debate: Rivals turn on Dominic Raab as Boris Johnson stays at homeBut these disparate groups also agree on a few things. A staggering  per cent think the UK needs a strong leader but only  per cent think the next Prime Minister will be up to the job. There is Britain’s problem in a baffling nutshell.The mismatch between longed-for political superhero and typical party leader clearly contributes massively to voter-dissatisfaction. If voters think a “strong” Putin Trump or Farage style leaderis the solution to Britain’s problems, it’s no wonder they feel anxious and despairing, since no-one angling for the Toryleadership is single-handedly up to that mammoth task. : Boris Johnson could face vote of no confidencehe becomes PM says SNP leaderHowever, those contradictory responses lead me to conclude that very few Scots were included in this measure of “the national mood.” Scots have shortcomings, but the naïve belief that a single human being can “fix” the nation ain’t generally one of them. Our political debate revolves around the location and control of powers, institutions, democratic rules, taxes and weapon systems – inidualsless so.As usual, Scots examining this “major new survey” don’t knowthe findings include them orLondon-based data has been extrapolated to cover the whole of Britain. And the pollsters don’t feel obliged to even explain.This matters. If only a meaningless handful of Scots was involved in the survey commissioned by strategy consultants, Britain Thinks , it’ll be mildly annoying for us, but also a missed opportunity for the vexed southern electorate to get much-needed perspective on the real nature of “Britain-wide” gloom -- what generates it, what minimises it and therefore what might help English voters escape it.A massive poll conducted last year by the BBC, came up with the same overall pessimistic verdict, but drilled down further to discover that English folk were most gloomy, despite demographic dominance of every British institution from the BBC to the Commons while independence and Remain-voting Scots – thwarted in both referendums – were actually the cheeriest folk in Britain.Union supporters might argue that this is simply because Scots have the best of both worlds. There’s a more likely explanation. Scotland’s Yes voters remain upbeat, no matter the setbacks, because most are already mentally and emotionally detached from the failing institutions of the UK, have a clear, un-romanticised view of Britain’s imperial past and a shared vision, motivation or goal – call it what you will, but it keeps folk feeling hopeful, and that optimism might even have rubbed off on No voters and Conservatives who were found to be statistically more pessimistic. Love them or hate them, the Scottish Government believes better days lie ahead, and the BBC poll demonstrated that such conviction really matters in setting a benchmark for voter optimism.More Scots surveyed believed that the country’s best days were in the futurethan in the past . This was a marked contrast to England, where % said the country was better in the past while only % felt the best days were yet to come. According to the BBC’s own website “Polling experts said data showing greater optimism about the future in Scotland and Wales was largely down to responses from independence supporters in these areas.”Contrast the plight of folk in England with a  vision of past glory, a set of hard-to-eject Tory politicians on an endless, dignity-reducing mission to cut public services without a leboat, parachute or escape route in sight. No wonder gloom abounds. The BBC survey also found that  per cent of Scots surveyed thought Scotland was better than most other countries in the world. Just  per cent thought it was worse. That could mean we have an o’er guid conceit of ourselves – “wha’s like us” -- but it could also mean Scots know we are blessed compared to the majority of poorer nations across the world and our gubbed, hopeless southern neighbours who still hope a strong leader can save them. Just for the record, the BBC’s  survey, spoke to more than , people in Scotland, a similar number in Wales and more than , in England. The Britain Thinks’ sample total was just two thousand people.Does it mattercommentators and London based politicians think the whole UK is covered in a unorm blanket of despair  Will the Britain Thinks diagnosis of mass hopelessness be dismissed as a national nervous breakdown, or sourced to the pervasive elitism of British politics, the absence of grassroots democracy and the festering presence of nihilism and consumerism  Last week a Scottish commentator objected to Nicola Sturgeon’s talk of Scottish values. Values are indeed slippery things to define, but a le without them, without their clear, unapologetic shaping influence in politics produces precisely the kind of despair felt south of the border today.That’s why Rory Stewart has become a breath of fresh air amidst the stale, dishonesty of the Tory leadership campaign. I wouldn’t vote for a man who describes himself as the economic conservative who’ll get Brexit finished first. But he’s right to talk about trust. Essentially Rory Stewart is riding high amongst actual votersbecause he sounds like he wouldn’t sell his granny. If Scots do emerge as cheerier than English voters in this latest research, our optimism will have little to do with geography and everything to do with political culture, parliament, institutions and civic le, all of which explicitly reject Britain’s failed experiment with market supremacy.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !!

Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.What does horses have to do with speedsterIm not defending speeding. Im saying this is the safest bit of road we have for overtaking and saying that youcannot possibly know the speed of the other cars without measuring equipment.Engine power is expressed in horsepower and lots of horsepower enables some to be faster than others going up hills than others.Haydn I have driven small cars which feel like they need a push going up our hills, that is all.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

We were to stay in the Adelaide Suite on the th floor, which was the seamless marriage of stylish meets comfort. Our view was to the east of the city with the top of Scrabo Tower in the distance. A Nespresso coffee maker, tea, complimentary biccies and robes and slippers were waiting along with the latest magazines to delve into. If after the ultimate in sheer indulgence, guests can opt for the chance to slip into a ‘bespoke soak’ and have your tub ran for you by one of the hotel’s bath butlers which incorporates a bath filled with essential ESPA oils, self-heating eye masks and the all-important treats. They say that eating and sleeping are two of le’s greatest pleasures and at the Grand Central the hotel excels.Because it was a special occasion we were booked into the hotel’s exquisite Seahorse restaurant and as a storm whipped up on Bedford Street – yes this is June – we were greeted by manager Rachel Brown, a fantastic asset to the hotel and promptly welcomed with a slate of moreish, freshly baked Guinness and treacle bread. The bread was devoured before a delicate Amuse Bouche of raw roasted caullower in butter, caullower purée, blitzed beetroot and crispy kale seared in butter followed.Appetisers on the menu, devised by Executive Chef Damian Tumilty, included ham hock and foie gras terrine, local crab dressed in a yogurt and mirin sauce but it was the ‘stars’ of the sea, local scallops served with a Jersusalem artichoke velouté and black olives, times two, that won out. Mains of roast monkfish tail with herb crusted potatoes, beetroot and asparagus along with crispy pork belly with a sizable wedge of potato gratin, caullower and cider soaked raisins were ordered and were hands down two of the most memorable meals we have ever had the pleasure of eating. The chunky monkish tail was cooked perfectly with the beetroot and asparagus proving the right light companions to the dish. An empty plate across the table seconded my opinion that this was a stand out dining experience. Having next to no room I waved the white flag, napkin and declined dessert. My husband opted for a slated caramel, popcorn covered chocolate slice that complimented all that came before.Much has already been written about the Grand Central’s Observatory Bar, sat atop its rd floor being a must see – and every word of it is true. The bar is accessed via its own lt and operator and once brought in the views are nothing short of spectacular, encompassing the city and all its quarters. Over a pint and G#T we watched the sun disappear over a grey blanket of rain clouds and revert back again, such is having our own weather system.After the best night sleep in ages thanks to the hotel’s King Coil beds, we were back in the Seahorse for breakfast. All self service, there was no chance of going hungry as huge bowls of fresh fruit, coulis, muesli, granola and yogurt along with Irwin’s bread selection were all at your disposal. A hot breakfast is also on offer and my request of poached eggs was no trouble at the kitchen pass. Pots of freshly brewed coffee and tea set us up for the day and sadly it was time for check out.It was not an inconvenience for us or guests upon leaving to leave our bags at reception to collect at a later stage in the day, a great service when you still want to have a look round the shops and not have to ‘lug’ your luggage with you.The Grand Central celebrates its first birthday this month but already feels like it was always part of the Bedford Streetscape as it has set about making its mark. Tourists and those wanting something memorable to celebrate, can do so, in classic style, at the Grand Central.For more information visit www.grandcentralhotelbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reps and union leaders meet over upskirting","story":"NORTH Belfast political representatives have joined union officials in meeting two teachers who were the victims of ‘upskirting’ to discuss the need for legislation around the issue.The meeting, which took place at Stormont on Monday, comes after the conviction of, Timothy Boomer , who was recently convicted of five counts of outraging public decency in relation to videos he took as a pupil at a Co Fermanagh school in  and .In itself, the act of ‘upskirting’ is not a crime in the North of Ireland, and campaigners have long called for legislation on the issue, which was discussed at Monday’s meeting.Speaking to the North Belfast News, NASUWT official, Justin McCamphill, said:“We held the meeting to give the victims in that case to set out their experiences and to discuss why the current legislation is inadequate.“The women actually had to take a judicial review against the PPS before the case was prosecuted. It was prosecuted under counts of outraging public decency.“The problem with that law is that it doesn’t treat them as the victims – it treats the general public as the victims. The conviction only happened because it was proven to be a public place because there was more than two people present. If there were no other people there it wouldn’t be illegal at all.“We were there to argue for specic laws. There are similar laws in Scotland, England and Wales, but we want our own bespoke laws.”He added: “In the event that the assembly is up and running we will be going to the justice committee and asking them to make a recommendation to the Department of Justice to bring in legislation to address this.”Following the meeting, North Belfast People Before Profit Councillor, Fiona Ferguson stressed the importance of better legislation and culture change to deal with this kind of sexual crime.“These women were let down by their employer, the police and the legal system. At points they were essentially told ‘boys will be boys’ and even when a prosecution was made, it was under common law of ‘outraging public decency’, which means that in the eyes of the law, the public witnesses were the victims, not the teachers who were upskirted. “We need comprehensive legislation that deals with cases where images are taken deliberately and without consent, so that victims can have a reasonable expectation of justice. And we need a societal sht in how we view consent. It is not good enough that in  women feel unsafe in their workplaces. It is not good enough that cases of upskirting are being dealt with in ways that reinforce the ‘boys will be boys’ culture that justies sexual crime.“The DoJ proposes to adopt the voyeurism legislation in Britain but it would not have led to a prosecution in the case of these teachers, and that is shows that it is not comprehensive enough.’“These women are incredibly brave for speaking out for other women and girls, and NASUWT should be commended for supporting them and leading th"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":null,"title":"22 northern ireland schools could close because of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

I am completely open to upgrading hospital equipmentthat is what is necessary andit provides value for money.“I have been struck by the number of hospital chief executives that have said that, from the point of view of patient satisfaction, staff morale, and nutrition and the quality of food, bringing those food supplies in house is the best thing they have done.”Answering Tory Sir Bill Cash’squestion, Mr Hancock said: “He’s quite right to identy that this is a supply chain issue and that there’s a complex supply chain in operation.”SNP health and social care spokeswoman Dr Philippa Whitford raised the question of the incubation period and whether surveillance of trusts would continue at the same time as the investigation.She said: “These sandwiches were sold to  trusts and while there have been no cases since the th May the incubation of listeriosis is  days.”Surely we’ve got to be a lot firmer here in identying that this growth in outsourcing food supplies is leading to some real safety issues and potentially to these deaths themselvesMP Lucy PowellShe added: “Can I ask him to pay particular attention to why on earth people who were seriously ill or frail were being fed sandwiches. Someone who has no appetite and is recovering from illness is simply not going to be tempted by a pack of sandwiches and therefore that really makes the case for bringing food preparation in hospital and producing tempting meals because nutrition is critical to recovery.”Labour’s Lucy Powellraised outsourcing adding: “Surely we’ve got to be a lot firmer here in identying that this growth in outsourcing food supplies is leading to some real safety issues and potentially to these deaths themselves.”Tory Maria Caulfieldraised the issue of food spending and staffing levels.She said: “While there’s no evidence that cost is behind the tragic cases that we’ve heard of today, would the secretary of state in his root-and-branch review look at the price that hospitals are spending on food, a pound per meal is not enough for a healthy, nutritious meal for patients, some trusts are spending less than £ a day on patient food.“Would he also look at legislating for safe staffing levels so there’s enough nurses on the wards to feed patients, about a third of patients are eating less than half of the food that is served before them and are suffering from malnutrition.”Mr Hancock replied: “Those hospitals that have brought food production in-house and sourced locally-produced food not necessarily locally distributed food, but properly locally-produced food, have often found that it reduces costs rather than raises them. So this isn’t a question of resources, it is question of good practice.”"},{"url":null,"title":"these sixword horror stories have taken twitter by storm","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If that second deadline passes without any action, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says the Islamic Republic is likely to resume higher uranium enrichment.Here is where Iran’s nuclear programme now stands.– The nuclear deal\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Donald Trump shows a signed presidential memorandum after delivering a statement on the Iran nuclear deal at the White House Iran struck the nuclear deal in  with the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and China. The deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, grew out of secret talks US president Barack Obama’s administration held with Iran after Mr Rouhani, a relative moderate, took office.Iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium under the watch of UN inspectors in exchange for the lting of economic sanctions. International businesses rushed to do deals with Iran, most notably the billion-dollar sales by Airbus and Boeing.President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise of tearing up the deal because it did not address Iran’s ballistic missile programme or its involvement in regional conflicts, withdrew America from the accord in May . That halted promised international business deals and dealt a heavy blow to Iran’s already anaemic economy. In the time since, the Trump administration has said any country that imports Iranian crude will face US sanctions.– Iran’s nuclear facilities\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Three versions of domestically built centruges are shown in a live TV programme from Natanz, an Iranian uranium enrichment plant Natanz, in Iran’s central Isfahan province, hosts the country’s main uranium enrichment facility, located underground. Iran has one operating nuclear power plant in Bushehr, which it opened with Russia’s help in . Under the accord, Iran reconfigured a heavy-water reactor so it could not produce plutonium and agreed to convert its Fordo enrichment site – dug deep into a mountainside – into a research centre. Iran said on Monday it may stop the heavy-water reactor reconfiguration. Tehran also operates a more than -year-old research reactor in Tehran.– Iran’s uranium stockpileUnder the terms of the nuclear deal, Iran can keep a stockpile of no more than kgof low-enriched uranium. That is compared to the ,kgof higher-enriched uranium it once had. Currently, the accord limits Iran to enriching uranium to .%, which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant. Weapons-grade uranium needs to be enriched to around %. However, once a country enriches uranium to around %, scientists say the time needed to reach % is halved. Iran has previously enriched to %. Iranian officials say they have quadrupled their production of low-enriched uranium and will break the kg limit by June .– Iran’s centruges\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  President Hassan Rouhani visits the Bushehr nuclear power plant in  A centruge is a device that enriches uranium by rapidly spinning uranium hexafluoride gas. Under the atomic accord, Iran has been limited to operating , older-model IR- centruges. The IR- is based on a s Dutch design that Pakistani scientist AQ Khan used to build Islamabad’s nuclear weapons programme and later sold to Iran, Libya and North Korea.Iran has the technical ability to build and operate advanced versions called the IR-M, IR- and IR- at Natanz, but is barred from doing so under the nuclear deal. Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran’s nuclear programme, told The Associated Press in September that the IR-M and the IR- can enrich uranium five times faster than an IR-, while the IR- can do it  times faster. Western experts have suggested these centruges produce three to five times more enriched uranium in a year than the IR-s.Iran also mothballed many already-built centruges as part of the deal.– From ‘Atoms for Peace’ to StuxnetIran’s nuclear programme actually began with the help of the United States. Under its “Atoms for Peace” programme, America supplied a test reactor that came online in Tehran in  under the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. That help ended once Iran’s  Islamic Revolution overthrew the shah.In the s, Iran expanded its programme, including buying equipment from AQ Khan. Among its activities, Iran “may have received design information” for a bomb and researched explosive detonators, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.By August , Western intelligence services and an Iranian opposition group revealed a covert nuclear site at Natanz. Iran to this day denies its nuclear programme had a military dimension. Iran suspended enrichment in  but resumed it three years later under hard-line president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. World powers imposed crippling UN sanctions in response. The Stuxnet computer virus, widely believed to be a joint US-Israeli creation, soon disrupted thousands of Iranian centruges.A string of bombings, blamed on Israel, targeted a number of scientists beginning in  at the height of Western concerns over Iran’s programme. Israel never claimed responsibility for the attacks, though Israeli officials have boasted in the past about the reach of the country’s intelligence services. Israel last year said it seized records from a “secret atomic archive” in Iran."},{"url":null,"title":"derry city cemetery series editor londonderry standard hard fought campaign tenants rights","story":"James McKnight was born on February ,  at Rathfriland, Co Down into a farming family of the Presbyterian denomination.To this day he is well regarded amongst historians of Ulster’s nineteenth century political turmoil as a stalwart of the liberalism often lacking in this part of the world.Identied as an exceptionally gted linguist from a young age, his education saw him become able to converse in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German and French as well as being a fluent Gaelic speaker having learned it from his father.Initially educated in Newry he then entered the seminary of the old Royal Academical Institution in Belfast in  and was regarded as a sound theologian and a powerful orator. However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

The clouds parted and the sun came out and brought with it a grand selection of  quality road racers.During the run up to this event there has been huge amounts of work from our former club person of the year and who is back gunning for that trophy again.With every well run event it is the behind the scenes work that allow us to bring an exciting a safe race, so a big shout to all the DCC helpers as well as the handicap group fairy for setting up the groups so that they would all finish on the same lap at the same time.There were four groups who started with ying handicaps and the potential of a prime lap sprint on the fth lap must surely have been a suitable carrot to keep everybody driving through.This course is not one where you get to hide in the group and wait until the end to sprint for the line ndash itrsquos clearly been designed by a mountain biker.Plenty of hard, tight climbs to make you work from the start line whether you are at the front of the group or at the end. At the end of lap one you could see cracks starting to appear in all the groups.Eddie Doyle could be seen grimacing and cracking the whip in his group with the smell of money on lap five just too tempting.A large scratch group, who would normally race through like a well-oiled machine, seemed to be under a bit of pressure as Watson, Montgomery and McKee started to hit the front. It wasnrsquot long before scratch group had split completely and the three men were on their own.By lap four they were a mere  seconds from catching the last group ahead of them and it was then that McKee would lose contact and fall back to what was left of a scratch group.Behind, racers would try to put groups together as pretty much everybody looked like they were trying far too hard. No one had an easy ride in the bunch with no rest on this course. Laura Wylie would show her form holding on to her fast group until the final laps to take the first female prize. Martina Hawkins was pushing for performance of the night as, having made a slow start, would pick up positions as the lapped ticked by and would take second female.At the head of the race Monty and Watson would push each other to the limit with neither giving an inch. It would come down to a sprint for the victory. With a final effort it would Lindsay Watson who would just take the win from Monty.The final podium place was up for grabs and a sizeable group would be in contention. On the final corner, it would be Nathan Mullan who made the decision to go long and hold his sprint all the way to the line.Nathan would claim his third place as well as Dromararsquos Road Race Club Champion for  .With positions to fight for there, were several riders looking that they needed a well-earned rest and a hot dog.The great news was that not only was there a hot dog, but biscuits, tea, coffee and even some juice provided at the Dromara Connect building in the village. Many thanks to all the helpers who organised the food ndash which seemed to go down very well.A final thanks to all the competitors for supporting this new race as well as the kind comments which are always great to hear.It was great to see a big showing from Dromore, WDWrsquos, VC Glendale, Banbridge and Shimna as well as all the other cycling clubs.A big shout out to Dromara Connect for providing the food and hall for the presentations, to the off-roaders who were in charge of marshalling running the event and the motorcycle riders who lead the groups around a truly first class job..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Need for flexibility over Castlewellan road works  ","story":"MAJOR concern has been raised about the impact a gas pipe laying scheme will have on Castlewellan businesses over the summer months.South Down MP Chris Hazzard, Emma Rogan MLA and Slieve Croob councillor Roisin Howell met with representatives from Phoenix Natural Gas last week, calling for a suspension of work during July and August.There is concern about the impact of the work on high profile tourism events including the Ulster Fleadh, Soma Festival and Castlewellan Agricultural Show.Cllr Howell said Castlewellan needed to be open for business this summer, highlighting the need for a ldquosensible and workable solution in relation to works due to take place.She said that while Phoenix produced a compromise so traders would be afforded every opportunity to make a living and the lively summer season would not be negatively impacted on, roads officials were ldquounwilling to show any flexibility.She continued: ldquoThe works must be temporarily suspended to allow businesses to operate unhindered during the two most important months of the year. We also have the Soma Festival and Ulster Fleadh which will bring in thousands of visitors, boosting the economy.Ms Rogan confirmed that a meeting is being sought with senior roads officials to discuss the issue, encouraging people to attend a public information event at The Lodge in the town tonight at pm. It will be attended by roads and Phoenix representatives to discuss the planned work.A Phoenix spokeswoman said that as part of its investment to bring the benefits of natural gas to  towns across East Down, the company will be working across the Castlewellan area in the coming weeks.ldquoWe have communicated with impacted residents and traders who have been invited to find out more about the upcoming works at a public information event tonight, she explained.ldquoWe are aware of upcoming festivities taking place across the town and continue to review the most appropriate ways to mitigate against unnecessary disruption.The spokeswoman added: ldquoIn scheduling these works, we have liaised with relevant statutory authorities and agencies to ensure a co-ordinated approach to works taking place across the wider East Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New plan to revamp retail core unveiled  ","story":"SPECIALIST consultants are to be appointed to take a critical look at future retail development opportunities across the districtrsquos main towns.The move mdash sanctioned by local politicians and which could cost up to pound, mdash is part of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos development plan which will map out future residential, retail, commercial and industrial development over the next  years.Traders in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Ballynahinch are among those in seven towns across the district who will be asked for their views as part of the comprehensive study which will gather evidence to help guide future planning policies and assess the need for additional retail and leisure floorspace.Signicantly, local planners say that existing masterplan proposals for Downpatrick and Ballynahinch are now out-of-date, as is a plan for the future of Newcastle which formed part of the South East Coast masterplan.Planners say a fresh look at the future of the local towns is required as the previous plans do not provide a ldquoreliableevidence base upon which to develop a new retail and commercial leisure strategy for the district.Councillors were told this week that the production of a new retail and commercial leisure study has the potential to bring wider benefits by underpinning future masterplan proposals and formulation of economic development policies.The vitality of viability of town centres will also be examined as part of the new study with existing town boundaries also coming under the microscope.Consultants will also examinecurrent retail and leisure offering satisfies customer demand and the potential for new development sites.Agreement to press ahead with the survey, which will also look at hotel, restaurant and bar provision, came at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.The specialist retail consultants will support the ongoing work of the team behind the districtrsquos new local development plan with the proposed study expected to start before the end of the summer.The town centre assessments will focus on catchment areas, available expenditure and future development pressures.Strategic planning policy requires local authorities to undertake assessments of the need or capacity for retail and other town centre uses, with the former Department of the Environment previously advising isional planners on retail impact issues in their respective areas.When responsibility for planning was devolved from Belfast to local councils, no specialist staff from the planning retail team transferred to Newry, Mourne and Down.Councillors were told this week that itrsquos not considered there is the expertise within the local authorityrsquos planning department to undertake a ldquorobust retail and leisure needs and capacity survey in the district, prompting the needs to appoint specialist consultants.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran, the vice-chairman of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, has welcomed the new review.He is particularly pleased that the business community across the districtrsquos three main towns will be asked for its views.Cllr Curran said it was ldquocritically important that their opinions are factored into the future development of their respective towns to help secure new investment and attract more shoppers, boosting the districtrsquos economy.ldquoAn overarching survey of the districtrsquos retail and leisure needs is vital moving forward and the local authority should be congratulated on this approach, he said.ldquoA series of workshops are planned to provide traders with an opportunity have an input into the process and these must not be squandered.ldquoThe survey will take a critical look at what we have and what we need in the short, medium and long term future. Elected representatives will be asked for their views but, in my opinion, it is those in the business community which carry the most weight.Cllr Curran also welcomed confirmation that hotels, restaurants and other forms of leisure provision including local pubs will feature in the survey.He added: ldquoI am looking forward to the survey getting underway and will be very interested to see

outline business case designed to pave the way for a poundm tourism bonanza in Newcastle.It has been confirmed this week that local council officials are progressing the business case for a series of highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort.The ious proposals are at the heart of the Mournes Gateway investment initiative which is one of a series of projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The local council hopes to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.In addition, local authority officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the gateway project and to move its ious components through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The Mournes Gateway project also includes an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Various aspects of the Newcastle tourism plan have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency, with the overarching vision of the project to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Pop up beach plan aims to boost tourism  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/9412152.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business

PICTURE BY STEPHEN DAVISONThe Gettys are home in the Province for their now-annual Getty Music Worship Conference in Assembly Buildings which took place last night and again this morning as well as tonight’s sold-out concert in the SSE Arena.Keith said: “It’s always good to be back home. We spend nine months of the year in Nashville and three months on the north coast. There’s nowhere as beautul on earth.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog His we Kristyn added: “We have four little girls, eight and under, so it’s great for them to spend some quality time with grandparents and cousins and friends and church folk that we know here. We try to come home over the summer for an extended time when school is off. We try to reduce the number of times in the year we might have to deal with jetlag.”Keith said it still makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end when hearing people sing one of the Getty’s hymns: “It’s very special for us. I’ve been at funeral services and heard them sung, I’ve been at bedsides where I’ve heard them sung.“It’s inspiring in dferent ways – that’s why we write hymns, for people to sing, whether it’s a melody that thousands of people can sing in an arena or for  people to sing in the wee Presbyterian Church around the corner.”Looking ahead to tonight’s SSE Arena show Kristyn said: “I’ve got butterflies in my tummy. It’s excitement more than nerves.“Three of our four girls will be there. The baby will be in bed.”Keith said: “There is something special about [tonight].

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mr Hancock expressed condolences to the families who have lost loved ones, and promised a root-and-branch review of food sold and served in hospitals.He added: ldquoI promise there will be a full and thorough investigation, and severe consequencesthere is any evidence of wrongdoing.Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth, who asked an urgent question on the issue, said: ldquoOur thoughts really must be with the families of those who have lost their lives.He added: ldquoI have been speaking to hospital catering staff in recent days and they have raised with me concerns about the tight finances, and that years of capital cuts have left kitchens substandard, and this has driven a move to greater outsourcing of catering, with sandwiches and soups steadily replacing hot meals.ldquoRecent data shows some hospitals spending less than pound per patient per day.ldquoDo you agree that this review should be backed up by investment in hospital catering, in facilities, and legally-backed clear minimum quality standards for hospital food  -- --Mr Hancock replied: ldquoIt is important to have the best quality food in hospitals. I am completely open to upgrading hospital equipmentthat is what is necessary andit provides value for money.ldquoI have been struck by the number of hospital chief executives that have said that, from the point of view of patient satisfaction, staff morale, and nutrition and the quality of food, bringing those food supplies in house is the best thing they have done.Answering Tory Sir Bill Cashrsquosquestion, Mr Hancock said: ldquoHersquos quite right to identy that this is a supply chain issue and that therersquos a complex supply chain in operation.SNP health and social care spokeswoman Dr Philippa Whitford raised the question of the incubation period and whether surveillance of trusts would continue at the same time as the investigation.She said: ldquoThese sandwiches were sold to  trusts and while there have been no cases since the th May the incubation of listeriosis is  days. She added: ldquoCan I ask him to pay particular attention to why on earth people who were seriously ill or frail were being fed sandwiches. Someone who has no appetite and is recovering from illness is simply not going to be tempted by a pack of sandwiches and therefore that really makes the case for bringing food preparation in hospital and producing tempting meals because nutrition is critical to recovery.Labourrsquos Lucy Powellraised outsourcing adding: ldquoSurely wersquove got to be a lot firmer here in identying that this growth in outsourcing food supplies is leading to some real safety issues and potentially to these deaths themselves.Tory Maria Caulfieldraised the issue of food spending and staffing levels.She said: ldquoWhile therersquos no evidence that cost is behind the tragic cases that wersquove heard of today, would the secretary of state in his root-and-branch review look at the price that hospitals are spending on food, a pound per meal is not enough for a healthy, nutritious meal for patients, some trusts are spending less than pound a day on patient food.ldquoWould he also look at legislating for safe staffing levels so therersquos enough nurses on the wards to feed patients, about a third of patients are eating less than half of the food that is served before them and are suffering from malnutrition.Mr Hancock replied: ldquoThose hospitals that have brought food production in-house and sourced locally-produced food not necessarily locally distributed food, but properly locally-produced food, have often found that it reduces costs rather than raises them.

Then he signalled in a tweet that he was scrapping the account. But  hours later, the account remained open under its old ldquoelonmusk handle with  million followers.Just deleted my Twitter accountmdash Daddy DotComJune , Mr Musk has used his Twitter account to pull pranks and make baffling changes in the past. In February, he suddenly changed his handle to ldquoelontusk. When he was later asked by reporters why he made the change, he confessed: ldquoI was just playing the fool on Twitter.His apparent intention to leave Twitter after a decade on the social media service attracted widespread attention largely because his account has turned into a hornetrsquos nest during the past year.The biggest flap occurred last August when he tweeted that he had lined up the financing necessary to buy Tesla in a buyout that would probably have cost more than  billion dollars, causing the electric car makerrsquos stock to swing wildly. An offer never materialised, and the Securities and Exchange Commission later accused Mr Musk of using Twitter to mislead investors.He denied the allegations, but he and Tesla eventually reached a  million dollar settlement with the SEC after regulators threatened to seek his removal as the companyrsquos CEO. Instead, he agreed to step down as Teslarsquos chairman for at least three years and also stipulated that his tweets tied to the company be pre-screened for accuracy.Twitter got Mr Musk into trouble again in February when the SEC alleged a tweet about how many cars Tesla will manufacture this year represented another misleading statement and sought to hold him in contempt of court for violating the settlement. That resulted in a new settlement that is supposed to put even tighter controls on his tweets about the company.Mr Musk is also embroiled in a defamation lawsuit for a tweet that described a British er involved in a rescue of boys trapped in an underwater cave in Thailand as a paedophile. That tweet, posted last July, has since been deleted, and Mr Musk is fighting the lawsuit filed by Vernon Unsworth in a Los Angeles state court..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Elon Musk says he has deleted Twitter account article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
